 Tests being offered prior to or without an EUA under the policies outlined in the FDA's Policy for Coronavirus Disease-2019 Tests have not yet been reviewed by the FDA, are not FDA authorized, and have not received a CLIA categorization. While FDA has indicated that such tests may be appropriate for use in clinical laboratories and by healthcare workers at the point of care, the policies in the Policy for Coronavirus Disease-2019 Tests do not provide a CLIA categorization and do not override any CLIA requirements. Therefore, in accordance with CLIA, tests offered under these policies are considered high complexity by default until or unless they are authorized and deemed to be appropriate, through an EUA authorization or general FDA review processes, to be performed as moderate or waived complexity tests.
Laboratories using tests being marketed under the FDA's EUA policy should be mindful of CLIA requirements which are enforced by CMS and certain State authorities, and CMS guidance for laboratories during the COVID-19 public health emergency. Under CMS guidance, if a facility has the appropriate CLIA certificates and follows applicable CLIA regulations, state regulations and guidelines, the laboratory's CLIA certificate can be extended to cover testing in areas outside of the designated primary site or home base such as contiguous buildings, or any other designated temporary overflow location in its facility or temporary remote location, such as a parking lot. https://www.cms.gov/files/document/qso-20-21-clia.pdf-0 <SEP>  When tests are offered prior to or without an EUA under the FDA's Policy for Coronavirus Disease-2019 Tests, what is their CLIA categorization? <EOS>

You can protect your little one by avoiding large crowds and keeping a safe distance
               (at least 6 feet) from other people when out of the house.
At home and in public, do all you can to help stop the spread of the virus:

Avoid people who are sick.
Wash your hands well and often, and teach others in your home to do the same.
               This is especially important:
               
when you go back into your home from being outside
before handling your child
before breastfeeding
               or preparing a bottle or food


Clean surfaces and objects that people touch a lot (like doorknobs, countertops,
               and cellphones).
Try not to touch your eyes, nose, and mouth.
Sneeze or cough into a tissue or your elbow, not your hands.
Wear a mask at home if you are sick. Try to limit contact with your child until
               your symptoms have stopped.
If you take your child out in an infant carrier, you can place a blanket over
               the carrier while it's within your view. Make sure the blanket doesn't touch the baby.

Implement the following restrictions now:

Limit points of entry to the facility. Visitors, volunteers, and non-essential healthcare personnel (HCP) must be restricted from the facility, except for end-of-life situations.
Restrict all residents to their room and enforce social distancing. Cancel all group activities and communal dining.
Residents should be allowed to leave only for medically necessary purposes (e.g., hemodialysis), and should wear a facemask (if tolerated) when they leave.
Designate a location to cohort residents with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.

Identify cases as early as possible by actively screening all residents daily for fever and respiratory symptoms (pulse oximetry).

Long-term care (LTC) residents with COVID-19 may show atypical symptoms including new or worsening malaise, new dizziness, diarrhea, or sore throat.  Identification of these symptoms should prompt isolation and further evaluation.

Institute staffing recommendations at the facility:

Screen HCP for fever and respiratory symptoms at the beginning of their shift.  If they are ill, have them put on a facemask and leave the workplace.
Implement universal use of facemasks for HCP while in the facility, as supply allows.
Designate HCP who will be responsible for caring for COVID-19 patients.
To mitigate staffing shortages, exposed HCP may continue to work while wearing a facemask as long as they remain asymptomatic.  Testing exposed, asymptomatic HCP is not advised.

Follow environmental cleaning and disinfection procedures consistently and correctly.

Management of laundry, food service utensils, and medical waste should be performed in accordance with routine procedures. <SEP> Now that community transmission is widespread, what actions will help prevent the spread in long-term care facilities? <EOS>
​Generally, Pennsylvania law requires that employees be paid for all hours worked.

WHO has detailed recommendations on the amount of physical activity people of all ages should do to benefit their health and wellbeing. (available here for children under age of 5 and here for youth, adults and olders) Here are the minimum levels we recommend:Infants under the age of 1 year need to be physically active several times a day.
    Children under 5 years of age should spend at least 180 minutes a day in physical activities, with 3-4 year-olds being moderately or vigorously active for an hour a day.
    Children and adolescents aged 5-17yearsall children and adolescents should do at least 60 minutes a day of moderate to vigorous-intensity physical activity, including activities that strengthen muscle and bone, at least 3 days per week.Adults aged over 18 years should do a total of at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity throughout the week, or at least 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity throughout the week, including muscle-strengthening activities 2 or more days per
        week.
    older adults with poor mobility should do physical activity to enhance balance and prevent falls on 3 or more days per week.
      But any physical activity is better than none.  Start with small amounts and gradually increase duration, frequency and intensity over time. Being active during the COVID-19 pandemic is challenging for us all.  Because the opportunities to be physically active seem to be more restricted, it is even more important to plan in every day the ways to be active and to reduce the time spent
    sitting for long periods. Put simply, it is a critical time to ensure we all move more and sit less. <SEP> How much physical activity is recommended? <EOS>
Contact your local health department about staff exposed to COVID-19 and follow any testing and quarantine advice. <SEP> Do we have to isolate staff exposed to a person with COVID-19 even if they were wearing PPE? <EOS>
Yes. Homeless shelters are often overcrowded and understaffed, making it difficult to properly enforce social distancing and appropriate hygiene measures, so individuals living in shelters—and unhoused individuals more broadly—are at high-risk for contracting COVID-19. Further, homeless individuals disproportionately suffer from asthma, diabetes, heart disease, and other chronic illnesses, which contribute to the severity of COVID-19 symptoms and effects. While the federal government’s stimulus package includes funding to help shelters and the homeless population, capacity and hygiene issues at shelters will persist. (Dr. Josh Sharfstein, 4/8/20)

Methods for the two-week cumulative incidence map and the epidemic curve map are based on guidance from the CDC. National-level maps can be accessed here. 
Two-Week Cumulative Incidence Rate
The two-week cumulative incidence rate summarizes new cases reported in the past two weeks per 100,000 people. It looks at recent incidence to capture the potential burden of currently ill people who may be infectious and/or currently accessing healthcare. 
The sum of each region’s number of reported cases in the past two weeks (in other words, the difference between the total number of cases from two weeks ago from the current total number of cases) is divided by that region’s population. The resulting rate is multiplied by 100,000 to get a two-week cumulative incidence rate per 100,000 people.
Low: There have been 10 or fewer new cases per 100,000 people in the past two weeks.
Moderate: There have been between 10 and 50 new cases per 100,000 people in the past two weeks.
Moderately high: There have been between 50 and 100 new cases per 100,000 people in the past two weeks.
High: There have been more than 100 new cases per 100,000 people in the past two weeks.
Current Epidemic Curve
The current epidemic curve categorizes counties into phases of the epidemic curve based on two-week incidence and recent slope. It provides a more detailed view into the burden of illness and the trajectory of new illnesses. 
Counties are categorized based on (1) the number of new cases per 100,000 in the past two weeks, and (2) the trajectory of the three-day moving average daily incidence per 100,000. By hovering over each region, you can see a figure detailing how three-day moving averages of daily incidence and the corresponding phase of the epidemic curve have changed over the past month. 
The ‘Two-Week Cumulative Incidence Rate’ section above details how the number of new cases per 100,000 in the past two weeks is calculated for each region.
Three-day moving average daily incidence rates per 100,000 are calculated for each region by first totalling the number of new cases by date reported to the state. The total number of cases reported on each day is divided by each region’s population, and multiplied by 100,000 to get a daily incidence rate per 100,000 people. The three-day moving average is the mean of daily incidence rates per 100,000 for the current and past two days. 
Low incidence growth: There have been ten or fewer new cases per 100,000 in the past two weeks. Incidence is low, but increasing.
Elevated incidence growth: There have been more than ten new cases per 100,000 in the past two weeks. Incidence is high and increasing.
Elevated incidence plateau: There have been more than ten new cases per 100,000 in the past two weeks. Incidence is high and remaining stable.
Sustained decline: Incidence is consistently decreasing. 
Low incidence plateau: There have been ten or fewer new cases per 100,000 in the past two weeks. Incidence is low and remaining stable.
Region-Specific Incidence
For regions with >5 cases in the past two weeks, a smoothing trend line was fit to three-day moving average incidence by date reported to the state. 
The magnitude and direction of change of the smoothing trend line is shown below incidence. This line describes the changes that are occurring in the above smoothing trend line. <SEP> What does the incidence data mean? <EOS>

Symptoms from the seasonal flu and COVID-19 are not very different. A person sick with either the flu or COVID-19 may experience fever, fatigue, a cough, and shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. A person infected with COVID-19 may also have no obvious symptoms. Medical testing is necessary to determine whether a sick individual has COVID-19 or another illness. An important thing to know about COVID-19 is that it is highly inflammatory and can cause multiple organ failure in extreme cases.
According to data in the World Health Organization - China report based on 55,924 laboratory confirmed cases, typical COVID-19 signs and symptoms include: fever (87.9%), dry cough (67.7%), fatigue (38.1%), sputum production (33.4%), shortness of breath (18.6%), sore throat (13.9%), headache (13.6%), myalgia or arthralgia (14.8%), chills (11.4%), nausea or vomiting (5.0%), nasal congestion (4.8%), diarrhea (3.7%), hemoptysis (0.9%), and conjunctival congestion (0.8%).

As of June 15, child care centers can reopen for all clients.
If you were using a child care center before the public health crisis, you should contact them to learn of their plans. If you need help finding child care, contact your local Child Care Resource and Referral (CCR&R) Agency.
Child care centers must follow all safety guidelines detailed by the Department of Children and Families, including:

Screening staff and children for fever and other COVID-19 symptoms prior to entry to the program facility each day;
Minimizing group sizes to 10 children and limiting movement between groups;
Ensuring that the spacing of groups allows for ten feet of separation between groups at all times;
Taking steps to preclude crowding at pick up and drop off times;
Strictly limiting the sharing of supplies, food, toys, and other items;
Prohibiting field trips and other off-site activities, with the exception of activities within walking distance of the facility;
Strictly limiting and discouraging close person to person contact (hugging, wrestling, games involving touching or tagging);
Requiring staff to wear cloth masks unless doing so would inhibit the individual's health – when feasible, children over age two should wear face coverings within the facility;
Continuing to teach and reinforce healthy hygiene practices to prevent the spread of COVID-19;
Restricting all visitors - except for emergency/law enforcement personnel in their official capacity and Department of Children Families personnel for child protection or child care licensing purposes – to after operating hours;
Implementing enhanced cleaning and sanitation practices;
Planning for and abiding by procedures for response to COVID-19 exposure;
Completing DCF Office of Licensing daily log; and
Requiring notices and wall signs to be posted on entry and exit doors, in diapering areas, and in restrooms.

For further details on safety guidelines, see the Guidance for New Jersey Child Care Facilities on COVID-19 Related Health and Safety Requirements and see the Department of Children and Families' COVID-19 resources for licensed childcare. Each child care center must submit an attestation to the Department of Children and Families no later than 24 hours prior to the anticipated opening date, or in the case of currently operating emergency child care centers, within fourteen days of the effective date of Executive Order No. 149, attesting that it will follow all applicable health and safety standards.

There are reports of skin issues in COVID-19 patients, but these symptoms alone don’t mean you have the virus. Hive-like itchy rashes, pink-reddish spots, or reddish-purple patches on the toes or fingers of COVID-19 patients have mostly been seen in children and young adults. These symptoms seem to follow a mild case of COVID-19. Little is known about why this happens. Based on just this symptom, you would not qualify for testing.  You should watch for symptoms such as fever, dry cough, or shortness of breath and you should self-quarantine, practice social distancing, and hand washing.

You could postpone. Lots of people are. If you really want to be able to celebrate with everyone you love in person, be flexible about choosing a date — you wouldn’t want to have to re-cancel.
Long-held wedding decorum may no longer be applicable, especially when it comes to uninviting guests. To avoid having to retract invitations, Steve Moore, an owner of Sinclair and Moore Events in Seattle, says couples should either skip the save-the-date cards or include a disclaimer noting they plan to adhere to state and federal guidelines for gatherings. “We’ll ask in advance for your flexibility, understanding and grace,” he offered as a suggestion.
You could try to host a wedding over Zoom (or a drive-in theater). Maybe your first or second anniversary is the big party instead, which you can host without the pressure. 
Or, just invite your very closest people to celebrate in person, making sure they all get tested and swabbed before you all get together.

Having the ability to look at this virus through the lens of its impact on specific cities and towns will help us identify potential “hot spots,” inform the public health response, assist cities and towns working to slow the spread of this disease, and help the state appropriately deploy resources. <SEP> Why are COVID-19 cases in Massachusetts now being reported at the city/town level? <EOS>
If you traveled internationally, the CDC says you should stay home for 14 days after returning home. During those 14 days, be sure to take these steps:

Take your temperature with a thermometer twice a day and monitor for a fever. You can use this temperature log to monitor your temperature. And watch for coughing or trouble breathing. 
Stay home and avoid contact with others. Do not go to work or school.
Do not use public transportation, taxis, or ride-share services.
Keep your distance from others (about 6 feet or 2 meters).

If you traveled domestically, it depends on the state. Some state or local governments require those who have recently traveled to stay home for 14 days. Covid-19 cases and deaths have been reported in all 50 states, and the situation is constantly changing. 
“Because travel increases your chances of getting infected and spreading COVID-19, staying home is the best way to protect yourself and others from getting sick,” the CDC says.

Most children who become infected with SARS-CoV-2 experience no symptoms or mild symptoms. A small but growing number of cases of inflammatory illness affecting the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, or gastrointestinal organs in children, however, has been reported around the US and the world. The syndrome, called Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), has not been definitively linked to COVID-19, but most children with MIS-C have tested positive for active COVID-19 infections or antibodies indicating a prior infection. MIS-C can be serious and even fatal, but most children diagnosed with this condition have improved with medical care. The CDC has dedicated a team to MIS-C and are working as swiftly as they can to learn more about the illness. A list of symptoms to watch for in children and signs indicating a need for emergency care is here. Parents and caretakers should take care to prevent their children’s exposure to coronavirus and call their pediatrician with any concerns. (Dr. Josh Sharfstein, 5/27/20) <SEP> What do we know about the inflammatory symptoms in children with COVID-19? <EOS>
In the vast majority of cases, children still don’t need to be tested. Children with COVID-19 typically only have mild cold symptoms, instead of the more serious illness seen in adults. One benefit of testing is to inform the child and parent of the infection, which may help prevent further transmission. The need for testing is a discussion you should have with your pediatrician.  
Regardless of testing, if your child gets a cold, adults in the home should take extra care to not catch the cold—and frequently wash their hands and disinfect surfaces.   
If a child has more severe symptoms—persistent high fever, trouble breathing and not eating or drinking well—call your pediatrician. “I would encourage parents to reach out to their pediatrician first,” he says. “But if it’s severe and the child is getting worse, then you need to go to an emergency department.” <SEP> Should my child be tested? <EOS>
It’s important to start thinking about recovery because it signals to people there will be another side to this. We can't tell you when that's going to be, but there's going to be a time beyond and we can start thinking about it now.
Lots of businesses are having challenges getting the capital that they need to keep going right now – so that should be an immediate priority. But just the process of convening a group of business leaders to start thinking about the aftermath is a sign of hope. In the aftermath of World War II, we knew millions of people would be flooding back into the labor market. Business leaders were brought together around the country to try to figure out how to do that locally. It’s probably too early to try to put policies in place, and you have to be careful not to signal that we're on the downside of the slope, but it's not too early to contemplate and start working together on the longer-term issues. (Dutch Leonard, 4/6/20)
This won’t be a case of, “Now we're ready, flip the switch.” It's going to be gradual. An important question to bring up with businesses is, what could that look like? How do you operate at a level of one or two out of ten? In Singapore, for example, they had restaurants open but with tape blocking every other chair. The more you can think about and plan those gradations, the more you may feel comfortable saying, “Okay, everyone, let's go to phase one." (Dr. Josh Sharfstein, 4/6/20)
What just happened may have felt like the flip of an on-off switch, but we need to think about recovery as a dimmer. It’s going to go up slowly, then it might have to come back down in response to a local outbreak. Business leaders also have to think about how to move from six or seven out of ten back down to two? There is tremendous work going on in this regard and we are learning from other countries, often the risks of what happens if they open too soon. (Juliette Kayyem, 4/6/20)
If you're investing in public health solutions, building that call center or the capacity to isolate and trace and quarantine, then you're going to be able to stay higher on that dimmer switch longer. It’s an investment in being able to turn on more things faster. In Singapore, they have hundreds of people to jump on infections when they happen and that gives them confidence to be able to open businesses.

While it is difficult to determine exactly how long viruses can stay intact outside the body, since it is so dependent on environmental conditions, different viruses do appear to have different levels of resiliency. Flu viruses, for example, are generally rendered harmless after nine hours on hard surfaces and four hours on soft surfaces. The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which is in the same virus family as COVID-19 virus, lasts for two days on hard surfaces. A recent study concluded that human coronaviruses can last on surfaces at room temperature for up to 9 days. The World Health Organization's early estimates suggest that COVID-19 virus can survive on hard surfaces for a few hours, or up to several days.
Drafted: 10 March 2020. <SEP> What is the survivability of the COVID-19 virus as compared to other viruses? <EOS>
We don’t know yet. Early scientific data suggest that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can be inactivated by the sun’s UV light. However, the ability of the sun’s UV light to inactivate the virus on surfaces (such as handrails and in bathrooms) and shared objects (such as kickboards and pool noodles) needs more research. Factors — such as cloudiness, latitude (distance from equator), time of day, and amount of time exposed to the sun’s UV light — will determine how effectively the virus is inactivated.
Remember to clean surfaces and shared objects before disinfecting them and to follow directions on labels of cleaning products and disinfectantsexternal icon. <SEP> Can the sun’s ultraviolet (UV) light disinfect surfaces and shared objects? <EOS>
Unfortunately, despite various rumors online that hot drinks kill the virus, this is untrue. It’s a myth. Your immune system does the work of ridding you of any virus, and it does this best when it is strong. For the average healthy person without underlying conditions who has been given the go-ahead to recover from this virus at-home, having hot drinks can’t hurt as a form of comfort, relief and hydration. So, go ahead and have your favorite teas and other hot drink concoctions for these reasons but don’t be lulled into any sense that they’re doing anything to get rid of the COVID-19 virus. (Information sourced from: Reeders, Snow, Harris-Roxas and Yarwood, 2020) <SEP> Does drinking hot water stop the COVID-19 virus? <EOS>
 Yes, as long  as certain requirements are met. Pursuant to Executive Order 202.10, subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (2) of  subdivision (g) of 10 NYCRR section 405.4 was modified to the extent necessary  to allow graduates of foreign medical schools having at least one  year of graduate medical education to provide patient care in hospitals, so as  to allow such graduates without licenses to provide patient care in hospitals  if they have completed at least one year of graduate medical education.

Hospitalized patients can be discharged when they are well enough to return home and if the home environment is suitable for completing their isolation period.The decision to discontinue Transmission-Based Precautions for patients with confirmed COVID-19 should be made using either a symptom-based (i.e., time-since-illness-onset and time-since-recovery strategy) or time-based strategy as described below. A test-based strategy could be considered for discontinuing Transmission-Based Precautions earlier than if the symptom-based strategy were used, however, many individuals will have prolonged viral shedding so this strategy is no longer recommended. A person’s immune status and the severity of their illness must be considered when selecting a strategy. Meeting criteria for discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions is not a prerequisite for discharge.
Patients with COVID-19 with mild to moderate illness who are not severely immunocompromised should remain in Transmission-Based Precautions until:
Symptom-based strategy

At least 10 days have passed since symptoms first appeared and
At least 24 hours have passed since last fever without the use of fever-reducing medications and
Symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath) have improved

Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who have NOT had any symptoms and who are NOT severely immunocompromised should remain in Transmission-Based Precautions until:

10 days have passed since the date of their first positive viral diagnostic test

Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who are severely immunocompromised and who have NOT had any symptoms should remain in Transmission-Based Precautions until:

at least 10 days and up to 20 days have passed since the date of their first positive viral diagnostic test

Patients with severe to critical illness or who are severely immunocompromised.
Symptom-based strategy

At least 10 days and up to 20 days have passed since symptoms first appeared and
At least 24 hours have passed since last fever without the use of fever-reducing medications and
Symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath) have improved
Consider consultation with infection control experts

Except for rare situations, a test-based strategy is no longer recommended to determine when an individual with SARS-CoV-2 infection is no longer infectious (e.g., to discontinue Transmission-Based Precautions or home isolation). In some instances, a test-based strategy could be considered for discontinuing Transmission-based Precautions earlier than if symptom-based precautions were used. However, many individuals will have prolonged viral shedding, limiting the utility of this approach. A test-based strategy could also be considered for some patients (e.g., those who are severely immunocompromised) in consultation with local infectious diseases experts if concerns exist for the patient being infectious for more than 20 days.
The criteria for the test-based strategy are:
Patients who are symptomatic:

Resolution of fever without the use of fever-reducing medication and
Symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath) have improved, and
Results are negative from at least two consecutive respiratory specimens collected ≥24 hours apart (total of two negative specimens) using an FDA-authorized molecular viral assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA.

Patients who are not symptomatic:

Results are negative from at least two consecutive respiratory specimens collected ≥24 hours apart (total of two negative specimens) using an FDA-authorized molecular viral assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA.

Note that detecting viral RNA via PCR does not necessarily mean that infectious virus is present.
Criteria to discontinue Transmission-Based Precautions can be found in Discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions and Disposition of Patients with COVID-19 in Healthcare Settings (Interim Guidance). <SEP> When can hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 be discharged from the hospital? <EOS>
Common symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, dry cough, fatigue, loss of appetite, loss of smell, and body ache. In some people, COVID-19 causes more severe symptoms like high fever, severe cough, and shortness of breath, which often indicates pneumonia.A person may have mild symptoms for about one week, then worsen rapidly. Let your doctor know if your symptoms quickly worsen over a short period of time. Also call the doctor right away if you or a loved one with COVID-19 experience any of the following emergency symptoms: trouble breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion or inability to arouse the person, or bluish lips or face. <SEP> Can COVID-19 symptoms worsen rapidly after several days of illness? <EOS>
 If you would like to develop and offer a diagnostic test for testing any individual regardless of whether they are suspected of COVID-19 by a healthcare provider -- including the screening of asymptomatic individuals without known exposure with the intent of making decisions based on the test results -- please see the Molecular Diagnostic Template for Commercial Manufacturers or Molecular Diagnostic Template for Laboratories for recommendations on how to validate the test for this intended use and submit your EUA request to the FDA. As outlined in the Policy for Coronavirus Disease-2019 Tests, the FDA is providing regulatory flexibility for developers that offer validated diagnostic tests, including for screening of asymptomatic individuals, while the developers pursue an EUA from the FDA.
Diagnostic tests that are authorized for use on individuals suspected of COVID-19 by their healthcare provider are authorized for use on symptomatic individuals and asymptomatic individuals suspected of having COVID-19, such as because they have been exposed to an infected individual. Diagnostic tests offered by the test developer for the screening of any asymptomatic individual, however, are to be validated by their developers and authorized by the FDA specifically for screening purposes.
The FDA recognizes that the CDC has issued guidance relating to screening and that organizations may want to conduct screening of asymptomatic individuals as part of a strategy to assure the safety of their employees, patients, students, and others. Screening using a highly sensitive test, especially given the asymptomatic testing population, leads to the most accurate results when rapid turnaround times are available.  The FDA has provided validation recommendations designed to establish high sensitivity for tests intended for screening in the templates referenced above. We encourage developers who want to offer a less sensitive test for screening to discuss validation approaches with us.
The FDA's EUA webpage provides information on the performance of each EUA-authorized test. However, available performance data may vary depending on how the test was validated. At the beginning of the pandemic, there were few patient specimens available and developers validated their tests using contrived specimens spiked with SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in different amounts. Doing so allowed tests to be validated quickly while providing a measure of confidence in test performance appropriate at that point in the public health emergency. However, validation with contrived specimens instead of patient samples does not provide a true determination of clinical performance (sensitivity and specificity) and, therefore, comparing the performance of tests using these different specimens, and identifying which ones are more sensitive, is difficult. As the pandemic progressed and more patient specimens became available, the FDA began recommending that developers validate their tests with actual patient specimens. Now, the FDA has developed a reference panel to use with EUA-authorized tests which will identify which tests are more sensitive than others. The FDA will make this information available on our website as it becomes available. <SEP>  I am a commercial test kit manufacturer or clinical laboratory offering a SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test.  Can I offer it for screening of asymptomatic individuals for COVID-19?

The CDC has posted instructions on its website for making and using cloth masks. If used properly and in conjunction with social distancing techniques, cloth masks can help slow the spread of the virus in the general population. Importantly, the CDC does not recommend that individuals wear surgical masks or N-95 respirators, as there is still a critical shortage of these supplies for healthcare workers and first responders.
Efforts to crowdsource effective PPE should precede calls for improvised masks. (This website helps match unused PPE to healthcare providers.) The CDC permits the use of cloth masks by health care providers only as a last resort, cautioning “[H]omemade masks are not considered PPE (personal protective equipment), since their capability to protect [providers] is unknown. Caution should be exercised when considering this option. Homemade masks should ideally be used in combination with a face shield that covers the entire front (that extends to the chin or below) and sides of the face.” (Dr. Josh Sharfstein, 4/11/20) <SEP> Is there official guidance on the efficacy of DIY face masks, and can these be donated for use in healthcare settings? <EOS>

As a previous state Homeland Security Advisor, I reflected on what I thought was going to happen in absence of a strong and unified federal response in The Atlantic. If there continues to be inaction at the federal level, there are some creative responses to counteract that, such as regional and tri-state purchasing. It is difficult to compete with New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, unless you are California. This is going to leave smaller states and less-rich states more vulnerable In the end, it is unlikely this White House will change; to date, there is still no national stay-at-home orders, though most states have instituted them on their own. What that means, at best, is that it leaves room for local ingenuity, including partnerships with local businesses. It is not ideal, we all recognize. (Juliette Kayyem, 4/1/20)
Members of Congress are horrified about what is going on in the supply chain, and experts have testified that a federal takeover of the supply chain is probably the best way to get resources where they need to go.

Ultraviolet light from the sun does kill the virus, but it does not do so instantaneously. You can contract the virus outdoors in the sunlight. Vitamin D does not kill the virus.

It is illegal for landlords to try to evict you themselves without  going to court.
There is a state order in place preventing landlords from evicting  individuals for nonpayment if such an individual qualifies for unemployment  insurance, or benefits under state or federal law, or otherwise has financial  hardship due to COVID-19. The order is in effect until at least August 20,  2020. 
There is also a federal order that protects tenants who live in public  housing, have a Section 8 rental voucher, or live in a building that has  federally backed mortgages or funding. These tenants may not be evicted for  nonpayment of rent. The order is in effect until at least July 24, 2020.
If your landlord wants to evict you, they will need to go to the housing  court and prove that you do not fall into one of these protected categories.
If you received a notice of eviction due to non-payment before March  16th, that notice is no longer valid. Your landlord must go back to the housing  court and receive permission to serve you a new notice.
The court will not default tenants who do not respond to an eviction  petition. Until further notice, no Housing Court can proceed if the tenant is  not represented by a lawyer. All eviction cases in which a tenant is currently  unrepresented by legal counsel are stayed for the time being.
We expect more changes on how Housing Court operates and handles eviction  cases. You can call 311 and ask for the Tenant Helpline to get the latest  updates, receive legal counseling, and learn about the resources.
If a landlord locks you out or tries to evict you illegally, you should  call 911 and show the police officer identification, lease or public utility  bill with your name and address. If you are unable to get back into your  apartment, you should contact the Court system at 833-503-0447 to find your closest emergency court. In NYC, you will be allowed to go  to Housing Court in your borough to file an emergency petition to be restored  to your apartment.

To decrease the burden for the research community and ensure that research participants continue to have the protections afforded to them through a Certificate during the HHS declared public health emergency for COVID-19, NIH determined to automatically extend the expiration dates for NIH issued but non-NIH funded CoCs that were current (i.e., not expired) as of April 15, 2020.   NIH funded COCs automatically extend for as long as the NIH funding continues, including any extensions.
Investigators and/or institutions should have received notification by email of the CoC extension and a new CoC Certificate with the revised CoC expiration date for their records.  The expiration date extension applies to your CoCs current (i.e., not expired) as of April 15, 2020 even if you did not receive a copy of the new Certificate.  CoC recipients are reminded that they are expected to abide by applicable laws and regulations, including the Certificate protections and disclosure requirements in 42 U.S.C. § 241(d), for data collected up to the new expiration date.
 
If you have an active CoC and did not receive a new Certificate, but would like to have one for your records, please contact NIH-CoC-Coordinator@mail.nih.gov. If NIH can verify your CoC was current as of April 15, 2020 an updated CoC will be emailed to you. If a current (i.e., not expired) certificate cannot be verified, you will need to apply for a new CoC if you want to provide CoC protections for new data collection. <SEP> 4.

If you have any concerns about your child, call your doctor's office for advice. Many practices are offering phone or telemedicine visits, and it's remarkable how many things can be addressed that way.Some things, though, may require an in-person appointment, including:
Illness or injury that could be serious, such as a child with trouble breathing, significant pain, unusual sleepiness, a high fever that won't come down, or a cut that may need stitches or a bone that may be broken. Call your doctor for guidance as to whether you should bring your child to the office or a local emergency room.
Children who are receiving ongoing treatments for a serious medical condition such as cancer, kidney disease, or a rheumatologic disease. These might include chemotherapy, infusions of other medications, dialysis, or transfusions. Your doctor will advise you about any changes in treatments or how they are to be given during the pandemic. Do not skip any appointments unless your doctor tells you to do so.
Checkups for very young children who need vaccines and to have their growth checked. Check with your doctor regarding their current policies and practices.
Checkups and visits for children with certain health conditions. This might include children with breathing problems whose lungs need to be listened to, children who need vaccinations to protect their immune system, children whose blood pressure is too high, children who aren't gaining weight, children who need stitches out or a cast off, or children with abnormal blood tests that need rechecking. If your child is being followed for a medical problem, call your doctor for advice. Together you can figure out when and how your child should be seen.
Bottom line: Talk to your doctor. The decision will depend on a combination of factors including your child's condition, how prevalent the virus is in your community, whether you have had any exposures or possible exposures, what safeguards your doctor has put into place, and how you would get to the doctor. <SEP> When do you need to bring your child to the doctor during this pandemic? <EOS>

No. It is estimated that official counts of infections underestimate the number of cases. First, due to a failure to test more people whether due to a lack of availability of testing kits or due to government protocols, we do not have a full and accurate count. Second, many infected people will display no or mild symptoms. Third, even those with symptoms may not seek medical attention. Finally, many healthcare systems do not have the means to count and report numbers of infections and some governments do not want to report the true numbers. Whatever the reason, we know that there are more cases than are counted.
Work led by a researcher at Northeastern University estimated that as of Wednesday, January 29th, 31,200 people in Wuhan alone could have been infected, compared to the reported 2,261 confirmed cases.

Start with: Should you throw a party? Is it necessary? Now? And is a party the best way to celebrate together? 
Again, the answers to these questions may very well be: yes. An elderly relative has a big birthday. You are getting married (more on this later). 
So. Invite a few people that you trust. Will they keep their masks on? And, if they forget, will they be open to gentle reminders? 
As for food and activities, keep it outside. Suggest that everyone bring their own blanket, food and utensils. A “bring your own dinner” is better than communal food, but if you go up one at a time to serve yourselves, you should be OK. You can even splash around, albeit at a safe distance.

Depending on the extent of contact a HCW had with a COVID-19 patient there may be work restrictions. CDC Interim U.S. Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of Healthcare Personnel with Potential Exposure in a Healthcare Setting to Patients with Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) should be used to assess the risk of the HCW and provide recommendations on monitoring and work restrictions. In addition, VDH created a HCW risk assessment tool using the CDC guidance that can be found under the “Resources” section on the VDH COVID-19 Healthcare Professionals website.
HCW could be exposed in the community or during travel.

 AHCCCS is adopting CMS guidance for dialysis treatment for the duration of the COVID emergency.  CMS is waiving the requirement that dialysis facilities have to provide services directly on its main premises or on other premises that are contiguous with the main premises. Dialysis facilities may enter nursing home/skilled nursing home facilities to provide dialysis service to its patients in those settings in order to limit community exposure. CMS continues to require that services provided to these nursing home residents are under the direction of the same governing body and professional staff as the resident’s usual Medicare-certified dialysis facility. Further, in order to ensure that care is safe, effective and is provided by trained and qualified personnel, CMS requires that the dialysis facility staff: furnish all dialysis care and services, provide all equipment and supplies necessary, maintain equipment and supplies in the nursing home, and complete all equipment maintenance, cleaning and disinfection using appropriate infection control procedures and manufacturer’s instructions for use.

For symptomatic carriers: If it’s been at least 10 days since your symptoms started and at least 24 hours since you’ve had a fever (without the help of fever-reducing medication) and your other symptoms have improved, you can go ahead and stop isolating, the CDC says.
Patients with severe illness may have to keep isolating for up to 20 days after symptoms started.
(But it’s important to note symptoms typically don’t show up until several days after infection — and you can be more contagious during this pre-symptomatic time. Also, symptoms can last for weeks or months — including in young people.) 
For asymptomatic carriers: People who tested positive but don’t have any symptoms can stop isolating 10 days after the first positive test – as long as they have not subsequently developed symptoms, the CDC says.
But 10 days is just a general guideline: “Because symptoms cannot be used to gauge where these individuals are in the course of their illness, it is possible that the duration of viral shedding could be longer or shorter than 10 days after their first positive test,” the CDC warned. With viral shedding, a person can infect others with the virus, even if they have no symptoms.
Asymptomatic carriers who have tested positive can also stop isolating if they get two negative test results from tests taken more than 24 hours apart. At that point, it’s very unlikely they are still contagious. <SEP> I tested positive for coronavirus weeks ago. How long are people contagious with Covid-19?

Currently, experts do not know exactly how long the virus can stay infectious because it is so new. Typically, viruses last longer on hard surfaces, like a countertop or plastic or metal playground equipment, than on soft surfaces, like a sleeve, because they depend on moisture to survive. Soft surfaces quickly absorb the moisture, leaving the virus unprotected and causing it to degrade more quickly. Scientists are estimating that the virus lasts for between a few hours to several days outside the body, and can last up to 24 hours on cardboard and 3 days on plastic or stainless steel.

Agreed health criteria are needed for the exclusion of athletes from competing and for allowing them to return to competition wherever appropriate. These should be consistent with public health guidelines for the general population, with risk profiles based on recent travel to high-risk community transmission zones, recent contact with individuals diagnosed with or suspected of having COVID-19, current symptomatology, etc. Athletes who are feeling unwell should not participate in events.If testing of athletes has been agreed with the local public health service there is a need to consider test availability, time taken for receipt of test results and host-country health services capacity. Criteria for exclusion of officials/judges from competition and for allowing them to return to competition where appropriate should follow guidance and criteria for the workplace.Requirements for the attendance of all athletes and other accredited participants should be put in place:–   health check: travel declaration and temperature screening–   contact tracing protocols ready (with all details of those present) –   allowing extra spacing (physical distancing)–   following all hygiene precautions.  Isolation procedures for athletes and other accredited participants (e.g. field-of-play staff, medical teams, officials who have close contact with the athletes) who feel unwell or become symptomatic should be clear and documented and rehearsed prior to holding the event, especially for higher risk sports, e.g. contact sports. <SEP> What should be the criteria for excluding an athlete or other accredited participant from competing? <EOS>
Restrictions upon certain business activities have been undertaken to control the spread of a communicable disease, COVID-19 as ordered by the Governor and the Secretary of Health.

I've heard people talk about the stress caused being together in one place. Everyone needs to recognize that a lot of the stress is coming from the context around the situation: This isn’t a snow day or a vacation with family. People are concerned and they are trying to do a lot of things like continuing school remotely or working from home, which places another layer of stress on families.
People should set reasonable expectations: The goal isn't to have a lot fun and or to be the most productive in school or at work. The goal is to figure out how to balance all the things people are being asked to do. This is a time when everyone has to provide comfort to each other and sometimes that means compromising on some of the gains that we expect, such as academic progress in kids.

The youth sports program should determine if masks should be worn by players after considering local conditions and checking state, local, territorial, or tribal health and safety laws, rules, and regulations with which youth sports organizations must comply. While playing sports, wearing cloth face coverings may be challenging for players, particularly for younger players and youth with disabilities and underlying medical conditions. Cloth face coverings should be worn by coaches, youth sports staff, officials, parents, and spectators as much as possible.
Masks are most important when physical distancing is difficult. Therefore, encourage social distancing as much as possible. People wearing masks should be reminded to not touch their mask and to wash their hands frequently. Information should be provided to all participants on the proper use, removal, and washing of masks. Masks should not be placed on:

Babies and children younger than 2 years old;
Anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious;
Anyone who is incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.

If a program determines that players should wear masks, it may be helpful to experiment with several different kinds in order to ensure comfort and fit.

The youth sports program should determine if masks should be worn by players after considering local conditions and checking state, local, territorial, or tribal health and safety laws, rules, and regulations with which youth sports organizations must comply. While playing sports, wearing cloth face coverings may be challenging for players, particularly for younger players and youth with disabilities and underlying medical conditions. Cloth face coverings should be worn by coaches, youth sports staff, officials, parents, and spectators as much as possible.
Masks are most important when physical distancing is difficult. Therefore, encourage social distancing as much as possible. People wearing masks should be reminded to not touch their mask and to wash their hands frequently. Information should be provided to all participants on the proper use, removal, and washing of masks. Masks should not be placed on:

Babies and children younger than 2 years old;
Anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious;
Anyone who is incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.

CDC has worked with state and jurisdictional health departments to improve reporting of critical case surveillance data elements such as age, race and ethnicity, and death. With thousands of cases being reported, the reporting of some data elements remains low, but state and jurisdictional health departments have continued to make improvements in completeness of data collection for COVID-19 through methods such as automated data flows. As the epidemic changes and number of new cases goes down, CDC and our state, tribal, local, and territorial partners will continue to evaluate the most efficient means to increase the completeness and availability of actionable public health data. <SEP> How has public health worked to improve reporting of critical information in COVID-19 case surveillance? <EOS>

 Yes, with restrictions. To help prevent COVID-19 transmission, there are several things individuals and businesses can do, including wearing a mask. Entertainment venues and tourists attractions are required to comply with rules listed in the Safer at Home health order. In addition to complying with the requirements, tourist attractions and entertainment venues are strongly encouraged to read and implement the Alabama Department of Public Health's Guidelines for Safeguarding All Businesses and Guidelines for Tourist Attractions and Entertainment Venues. Entertainment venues and tourists attractions include bowling alleys, arcades, concert venues, theaters, auditoriums, performing centers, museums, planetariums, race tracks, commercial or public playgrounds, adult entertainment venues, casinos, and bingo halls. <SEP>  Are tourists attractions and entertainment venues open? <EOS>
​You may qualify for PUA if you are the "primary caregiver" of a child who is at home due to a forced school closure that directly results from the COVID-19 public health emergency. However, to qualify as a primary caregiver, your provision of care to the child must require such ongoing and constant attention that it is not possible for you to perform your customary work functions at home. For example, if your employer allows you to telework and you are caring for a more mature child who is able to care for him or herself for much of the day, you likely would not qualify for PUA because you are still able to work.Additionally, PUA is available only when a child is home because of a school closure that is a direct result of the COVID-19 public health emergency. A school is not closed as a direct result of the COVID-19 public health emergency after the date the school year was originally scheduled to end. For example, if your child's school closed in May and you had to provide care for them, you may be eligible for PUA in May.However, if your child's school is normally closed in June and July, you would not be eligible for PUA in June or July and should rely on their customary summer arrangements for caring for their children. If, however, you rely on a childcare or other facility to provide summer care for your child and that facility is closed as a direct result of the COVID-19 public health emergency, you may continue to qualify for PUA. Similarly, if there is some other reason under which you qualify for PUA, you will continue to be eligible to receive benefits. <SEP> ​My employer will let me work from home with pay. However, because my children are out of school and my spouse is working, I need to care for them and it is too difficult to work from home. Do I qualify for PUA? <EOS>
Home remedies and therapies are not proven to help alleviate symptoms nor ensure you won't get it.

An antibody test for coronavirus (COVID-19) uses a small blood sample. To get the
               sample, a health professional will:

Clean the skin.
Put an elastic band (tourniquet) above the area to get the veins to swell with
               blood.
Insert a needle into a vein, usually in the arm inside of the elbow or on the
               back of the hand.
Pull the blood sample into a vial or syringe.
Take off the elastic band and remove the needle from the vein.

Sometimes an antibody test can be done with a "fingerstick." The health professional
               will clean the finger, then prick the tip of it with a tiny needle (or lancet) to
               collect the blood. <SEP> How Is Antibody Testing for Coronavirus (COVID-19) Done? <EOS>
Keeping children and staff safe is our utmost priority. As more children return to school, we require new safety standards to set out how schools and early years settings can be adapted to operate safely.
We have published guidance advising schools and early years on reopening to ensure schools can adequately prepare new safety measures to operate safely and minimise the spread of the virus.
Protective measures to reduce transmission include regular hand cleaning, hygiene and cleaning measures, and small consistent group and class sizes of no more than 15 pupils. We have asked schools to consider staggering drop-off and arrival times, break times and assemblies, and make use of outdoor space.
We have also published guidance on face coverings in education institutions that teach people in Years 7 and above. Schools and colleges have the discretion to require face coverings in communal areas where social distancing cannot be safely managed, if they believe that it is right in their particular circumstances. In areas where local restrictions apply, face coverings should be worn by adults and pupils (Years 7 and above) when moving around, such as in corridors and communal areas where social distancing is difficult to maintain. <SEP> 8.2 How will you make sure it is safe? <EOS>

 No. Notification is intended for tests being offered under certain policies in the FDA's Policy for Coronavirus Disease-2019 Tests. In those cases, FDA expects notification from laboratories intending to offer tests they have developed and commercial manufacturers intending to distribute test kits they have developed. FDA does not expect any notification or EUA request from laboratories that are performing testing using EUA-authorized test kits purchased from commercial manufacturers or their distributors. Facilities performing COVID-19 testing must be certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, or CLIA, which is administered by CMS. https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/CLIA/ 
Laboratories authorized to use EUA-authorized tests are subject to various conditions that can be found in the EUA.
Each EUA also includes the settings in which the test is authorized. For ease of reference, the settings authorized in the EUAs are also noted in the EUA table on the EUA page. Tests that are noted with an "H" in the Authorized Settings are limited to use in laboratories certified under CLIA that meet requirements to perform high-complexity tests. Tests that are noted with an "H" and "M" in the Authorized Settings may be performed in laboratories certified under CLIA that meet requirements to perform high complexity and/or moderate complexity tests. Tests that are noted with a "W" in the Authorized Settings are deemed to be CLIA-waived for use in patient care settings operating under a CLIA Certificate of Waiver. Tests noted with an "H," "M," and "W may be used in laboratories certified under CLIA that meet requirements to perform high complexity and/or moderate complexity tests and in patient care settings operating under a CLIA Certificate of Waiver. <SEP>  I am offering COVID-19 testing with an EUA-authorized test kit.

There is currently no known difference between the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 or risk of severe illness or foetal compromise for pregnant and non-pregnant women or adults of reproductive age.  Pregnant and recently pregnant women with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be treated with supportive and management therapies, considering the immunologic and physiologic adaptations during and after pregnancy which may overlap with COVID-19 symptoms.  Data are limited but, until the evidence base provides clearer information, special consideration should be given to pregnant women with concomitant medical illnesses who could be infected with COVID-19. There are no reported deaths in pregnant women at time of publishing this information[17] however, COVID-19 testing of symptomatic pregnant women may need to be prioritized to enable access to specialized care.  All recently pregnant women with COVID-19 or who have recovered from COVID-19 should be provided with information and counselling on safe infant feeding and appropriate IPC measures to prevent COVID-19 virus transmission[18].With confirmed disease or under investigation, management is similar to non-pregnant women, with appropriate isolation of confirmed or under investigation.  Obstetric facilities must be notified and prepared, noting that each infant born to any mother with confirmed COVID-19 should be considered a ‘person under investigation’ and should be isolated according to the IPC guidance.  Currently, it is unknown whether newborns with COVID-19 are at increased risk for severe complications. <SEP> Should pregnant and breastfeeding women living with HIV with COVID-19 and their newborns be managed differently? <EOS>

Outpatient health care settings should devise strategies to identify patients rapidly who might have COVID-19 and take immediate steps to prevent them from potentially infecting others. The following are suggested actions:

Post signage in multiple languages instructing patients to report recent travel and fever or respiratory illness (e.g., cough or shortness of breath). Posters can be downloaded from this Virginia Department of Health webpage.
Also see: CDC Print Resources
Require universal masking at the healthcare facility.
Screen patients for symptoms and fever prior to entering the facility.
Train triage staff to place a face mask (surgical, procedure) on any patient who presents with fever, cough, shortness of breath, chills, muscle pain, sore throat or new onset loss of taste or smell, if they are not already wearing a face covering.
Isolate the patient immediately for additional evaluation. Isolate in a private room with a closed door. Airborne infection isolation rooms should be prioritized for the performance of aerosol generating procedures on confirmed or suspected cases.

• If the patient cannot be evaluated using CDC’s recommended infection prevention and control precautions (see question, “Can people suspected of having COVID-19 be evaluated safely in an outpatient setting?” below), the outpatient practice will need to arrange referral and transport of the masked patient to a setting where this can be done.

As of March 2020, there is no specific medication that is approved to treat COVID-19. Pharmaceutical companies and research organizations are conducting trials of antiviral drugs to treat the disease. However, it is unlikely that a drug will be available for human use before the end of 2020. 

Several organizations are also working on developing a potential vaccine for the disease. However, it's not known when a vaccine would be available to the public.

In the course of conducting a food inspection, food inspectors routinely wear protective equipment. There is no need for additional protective equipment to be used. The primary focus of the additional hygiene and sanitation measures implemented by food businesses should be on keeping the COVID-19 out of their businesses. COVID-19 virus will only enter business premises when an infected person enters, or contaminated fomites are brought into the premises. Food safety authorities should consider reducing the frequency of food inspections during this pandemic. If food inspectors continue to carry out food inspections, they will need to demonstrate that they are free from infection, they will need to practice physical distancing while in the food premises, changing clothes/shoes between inspections, washing hands before and after entering the food premises and good coughing/sneezing etiquette. <SEP> Do food inspectors need to wear any protective equipment? <EOS>
Eviction Protection and Assistance
Your landlord cannot remove you from your home during this emergency. This moratorium on evictions will remain in place for up to two months after the end of this emergency.
On March 19, 2020, Governor Murphy issued Executive Order No. 106, which states that any lessee, tenant, homeowner or any other person shall not be removed from a residential property as the result of an eviction or foreclosure proceeding.
If you are at risk of eviction or are concerned about paying rent, use this online eviction moratorium information and question tool to see your rights and what assistance programs are available.
If you are facing eviction or foreclosure, contact a housing counselor immediately through this online directory or by calling 1-800-NJ-HOUSE.
Counseling is free, available now, and can be provided remotely to help homeowners avoid potential foreclosure. At the same time, the counseling made available to renters will guide them on how to approach discussions with their landlords on dealing with their rent situation.
Legal Action
In addition to the resources above, you can file a special civil case as an emergent matter if you are a tenant and 1) you have been locked out by your landlord without a court order; 2) you have had your utilities turned off or otherwise not able to live in your rental home; or 3) you need access to your personal property and/or have had your personal property taken by your landlord.
Use the Illegal Lockout packet and email it to the emergent filing mailbox for your county (click here for a directory). Your local court ombudsman is available to answer any questions you might have.
You can also access free legal assistance through Legal Services of New Jersey (LSNJ). Learn more by visiting their site, or get advice, referrals, and information through their hotline by calling 1-888-LSNJ-LAW (1-888-576-5529) or by visiting www.LSNJLawHotline.org.
Additional Rent Relief Programs
Governor Murphy has announced an executive order allowing renters to direct their landlords to use their security deposits to pay their rents, whether that be to make up for a shortfall or to pay it in full.
Tenants will not be obligated to make any further security deposit relating to their current lease agreement but would still be responsible for any monies landlords expend that would have been reimbursable via the security deposit as outlined in the original contract (i.e. damage to the property).
However, should the tenant and landlord extend or renew their lease, then the tenant would be obligated to replenish the security deposit in full either six months following the end of the Public Health Emergency, or on the date on which the current lease agreement is extended or renewed, whichever is later. The order will be in place until 60 days after the public health emergency is terminated.
The New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Financing Authority has authorized an emergency grant funding program for the owners of small rental apartment buildings to help cover their COVID-19-related rent losses from April through July. Landlords who receive assistance must pass along the benefits to their tenants by forgiving outstanding back rent and late fees accumulated during this period. Click here to learn more about the Small Landlord Emergency Grant Program.
In addition, the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Financing Authority (NJHMFA) has suspended all rent increases at all eligible properties within its portfolio, which includes 36,000 rental units across the state for low-and-middle income New Jerseyans.
For more information, contact one of NJHMFA's housing counselors. Click here for a list of available counselors in your county or call 1-800-NJ-HOUSE.

The American Academy of Pediatrics and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend at least 60 minutes of vigorous physical activity per day for our youngsters. However, you can break that time up during the day, which may help even more. Taking short active breaks throughout the day with short bursts can be less daunting and help with kids’ focus and attention for other tasks, such as online learning during this time. Taking a break to have a 15-20 minute dance party, helping to perform higher intensity chores like deep cleaning the basement, gardening in the backyard, or taking a family walk in the neighborhood (with your mask) can all be activities that help achieve the recommended daily goal. <SEP> Break things up <EOS>
The most widely used antimalarial treatments, artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), are produced using the pure artemisinin compound extracted from the plant Artemisia annua. There have been reports that products or extracts (e.g. herbal teas or tablets) made from Artemisia plant material may have a preventive or curative effect on COVID-19. However, available in vitro data suggests that purified artemisinin compounds or A. annua plant product or extracts do not have an appreciable effect against COVID-19 at concentrations that could be safely achieved in humans. As such, current evidence does not support the use of artemisinins or A. annua products or extracts as an antiviral for COVID-19. WHO urges extreme caution over reports touting the efficacy of such products. As explained in a WHO position statement, there is no scientific evidence base to support the use of non-pharmaceutical forms of Artemisia for the prevention or treatment of malaria. There is also no evidence to suggest that COVID-19 can be prevented or treated with products made from Artemisia-based plant material. <SEP> What is WHO’s position on the use of Artemisia plant material for the prevention or treatment of malaria and/or COVID-19? <EOS>
Probably not. If you are practicing social distancing and making only occasional trips to the grocery store or pharmacy, experts say that it’s not necessary to change clothes or take a shower when you return home. You should, however, always wash your hands upon entering your home.

If you are in danger, call the National Domestic Violence Hotline: 1-800-799-7233. 
This is a problem that is affecting people across the world. Since the pandemic started, abusers and their families are often stuck in the same house, and tensions are running high. Doctors and advocates for victims are seeing signs of an increase in violence at home. They are hearing accounts of people lashing out, particularly at women and children.
“No one can leave,” said Kim Foxx, the chief prosecutor in Chicago. “You’re literally mandating that people who probably should not be together in the same space stay.”
Across the country, hotlines are seeing increased traffic, with calls and text messages mounting. But in many places, reports are dropping. That’s not because abuse is falling, officials say. Instead, it’s because people are having a harder time reporting. Reports of child abuse cases are falling, which is also worrisome.

The virus is new, and much is being learned about it. Current evidence suggests that it may remain for hours to days on surfaces made from a variety of materials. Cleaning of visibly dirty surfaces followed by disinfection with EPA-approved disinfectants is a best practice measure for prevention of COVID-19 and other viral respiratory illnesses in households and community settings.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks. If surfaces are dirty, clean them using detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection. To disinfect, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants will work. See the CDC’s recommendations for household cleaning and disinfection. <SEP> How long does the COVID-19 virus live on surfaces? <EOS>
Plasma is, basically, the liquid part of your blood: it’s light yellow and about 92 percent water. Any antibodies that your body creates are contained in the plasma. Once you’ve recovered, or convalesced, from a given virus, those antibodies stick around in your plasma for a certain amount of time, ready to fight that virus if it comes back.
If you have antibodies, your convalescent plasma can be transfused into a patient still battling the disease. 
To qualify, donors must pass normal blood-donation requirements and be symptom-free of Covid-19 for at least 14 days, and, in most cases, must have positive results from a test. (Other restrictions may apply, depending on the organization.)

Patients who have tested positive for COVID-19 may be supported from home by a team of Penn Medicine doctors and nurses using two remote monitoring programs.
These remote monitoring programs are used by patients with the virus who are well enough to recover from home after they’ve been discharged from Penn Medicine emergency departments and hospitals, as well as patients who are confirmed or likely to have COVID-19 but not sick enough to need hospitalization.
COVID Watch is an automated text messaging system that provides 24/7 clinical feedback and support. Patients enrolled in the program receive check-in messages every morning and afternoon. At any time, patients can also text the word “worse” to receive a call from a Penn Medicine clinician within 1 hour.
COVID Pulse is a program that allows patients to monitor their oxygen levels at home with a pulse oximeter device, also known as a “pulse ox.” This device measures oxygen levels to help Penn Medicine clinicians know how much oxygen is in the patient’s blood. <SEP> How are patients with COVID-19 monitored at home? <EOS>
Asymptomatic describes a person who is infected but does not have symptoms. With Covid-19, asymptomatic carriers can still easily infect others without knowing it. So if you’re infected but don’t feel sick, you could still get others very sick. 
Some medical professionals differentiate between truly asymptomatic carriers – those who don’t currently have and will never have symptoms – from “pre-symptomatic” carriers – those who don’t have symptoms now, but will get them later. But the general public often uses the term “asymptomatic” to describe both categories of infected people.
Regardless of which term you use, researchers have found that about half of coronavirus transmissions happen between people who don’t have any symptoms. And in some cases, people are more contagious before they start showing symptoms. <SEP> What does asymptomatic mean? <EOS>

There was a recent study on this practice in China published in The Lancet. There are standards that must be followed around flows of patients and staff to reduce the risk of patient cross-infection or healthcare workers becoming infected. Design issues are very important.
Preparing staff to work in these temporary hospitals —with special attention to their mental health—is essential. In New York, after 9/11, as serious as the health impacts of the dust cloud were, the mental health impacts were even larger. Limiting exposure to traumatic situations and providing time off and counseling are important design considerations, particularly for people who haven't been trained to deal with these kinds of emergencies.

Recommendations for how long people should quarantine or isolate change often and
               can vary depending on where you live. For the latest updates, visit your local health
               department's website or the Centers
               for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website.
In general, a person should:

Quarantine for 14 days (2 weeks) after contact with an infected
               person or after arriving home from traveling. They should watch for symptoms, which
               can show up 2 to 14 days after exposure to the virus.or
Isolate for 10 days from the time their COVID-19 symptoms started,
               or from the date they tested positive. They can stop isolating 10 days after the start
               of their symptoms (or their positive test), as long as they've had 1 full day without
               a fever and their other symptoms have gotten better. If testing is easy to get, a
               health care provider may choose to send a person for two separate tests at least 24
               hours apart. If both are negative, the person can stop isolating.

Someone who starts to feel sick during a 2-week quarantine should switch to isolation
               and add 10 more days. If they start to feel sick near the end of their quarantine
               period, it could mean staying at home for as long as 24 days. This can be very hard,
               but it is very important to do so to prevent spreading the virus to others.
A person in quarantine or isolation should work with their doctor and their local
               health department to make sure they follow the most current guidelines. <SEP> How Long Should Quarantine or Isolation Last? <EOS>
All of the considerations described above apply to malaria-eliminating countries and those preventing re-establishment of the disease: efforts must be sustained to prevent, detect and treat malaria cases while preventing the spread of COVID-19 and ensuring the safety of those who deliver the services. Countries that are nearing malaria elimination must protect their important gains and avoid malaria resurgences. Countries that have eliminated malaria must remain vigilant for any imported cases of malaria that may be occurring to prevent reintroduction of the disease. <SEP> What are the key considerations for countries that are working to eliminate malaria or prevent re-establishment of transmission? <EOS>
 The Board of Regents approved an emergency  regulation that allows the Department to excuse the requirement for speech language  pathology and audiology to be provided on a continuous basis if such  continuous experience cannot be completed during the State of  Emergency declared by Governor Cuomo in Executive Order 202 relating to the COVID-19 health crisis. For  the duration of the current state of emergency, the requirement that supervised  experience be obtained on a “continuous” basis has been suspended. You can resume your supervised experience  where you left off before it was interrupted by COVID-19. <SEP> What  if I cannot complete my pre-license supervised experience? <EOS>
Isolation and quarantine sites are available to provide isolation and quarantine assistance to help residents who are not able to isolate and recovery in their own home. Examples of people who may need this assistance include people who cannot safely isolate from a family member who is elderly or medically fragile, or people experiencing homelessness.

Pooling—sometimes referred to as pool testing, pooled testing, or batch testing—means combining respiratory samples from several people and conducting one laboratory test on the combined pool of samples to detect SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
Pooling allows laboratories to test more samples with fewer testing materials. It could be useful in scenarios like returning groups of workers to a workplace.
Laboratories certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) can use a specimen pooling strategy to expand SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid diagnostic or screening testing capacity when using a test authorized for such use by FDA. Non-CLIA-Certified Laboratories can use a specimen pooling strategy for surveillance testing. <SEP> What is pooling and why is it used? <EOS>
People age 60 and over, and those with serious chronic diseases of underlying health conditions, should postpone or delay travel internationally to and from areas with community transmission, where there are many cases of COVID-19.  This is because people in the high-risk group more frequently get very sick after getting the disease, with some dying of it. If you have to travel in these circumstances, you should wear a medical  mask for more protection against the virus. However, masks do not mean you are fully protected. You should also clean your hands frequently, cough or sneeze into a bent elbow or tissue, and maintain a distance of at least 1 metre from others wherever possible. <SEP> If I feel well but am in the high-risk category, should I travel? <EOS>

Organized Sports
Organized sports activities have restarted in stages.
Low-risk, non-contact sports, such as golf and tennis, can resume practices and competitions, indoors and outdoors.
Medium- and high-risk sports, including baseball, softball, soccer, basketball, and football can resume contact practices and competitions in outdoor settings only. Non-contact practices and drills can resume in both indoor and outdoor settings.
The Department of Health has issued guidance for organized sports with further details on which sports are defined in which category, how to create a sports program preparation plan, how to prepare a facility for sports practices, how to conduct sports practices, and how to prepare for games and tournaments.
All sports will have to abide by a number of health and safety protocols in the guidance, including screenings for athletes, coaches, and staff, limited equipment sharing, and strong requirements for disinfecting and sanitizing equipment.
Staff, parents, guardians, and visitors are required to wear cloth face coverings at practices and games. Athletes are encouraged to wear masks during downtime, but not during physical activity.
All competitions or tournaments must abide by the limit on outdoor gatherings, which is currently limited to 500 people.
Fall School Sports Season
Sports under the jurisdiction of the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association (NJSIAA) or the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) must also abide by those associations' rules.
The final determination on the fall high school sports seasons will be made by the NJSIAA, and school districts will make the ultimate decision on whether teams will resume competition.
A student-athlete's ability to participate with their team will not be altered in any way - regardless of whether they participate in remote-learning or in-person instruction.
Note: A new law waives the requirement to complete an annual pre-participation physical examination for any student-athlete enrolled in grade six to 12 who either completed a physical examination during the 2019-2020 school year or completed a physical examination that allowed the student to participate on a school-sponsored interscholastic or intramural athletic team or squad during the 2019-2020 school year.
A student-athlete who has not completed a physical examination within 365 days prior to the first day of official practice in the athletic season is permitted to participate on a school-sponsored athletic team provided they complete the physical examination before the end of the athletic season.
Professional Sports
Professional sports teams which train or play in New Jersey can practice and engage in games or matches, if their leagues resume competition.
The State has been in constant discussions with these teams about the protocols they will have in place to protect the health and safety of the players, coaches, and team personnel - including facilities where proper sanitation and hygiene practices can be readily maintained.

The two main types of tests for coronavirus look for either a current infection
               or a past infection.
To check if someone is infected with coronavirus, health care providers look for
               pieces of the virus in a sample of saliva (spit)
               or mucus. These tests can tell if the person is infected on the day of the
               test.
Health care providers can:

Use a long swab (like a Q-tip) to take a sample from inside the nose (at the start
               of the nostrils, the middle of the nose, or the very back of the nose), the throat,
               the inside of the cheeks, or along the gums or tongue.
Give the person a container to spit or cough into.

People can get the test in a doctor's office or other testing sites (such as pharmacies
               or pop-up sites). Some areas offer drive-thru
               testing, which lets people stay in their car during the test. At some testing
               sites, people can swab themselves following directions from the health care team.
               There also are special kits that families can order to do the test at home.
Depending on the type of test and where it was done, results can be ready that
               day or take a week or longer if the test went to a lab. Currently, home kits always
               go to a lab. Results might take longer if a community does many tests at the same
               time.
A "positive" test means a person is infected with coronavirus, and a "negative"
               test means they aren't infected. But sometimes the test results aren't accurate. A
               test result can be negative even when someone has the virus. This is why some people
               get a second test. Rarely, the test may be positive in someone who doesn't have the
               virus.
Inaccurate test results are more likely when someone is tested very early or very
               late in their infection. They tend to be more accurate when done a few days after
               someone was around an infected person or symptoms started.
Before the test, make sure you understand the instructions. For a swab test, help
               your child stay still so the health care provider can get a good sample. The better
               the sample, the more accurate the results.
To see if someone had coronavirus in the past, health care providers look for antibodies, which the body
               makes after an infection. It can tell if someone had an infection in the past, at
               least 2–3 weeks before the test. That's how long it takes the body to make antibodies
               after infection. It can't tell if the person is infected at the time of the
               test, which is why this test isn't used to diagnose COVID-19.
This is a blood test, with a sample taken either from a vein or a fingertip (called
               a "fingerstick"). Results can be ready on the same day, or up to a week later. There's
               no home kit for antibody testing yet.
Health experts aren't sure whether antibodies protect a person from future coronavirus
               infections. And if they do, it's not clear for how long. <SEP> What Are the Types of Coronavirus (COVID-19) Tests? <EOS>

Ventilation is an important factor in preventing the virus that causes COVID-19 from spreading indoors.  Below are steps to consider which can improve indoor ventilation. These steps should be considered in consultation with a heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) professional.Consider using natural ventilation, opening windows if possible and safe to do so.For mechanical systems, increase the percentage of outdoor air, using economizer modes of HVAC operations and potentially as high as 100%. Before increasing outdoor air percentage, verify compatibility with HVAC system capabilities for both temperature and humidity control as well as compatibility with outdoor/indoor air quality considerations.Increase total airflow supply to occupied spaces, if possible.Disable demand-control ventilation controls that reduce air supply based on temperature or occupancy.Improve central air filtration:Increase air filtration to as high as possible without significantly diminishing design airflow.Inspect filter housing and racks to ensure appropriate filter fit and check for ways to minimize filter bypass.Consider running the HVAC system at maximum outside airflow for 2 hours before and after spaces are occupied, in accordance with manufactory recommendations.Generate clean-to-less-clean air movements by re-evaluating the positioning of supply and exhaust air diffusers and/or dampers and adjusting zone supply and exhaust flow rates to establish measurable pressure differentials. Have staff work in “clean” ventilation zones that do not include higher-risk areas such as visitor reception or exercise facilities (if open).Ensure exhaust fans in restroom facilities are functional and operating at full capacity when the building is occupied. <SEP> What steps can be undertaken to improve the ventilation in indoor public spaces and buildings? <EOS>
Vitamin D is among the many medications being studied in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.

CDC’s guidance for Considerations for Selecting Protective Clothing used in Healthcare for Protection against Microorganisms in Blood and Body Fluids outlines the scientific evidence and information on national and international standards, test methods, and specifications for fluid-resistant and impermeable gowns and coveralls used in healthcare.
Many organizations have published guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) in medical settings. The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the Association of the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI): ANSI/AAMI PB70:2012pdf iconexternal icon describes the liquid barrier performance and a classification of surgical and isolation gowns for use in health care facilities.
As with any type of PPE, the key to proper selection and use of protective clothing is to understand the hazards and the risk of exposure. Some of the factors important to assessing the risk of exposure in health facilities include source, modes of transmission, pressures and types of contact, and duration and type of tasks to be performed by the user of the PPE. (Technical Information Report (TIR) 11pdf iconexternal icon[AAMI 2005]).

Micro Business Loan Program (Application Deadline Passed): Through this program, the NJEDA makes financing of up to $50,000 available to New Jersey businesses, which can use the financing for working capital or to purchase equipment. To ensure that the financing is accessible to the early-stage and micro businesses that need it most, to qualify, a business must fewer than ten employees and no greater than $1.5 million in revenues. On June, 9, NJEDA announced an expansion of its Micro Business Loan Program to assist New Jersey small businesses, many of which are facing business interruption as a result of COVID-19.
The expanded program will provide financing up to $50,000 to businesses for inventory, equipment, and working capital. Loans will have a standard ten-year term. Interest rates will be set at 2 percent with no interest and no payment due for the first three years. Businesses that receive financing under the enhanced program and are still in operation 12 months after the closing date of the loan will have ten percent of the approved loan amount forgiven.
The expanded Micro Business Loan Program is open to for-profit businesses with a business location in New Jersey, as well as home-based businesses and not-for-profit organizations that have been in operation for at least two years. Startup businesses, defined under the program as business in operation between six months and one year, may also be eligible for the program, but will be required to provide a business plan and five-year projections at application. The NJEDA will capitalize the program with $10 million. Of the $10 million in total funding available, $3.5 million will be set aside to support eligible entities located in New Jersey Opportunity Zone-eligible census tracts.
Small Business Fund - The Small Business Fund offers loans of up to $500,000 for qualifying creditworthy small, minority- or women-owned businesses in New Jersey with up to $3 million in revenue that have been in operation for at least one full year and may not have the ability to get bank financing. Not-for-profit corporations that have been operating for at least three full years may also be eligible for assistance under the Small Business Fund.
Direct Loans - Direct loans are available up to $2 million for fixed assets, and $750,000 for working capital. New Jersey businesses in need of financing and committed to job creation/retention may be eligible for direct loans through the EDA when conventional financing is not available. EDA's direct loan financing offers competitive interest rates and terms.
Premier Lender Program - In partnership with two dozen banks throughout New Jersey, The Premier Lender Program offers up to a $2 million loan participation or $1.5 million loan guarantee for fixed assets, and up to a $750,000 loan participation or $1.5 million guarantee for term working capital. Line of credit guarantees of up to $750,000 are also available.

These decisions should be made with local public health officials. With respect to COVID-19 specifically, the Department of Health and Human Service’s Office for Civil Rights advises that only the “minimum necessary” information be disclosed to the public. Certain communities in the State of New Jersey, for example, have released only patient age, gender, current location (hospital vs. home), virus contraction date, and whether it was contracted from a known individual. However, depending on the situation, health officials may have reasons to release more information to help people protect themselves. For example, if a case went to a funeral during an infectious period, making an announcement instructing what people who were at the funeral should do might well be appropriate.

To ensure continuity of operations, CDC advises that critical infrastructure workers may be permitted to continue work following potential exposure to COVID-19, informed by the risk assessment of the workplace that accounts for COVID-19 mitigations already in place, provided they remain symptom-free and additional precautions are taken to protect them and the community.
Sick workers should stay home or go home if they develop symptoms during the work day.
For workers potentially exposed to someone with COVID-19, employers should
Check temperatures and assess symptoms of workers, ideally before entering the facility or operation.
If no fever (>100.4 F) or COVID-19 symptoms are present, workers should self-monitor for onset of symptoms during their shift.
As a general good practice for all workers, employers should
Encourage workers to use an employer-approved face mask or cloth face covering at all times while in the workplace. 
Ensure that workers can practice social distancing or employ engineering solutions if that is not possible.  
Make available facilities and materials for worker hygiene so workers can practice CDC recommended handwashing. 
Clean and disinfect workplaces/stations at frequent intervals.

Paid COVID-19 Leave is limited to a single leave bank of 80 hours of paid leave (pro-rated for part-time employees), that has three types of uses: School Leave, Health Leave, and Care Leave. Employees do not receive 80 hours of leave for each type of Paid COVID-19 Leave use. Additionally, each type of Paid-COVID-19 Leave is subject to the following time and pay limitations:

School Leave is compensated at 2/3 pay, up to a daily cap of $200. Employees are permitted to supplement with accrued vacation leave or compensatory time so they receive their normal salary.
Health Leave is compensated at 100% pay, up to a daily cap of $511. Employees are permitted to supplement with accrued sick leave for sick leave qualifying conditions, accrued vacation leave, or accrued compensatory time so they receive their normal salary.
Care Leave is compensated at 2/3 pay, up to a daily cap of $200. Employees are permitted to supplement with accrued sick leave for reasons that qualify for use of sick leave to care for sick family members under MS 181.4319, accrued vacation leave, or accrued compensatory time so they receive their normal salary. 

EFMLA leave is limited to up to 12 workweeks of leave. The first 2 workweeks of EFMLA leave are unpaid, but can be supplemented with Paid COVID-19 Leave (School Leave) to the extent available, accrued vacation leave, or accrued compensatory time.

Governor Murphy has signed an executive order extending the grace period for residents unable to pay their insurance premiums because of a loss of income or other negative impact as a result of the COVID-19 emergency.
The Governor's order:

Extends minimum grace periods: A minimum 60-day grace period will be required for health and dental insurance policies, and a minimum 90-day grace period will be required for life insurance, insurance premium-financing arrangements, and property and casualty insurance, which includes auto, homeowners, and renters insurance. Insurance companies will be required to notify policyholders of this emergency grace period and to waive certain late fees, interest, or other charges associated with delays in premium payments as directed by the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance.
Requires insurance companies to pay claims during the grace period: Insurance companies will be required to pay any claim incurred during the emergency grace period that would be covered under the policy. The Order further prohibits insurance companies from seeking recoupment of any claims paid during the emergency grace period based on non-payment of premiums.
Ensures that unpaid premiums are made payable over a lengthy period: To ensure that policyholders are not required to make a lump sum payment on unpaid premiums at the end of the grace period, any unpaid premium will be amortized over the remainder of the policy term or a period of up to 12 months, as appropriate and as directed by the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance.
Requires insurers to provide each policyholder with an easily readable written description of the terms of the extended grace period.

What I have learned studying leaders is that it's very important to take deft, mindful opportunities to address people's fears. You want to display your humanity, and you want them to relate to you, but how can you do that without becoming so vulnerable that people lose confidence in you? That's the fine line you’re walking.
Think of Franklin Roosevelt's first inaugural address: “We have nothing to fear but fear itself.” You can address and acknowledge their fears, but you don't want to share too many of your own. Remember, your job as a leader is to help them “do harder, better things than they can get themselves to do on their own,” to help them navigate that inner uncertainty. (Nancy Koehn, 4/29/20)
You have to be brutally honest and still offer a rational basis for hope, with an emphasis on the latter. You also have to show empathy, but empathy doesn't mean that you dissolve in tears and say, “I don’t know what we're going to do. I don't know how we're going to make our way through this.” Ernest Shackleton never shamed anyone for weakness or their inability to do something. He ordered a round of warm milk for everybody.

Blood Drives
Blood drives can continue to operate in New Jersey. The CDC encourages people who are well to continue to donate blood if they are able, even if they are practicing social distancing because of COVID-19.
The State has issued an administrative order permitting the continued operation of blood drives to meet the critical needs of residents. Blood drives must continue to take appropriate measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19, including the following:

incorporating social distancing where practicable
collecting blood only from individuals who are healthy and feeling well at the time of donation
conducting temperature screens of both staff and donors before entering a blood drive
requiring the use of PPE
providing hand sanitizer to donors for use before the drive and during the donation process
frequently sanitizing equipment and work spaces.

If you would like to donate blood, contact one of the following organizations:
New Jersey Red Cross
New York Blood Center
Miller-Keystone Blood Center
Vitalant
If you don't feel well on the day of your scheduled appointment, please cancel your donation.
Plasma Donations
Blood plasma from those who have recovered from COVID-19 may help treat patients who are severely ill with the virus. The blood plasma from recovered patients contains antibodies that may help critically ill patients fight the virus. Historically, convalescent plasma has been used as a potentially life-saving treatment in situations when new diseases or infections develop quickly, and no treatments or vaccines were available yet.
Eligible individuals must be fully recovered from COVID-19 and symptom free, and must otherwise meet regular blood donation eligibility criteria. Individuals are encouraged to register to donate at RedCrossBlood.org/plasma4covid. Once registered, someone will follow up to qualify the potential donor, and once qualified, the donor will receive an appointment time and location to donate. Please note that plasma collection is by appointment only.
American Red Cross convalescent plasma collection sites will begin collection at the American Red Cross blood center in Fairfield and University Hospital in Newark on Monday, May 11.
In late March, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced a new initiative to collect plasma from those who have recovered from novel coronavirus to treat patients with serious or immediately life-threatening COVID-19 infections. University Hospital is one of the first hospitals in the state to receive the FDA approval for convalescent plasma treatment in New Jersey and remains one of only a few hospitals in the state offering this treatment. Approximately 100 COVID-19 patients at University Hospital have been treated with convalescent plasma. The effectiveness of this treatment is not yet known – but many patients that have received this therapy at University Hospital have recovered, which is a promising sign. University Hospital practitioners and researchers, along with others across the country, continue to monitor and investigate the progress of COVID-19 patients who receive this treatment.
Other New Jersey hospitals can register to participate in the FDA's program to access convalescent plasma and with the Red Cross to access plasma here: https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/dlp/plasma-donations-from-recovered-covid-19-patients/clinician-registration.html

Not really. Gloves become a second skin. They themselves could become contaminated (don’t touch your face!) and depending on how they’re made, they might have holes. 
Gloves may be helpful if someone in your household becomes sick, so you can reduce the amount of times you have to wash your hands. But you will have to change the gloves every time you leave their room or interact with the sick person.

Herd immunity occurs when enough people become immune to a disease to make its spread unlikely. As a result, the entire community is protected, even those who are not themselves immune. Herd immunity is usually achieved through vaccination, but it can also occur through natural infection.Based on what we know about the contagiousness of the COVID-19 virus, experts estimate that somewhere between 60% and 70% of the population needs to be immune in order to achieve herd immunity. That's close to 200 million people in the United States, and nearly five billion people worldwide. (As of now, we are nowhere close to the numbers needed to achieve herd immunity.)Achieving herd immunity through natural infection means many people would become ill and many would die. These risks may fall as we develop effective treatments. However, we still don't know how long people who recover from COVID-19 will remain immune to reinfection.Ideally, we will achieve herd immunity through a safe vaccine (or vaccines) that will confer lasting immunity. <SEP> What is herd immunity, and could it play a role in stopping the spread of COVID-19? <EOS>

Law enforcement agencies should encourage all personnel to self-monitor for symptoms before they come to work. Workers who have symptoms (fever, cough, or shortness of breath) should notify their supervisor and stay home. They can also enter their symptoms into the CDC Self-Checker to determine whether they need to seek medical care. Law enforcement agencies should ensure that sick leave policies are flexible and consistent with public health guidance, and that employees are aware of and understand these policies. <SEP> Should law enforcement agencies screen personnel for signs and symptoms of COVID-19? <EOS>
The State chose dynamic data models that take into account what we are seeing on the ground at a local level. New Jersey uses an ensemble of models which allow us to:

Capture trends at a zip code granularity not captured by most other models
Capture both short-term and long-term trends
Consistently show errors less than 1-2% on a daily basis over short-term forecasts in many of our models
Model "stay at home" dynamics that are tailored to the social distancing dynamics of a given geography

With the situation constantly changing, the State is careful to take nothing for granted and update our models daily with the latest information on confirmed cases and deaths by county, as well as hospitalization rates and discharges for every facility. <SEP> Are the data models the State is using accurate? How do they account for all the day-to-day changes? <EOS>
 The terms "serological" or "antibody" tests are generally used to refer to tests that detect antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Because the antibodies are part of the body's immune response to exposure and not the virus itself, such testing cannot be used for diagnosis of infection. Based on the underlying scientific principles of antibody tests, we do not expect that an antibody test can be shown to definitively diagnose or exclude COVID-19 infection. SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests are intended for use as an aid in identifying individuals with an adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2, indicating recent or prior infection, by detecting antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in human blood specimens.
As stated in the Policy for Coronavirus Disease-2019 Tests, validated antibody tests offered under the policy in that guidance should, among other things, include in instructions for use and test reports information to convey that negative results do not preclude acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and that, if acute infection is suspected, direct testing for SARS-CoV-2 is necessary. SARS-CoV-2 serology tests should be ordered only by clinicians who are familiar with the use and limitations of the test. <SEP>  Are antibody, or serology, tests used to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection?

The best technique is to apply about a dime-sized amount, and then carefully and thoroughly rub it over the palms and the back of the hands and let it dry completely. Hand sanitizer is a good way to reduce the possibility of transmission if soap and water is not available (and if kids have a hard time washing their hands properly), but hand-washing for at least 20 seconds is overall the most effective way to get rid of viruses.

Most people who are infected with the COVID-19 virus produce antibodies, which are proteins that make it harder for the virus to infect cells. But antibodies are only one part of the body's immune response. T cells, for example, can destroy cells that are already infected. And memory B cells can quickly generate a strong antibody response to a virus the body has encountered before.Antibody levels typically fall once the immediate threat of infection declines. Several new studies have found that COVID-19 antibody levels decline, but then stabilize and remain in the blood even two to three months after infection. Other recent studies found COVID-specific B cells and T cells in the blood, months after people recovered. This all suggests that the immune system would be ready to react quickly and strongly if re-exposed to the COVID-19 virus.The laboratory evidence is promising. But the real evidence will come as more and more people who have recovered (rather than cells in a lab) are re-exposed to the virus.Researchers in Hong Kong recently reported the first confirmed case of reinfection with the COVID-19 virus. The man was first infected in March, then declared to be recovered after two negative coronavirus tests. Four and a half months later, he tested positive for coronavirus on a saliva screening test administered at the Hong Kong airport upon his return from a trip to Europe. Scientists sequenced viral genetic material from the man's two infections and found significant enough differences to suggest two separate infections.The man had experienced mild symptoms during his first infection and had no symptoms the second time he was infected. It's possible that while his immune system could not protect him against reinfection, it did help keep him from getting sicker during the second infection.It's far too early to make any generalizations. We cannot know from one case of reinfection (among tens of millions of people who have been infected) how strong an average immune response will be, or how long that immune response will last.It's also worth noting that someone who has been re-infected — even someone with no symptoms — has the potential to spread the virus to others. That means that everyone, even those who have recovered from coronavirus infection, should continue to wear masks and practice physical distancing. <SEP> Is a person who has been infected with coronavirus protected from becoming infected again? <EOS>

Under federal law, you are entitled to a safe workplace. Your employer must provide a workplace free of known health  and safety hazards. If you have concerns, you have the right to speak up about them without fear of retaliation.
If you believe you are being  exposed to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, or that your employer is  not taking appropriate steps to protect you from exposure to the virus at work, talk to your supervisor or employer about your concerns. OSHA provides recommendations for measures workers and employers can take to  prevent exposures and infections.
You have the right to file a complaint if you  feel you are being exposed to a serious health or safety hazard. If you have suffered retaliation because you voiced concerns about a health or safety  hazard, you have the right to file a whistleblower protection complaint.
If you believe you have contracted COVID-19 on the job, OSHA recommends several steps you should take, including notifying your  supervisor. Your employer can take actions that will keep others in your workplace  healthy and may be able to offer you leave flexibilities while you are away from  work.

The diagnostic methods for tuberculosis (TB) and COVID-19 are quite distinct and commonly require different specimens.  Sputum, as well as many other biological specimens, can be used to diagnose TB using culture or molecular techniques.Tests for COVID-19 are done most commonly by nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab or wash in ambulatory patients, but sputum or endotracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage may be used in patients with severe respiratory disease.  Molecular testing is the currently recommended method for the identification of infectious COVID-19 and just as for TB, serological assays are not recommended for the routine diagnosis of COVID-19.The pipeline for COVID-19 diagnostics has flourished impressively within a few months. Amongst these is the Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 cartridge for use on GeneXpert machines, which are machines used in TB diagnosis. WHO is currently evaluating this cartridge as well as other tests. Additional resources to roll out COVID-19 testing should be mobilized rather than relying only on existing resources that are used for TB, to ensure that the diagnostic coverage for TB is maintained as necessary. <SEP> Can tuberculosis and COVID-19 be tested on the same type of specimen? <EOS>
There is no defined list of recognized medical, mental health conditions or disabilities that would prevent someone from wearing a face covering. Even if there was, there can be individual variation in tolerance for wearing a face covering among people with the same condition–one person might tolerate a face covering and another might not.
Face coverings can also pose special challenges for people who are deaf or hard of hearing or have other communication needs or disabilities. The Executive Order not only provides exemptions for people who are unable to wear a face covering due to a medical or mental health condition or disability, but also allows people without such conditions to temporarily remove their face covering while communicating with someone who is deaf or hard of hearing or who has a condition or disability that makes communication with that individual while wearing a face covering difficult.

The best way to prevent illness among people who are incarcerated is to prevent exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19. Start by:

Staying informed about updates to CDC guidance via the CDC COVID-19 website.
Making sure people who are incarcerated are aware of COVID-19 symptoms and remind them to notify staff right away if they might be sick.
Posting information about and ensuring they use everyday preventive actions (such as washing hands, avoiding touching their eyes, nose, and mouth, covering their cough).
Stocking up and providing free access to soap (preferably liquid soap to promote use), tissues, and hand drying supplies, as well as hand sanitizer (where permitted based on security restrictions).
Conducting temperature checks and screening all new entrants, staff, and visitors for flu-like symptoms during the last 24 hours, and any contact they may have had with someone infected with COVID-19 in the last 14 days.
Offering flu shots to people who are incarcerated, as limiting cases of flu can help speed the identification of people with COVID-19.

We don't know for certain if the COVID-19 virus spreads through air conditioning. But we do know that when it's hot and humid, people are more likely to stay indoors, with the windows closed — giving the virus more opportunity to spread.Coronavirus spreads through droplets that an infected person emits through coughs or sneezes and through smaller, infectious viral particles that can drift around in the air for several hours. Outdoors, air currents can scatter and dilute the virus, making transmission less likely. You're more likely to inhale the virus indoors, with the windows closed, whether or not you have the air conditioning on.If you must be indoors with anyone outside of your household, increase air circulation by keeping the windows open as much as possible. <SEP> Can the COVID-19 virus spread through air conditioning? <EOS>
 There is no reason at this time to think that any animals, including pets, in the United States might be a source of infection with this new coronavirus that causes COVID-19. The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, and talking. Recent studies show that people who are infected but do not have symptoms likely also play a role in the spread of COVID-19. At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. Based on the information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. <SEP>  Can I get COVID-19 from my pet or other animals? <EOS>

At this time, there are no reliable data to support claims that the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may contribute to poorer outcomes in persons with COVID-19. Additionally, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) released a statement that: Currently there are no experimental or clinical data demonstrating beneficial or adverse outcomes with background use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) or other renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) antagonists in COVID-19 or among COVID-19 patients with a history of cardiovascular disease treated with such agents. The Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA), ACC, and American Heart Association (AHA) recommend continuation of RAAS antagonists for those patients who are currently prescribed such agents for indications for which these agents are known to be beneficial, such as heart failure, hypertension, or ischemic heart disease. <SEP> Should individuals with COVID-19-like illness avoid NSAIDs or ACE inhibitors? <EOS>

A. The capability to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 serology (antibody) tests at NCI was established to enhance the U.S. Government's ability to conduct an independent evaluation of serology tests and inform FDA recommendations and decision making. Since the program began, we have seen some inconsistent performance between the clinical validation performed by the sponsor and the independent evaluation performed at NCI for several serology tests evaluated to date, particularly lateral flow tests. We have also received reports of under-performing serology tests in clinical use and there have been several reports published in the scientific literature suggesting that some lateral flow tests, in particular, have clinically unacceptable performance. In light of these findings, lateral flow serology tests are generally undergoing independent evaluation performed by NCI, or by another government agency designated by FDA, prior to EUA authorization. FDA may also leverage this independent evaluation for serology tests that use other technologies, such as chemiluminescence or ELISA, to inform regulatory decision making on EUA requests and other actions. This may be particularly helpful when data in submissions raise questions. FDA will continue to decide whether to authorize a test based on the totality of scientific evidence available. As the pandemic progresses and FDA continues to learn through real world experience with SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests, FDA will continue to adapt to the rapidly evolving circumstances as public health needs warrant. <SEP>  How is FDA using NCI validation data for SARS-CoV-2 serology (antibody) tests?

Unlike SARS and swine flu, the novel coronavirus is both highly contagious and especially deadly, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said. 
“SARS was also a coronavirus, and it was a new virus at the time,” Gupta said. “In the end, we know that SARS ended up infecting 8,000 people around the world and causing around 800 deaths. So very high fatality rate, but it didn’t turn out to be very contagious.”
The swine flu, or H1N1, “was very contagious and infected some 60 million people in the United States alone within a year,” Gupta said. “But it was far less lethal than the flu even — like 1/3 as lethal as the flu.” 
What makes the novel coronavirus different is that “this is both very contagious … and it appears to be far more lethal than the flu as well,” Gupta said. “So both those things, in combination I think, are why we’re taking this so seriously.” <SEP> What’s so different about coronavirus that made us shut down the economy? Why do we have to practice social distancing now, when we didn’t during the SARS and swine flu epidemics? <EOS>
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19. <SEP> What is a coronavirus? <EOS>
To obtain both timely and detailed data on COVID-19 cases in the United States, CDC uses two different data sources. The first data source is an aggregate count based on a daily, robust, multistep process to collect the data and confirm the case and death numbers with jurisdictions:

A CDC data team collects information from jurisdictions’ websites, and a separate CDC data team doublechecks the information from the websites.
CDC then shares the data back with the jurisdictions for confirmation or corrections.
CDC reconciles any differences and posts the finalized information to the CDC web.

This process is collaborative, with CDC and the jurisdictions working together to ensure the accuracy of the COVID-19 case and death numbers published on the CDC website. These aggregate counts provide the most up-to-date numbers on cases and deaths, and CDC may update the counts after posting based on any updated information from jurisdictions.
The second data source involves patient-level data for each case, which provide additional information about whether the patient died and other details such as age and race/ethnicity. CDC receives the patient-level data, primarily from state health departments, without personal identifiers such as names or home addresses. Because it can be time-consuming for jurisdictions to collect the additional information, these data can lag behind the aggregate counts. Although CDC receives this information for most cases, CDC does not receive it for all cases. <SEP> What data sources does CDC use for COVID-19 case surveillance? <EOS>
Create a schedule - every problem has a solution! Create a schedule through which you can finish other activities while maintaining your time for schoolwork.

Have conversations with employees if they express concerns. Some people may be at higher risk of severe illness. This includes older adults (65 years and older) and people of any age with serious underlying medical conditions. By using strategies that help prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace, you will help protect all employees, including those at higher risk. These strategies include:

Implementing telework and other social distancing practices
Actively encouraging employees to stay home when sick
Providing sick leave
Promoting handwashing
Providing supplies and appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) for cleaning and disinfecting workspaces
Requiring all employees to wear cloth face coverings

In workplaces where it is not possible to eliminate face-to-face contact (such as retail), consider assigning employees who are at higher risk of severe illness work tasks that allow them to maintain a 6-foot distance from others, if feasible.
Employers should not require employees to provide a note from their healthcare provider when they are sick and instead allow them to inform their supervisors or employee health services when they have conditions that put them at higher risk for diseases. <SEP> How can I help protect employees who may be at higher risk for severe illness? <EOS>

Travel has been shown to facilitate the spread of COVID-19 from affected to unaffected areas. Travel and trade restrictions during a public health event of international concern (PHEIC) are regulated under the International Health Regulations (IHR), part III.
On 16 March, in an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus, the European Union leaders agreed to a temporary restriction on non-essential travel from third countries into the EU area by closing its borders for the next 30 days staring on 17 March 2020. On 8 April, the Commission invited Member States and non-EU Schengen countries to extend the temporary restrictions on non-essential travel to the EU until 15 May. The temporary travel restriction foresees exemptions for nationals of all EU Member States and Schengen Associated States (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland; whilst UK nationals are still to be treated in the same way as EU citizens until end 2020), for the purposes of returning to their homes. Exceptions are also foreseen for travellers with an essential function or need.
In addition, most EU countries have also applied national borders closure and/or border checks and travel and transport restrictions or bans within their national borders and between different regions as a measure to slow the spread. See the measures implemented by EU Member States.
Mobility measures implemented or announced by Member States
Many EU countries have also encouraged their citizens to return home (with recommendations for 14 days self-quarantine upon return) but also recommended that travellers avoid non-essential travels to areas with transmission of COVID-19. <SEP> 1.

 Inpatient facilities must provide discharge documents to the providers and outpatient clinics to ensure coordination of care. In the event that not all discharge documents are available, the providers and outpatient clinics are required to conduct the follow up appointment based on the available information to determine additional care and next steps for the patient’s recovery. The Health Information Exchange (HIE) or secure electronic means should be used to share  documents. Facilities and providers are encouraged to contact Health Current to enroll in the HIE if they have not done so. <SEP>  Due to restricted contact at inpatient facilities related to the COVID-19 emergency, what if the providers or outpatient clinics do not have all of the discharge documents when the member comes in for their follow up appointment post discharge? <EOS>
When people recover from COVID-19, their blood contains antibodies that their bodies produced to fight the coronavirus and help them get well. Antibodies are found in plasma, a component of blood.Convalescent plasma — literally plasma from recovered patients — has been used for more than 100 years to treat a variety of illnesses from measles to polio, chickenpox, and SARS. It is widely believed to be safe.In the current situation, antibody-containing plasma from a recovered patient is given by transfusion to a patient who is suffering from COVID-19. The donor antibodies may help the patient fight the illness, possibly shortening the length or reducing the severity of the disease.Though convalescent plasma has been used for many years, and with varying success, not much is known about how effective it is for treating COVID-19. A recent analysis of 35,000 hospitalized patients who received convalescent plasma to treat severe COVID-19 suggests that the therapy may reduce the risk of dying. The data comes from the ongoing Expanded Access Program (EAP) led by the Mayo Clinic. The researchers found that patients with (or at risk of) severe COVID-19 who received convalescent plasma within three days of diagnosis were less likely to die than patients who received convalescent plasma later in their illness.The problem? The study has no control group. All patients who are eligible to get convalescent plasma under the EAP receive that treatment. As a result, questions remain as to whether, or the degree to which, convalescent plasma is effective for treating COVID-19; who would benefit from this treatment; and when in the course of illness convalescent plasma is most effective. (High demand to enroll in the program may have also unintentionally driven down enrollment in randomized, controlled studies of convalescent plasma across the country.)Despite this, the FDA has issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for convalescent plasma, which will make it easier for hospitals to provide the treatment to their patients. <SEP> What is convalescent plasma? Does it help people with COVID-19? <EOS>
In outdoor spaces, large-scale spraying or fumigation in areas such as streets or open market places for the COVID-19 virus or other pathogens is not recommended. Streets and sidewalks are not considered as routes of infection for COVID-19. Spraying disinfectants, even outdoors, can be noxious for people’s health and cause eye, respiratory or skin irritation or damage.This practice will be ineffective since the presence of dirt or rubbish for example, inactivates the disinfectant, and manual cleaning to physically remove all matter is not feasible. This is even less effective on porous surfaces such as sidewalks and unpaved walkways. Even in the absence of dirt or rubbish, it is unlikely that chemical spraying would adequately cover surfaces allowing the required contact time to inactivate pathogens. <SEP> What is the guidance for the disinfection of outdoor spaces such as open markets, roads? <EOS>

By far, the greatest risk of COVID-19 exposure to staff, volunteers, and the public comes from person-to-person contact. At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. However, because we are still learning about this virus and because all animals can carry germs that can make people sick, it is always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals.
If asked to provide care for an animal exposed to a person with COVID-19, veterinarians and veterinary staff can take the following precautions:

Whenever possible, have a healthy household member or friend bring the animal to your clinic to limit contact with sick people.

Entry into the home where a person with COVID-19 lived should be avoided in order to prevent person-to-person transmission. Companion animals should be collected with minimal contact with people living in the home. This includes remaining a minimum of 6 feet away from other people and limiting contact with the home environment.
If collection of the animal means interacting with people from COVID-19 infected households or being exposed to home environments that might be contaminated with the virus, public health officials may recommend personal protective equipment (PPE) and provide training in the proper use of such equipment. Consult with your local health department.


Wash hands with soap and water or use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol before and after handling a companion animal.
If an animal needs to be housed in an animal shelter, veterinary clinic, or boarding facility, gloves and gowns or coveralls should be worn while performing routine intake exams and treatments in order to reduce contagious disease risks.

Gloves and gowns or coveralls are a good infection prevention control practice generally, and continue to be important during the COVID-19 pandemic. Gowns or coveralls should be laundered before reuse if going to be reused.
Hands should always be washed with soap and water including after gloves are removed and discarded.
The animal intake area as well as materials in animal areas such as food and water bowls and bedding should be routinely cleaned and sanitized.
There is no need to bathe an animal because of COVID-19 concerns; at this time, there is no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 can spread to people from the skin or fur of pets.
Animals that were in contact with COVID-19 should be separated from the general animal population during the animal’s stay due to the unknown risks associated with this rapidly evolving emerging infectious disease.

Every effort should be made to promptly reunite sheltered companion animals with their owners.
Animals that need to be adopted or sent to a foster home should be held for 14 days out of an abundance of caution.


Dogs should be walked outside for elimination and exercise but direct contact with other companion animals should be avoided as a best practice to protect animal health.
Routine cleaning and disinfection is important in animal areas. Cleaning of visibly dirty surfaces followed by disinfection is a best practice measure. Normal cleaning and disinfection protocols for both animal housing and common areas used in shelters are sufficient. Increased sanitation of surfaces frequently touched by people (e.g. light switches and door knobs) is recommended to reduce exposure to/from humans

Institutions should consider ramping down animal research activities, allowing critical duties (maintaining daily animal care) to take priority. The IACUC may identify the impacted protocols and transfer them en masse to holding protocols with the expectation that the research protocols may require modifications when facilities become operational. As with individual protocols, the transfers must be documented, and capabilities must be in place to provide husbandry and veterinary care to transferred animals. Per diem charges during this time are allowable for animals placed on an IACUC-approved holding protocol and maintained throughout the duration of the research stoppage. Recipients may rebudget funds to accommodate unanticipated costs without prior approval when rebudgeting does not constitute a change in scope and is not restricted by the terms and conditions of award (see NIH GPS  8.1). <SEP> 6.

The economic toll inflicted by COVID-19 and the corresponding efforts to contain its spread has been devastating. Both workers and businesses as well as government’s fiscal capacity have been significantly affected by the crisis. Thus, as some jurisdictions have made progress in controlling the outbreak, demand for reopening businesses and increasing commercial opportunities has increased significantly. But too fast or widespread a reopening runs the risk of triggering further outbreaks and reversing any progress that has been made, not only in terms of protecting human health and but also with reinvigorating the economy. 
Closing was, ironically, the easy part.  As a city leader, you are now balancing three criteria to assess opening up: contact intensity (gyms are different than dry cleaners); number of contacts (500 is different than 5 people in an enclosed space); and the possibility of modifications to minimize the risks (PPE, one-way lanes in markets, limited seating, etc.)
It should also be noted that different jurisdictions will face considerably different sets of circumstances when assessing the risks. For instance, the economic impacts of COVID-19 are shaping up (so far) to be unevenly distributed across the United States.   Opportunity Insights Economic Tracker has information on the economic impacts of COVID-19 on people, businesses, and communities across the United States in real time. (Juliette Kayyem, 5/19/20) <SEP> Are there ways to measure the economic impact of reopening to compare it to the immediate health risks? <EOS>
States have received guidance from the CDC on how to keep voting locations clean. It’s up to you whether you feel comfortable going.

The springtime administration of the New Jersey Student Learning Assessments (NJSLA), ACCESS for ELLs, and the Dynamic Learning Maps (DLM) assessment have been cancelled.
On March 24, 2020, Governor Murphy announced that the State of New Jersey cancelled all statewide student assessments for the spring 2020 testing window. On April 7, 2020, Governor Murphy waived the student assessment requirement for graduation for this year, including the portfolio appeal process. Current high school seniors who have not yet satisfied the student assessment requirement will no longer have to submit a portfolio appeal in order to graduate.
In addition, the use of student testing data for educator evaluations has been waived.
The U.S. Department of Education has provided relief to states from federally mandated testing, accountability, and reporting requirements for this school year.
The New Jersey Department of Education will make the NJSLA available in the summer or fall for current high school freshman, sophomores, and juniors (and middle school students taking high-school level courses) who may want to use the NJSLA high school assessments to meet their graduation assessment requirements.
Current juniors and sophomores also have access to the menu of alternate assessments (the SAT, etc.) and the portfolio appeal process as pathways to complete their graduation assessment requirement. These students are not required to take the NJSLA to access the menu of alternate assessments or the portfolio appeal process.
Refer to the Department of Education COVID-19 webpage for more information on these and other issues as it becomes available.

CDC currently recommends that travelers defer all cruise travel worldwide. Cruise passengers are at increased risk of person-to-person spread of infectious diseases, including COVID-19, and outbreaks of COVID-19 have been reported on several cruise ships.
If a person does travel on a cruise, they should stay home for 14 days after returning from travel, monitor their health, avoid contact with people at higher risk for severe illness, and practice social distancing.
For additional information, see COVID-19 and Cruise Ship Travel. <SEP> Is it safe to go on a cruise? <EOS>
  AHCCCS has been notified that the 3M software will not recognize the new ICD-10 diagnosis code for COVID-19 prior to April 1, 2020.  Until the April 1, 2020 software release, hospitals should bill for other related conditions such as:
                
Pneumonia
Acute Bronchitis
Lower Respiratory Infection
ARDS - Acute respiratory distress syndrome

The April 1, 2020 release of 3M software will recognize the newly defined ICD-10 diagnosis code, U07.1, mapped to an existing APR-DRG code under the April 1, 2020 software release. <SEP>  How should hospitals that are reimbursed by APR-DRG bill for inpatient services related to the new ICD-10 diagnosis code for COVID-19? <EOS>
It depends on who advised you to quarantine. If public health instructed you to quarantine, get documentation from that specific public health agency (such as Tri-County, Denver Public Health, etc.).

There are no restrictions on healthy people (those without symptoms or signs of COVID-19) interacting with service or therapy animals. As animals can spread other diseases to people, it’s always a good idea to wash your hands after being around animals.
VDH recommends that sick people avoid contact with animals whenever possible. In some situations, it might be necessary for a patient to be in contact with these animals. For people who are sick and need to be around animals, they should wash their hands before and after interacting with animals and wear a facemask during animal contact. <SEP> What about service or therapy animals? <EOS>
Please don’t. The CDC advises using hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
Vodka typically contains between 35% and 46% percent alcohol.
If the stores are out of hand sanitizer and you want to make your own, the Nebraska Medical Center offers this recipe:
What you’ll need:

2/3 cup 91% isopropyl alcohol (rubbing alcohol)
1/3 cup aloe vera gel
Mixing bowl
Spoon or something for whisking
Small container, such as a 3-oz. travel bottle
Optional: essential oil to give your hand sanitizer a fragrance

Directions:In a mixing bowl, stir isopropyl alcohol and aloe vera gel together until well blended.Add 8-10 drops of scented essential oil (optional, but nice). Stir.Pour the homemade hand sanitizer into an empty container and seal. Write “hand sanitizer” on a piece of masking tape and attach to the bottle. <SEP> Can I use vodka as hand sanitizer? <EOS>
Vaccines work by imitating infection and stimulating a person's immune system to develop protections against a disease. Sometimes getting a vaccine can lead to mild symptoms of the disease, such as a fever. The CDC advises that such minor symptoms are normal and should be expected as the body builds immunity. Different vaccines can work in different ways and each way has its advantages and disadvantages. For example, some require just one dose and others may require multiple doses to be given. Further, vaccines that work by giving people a weakened form of the virus, which for most people causes no more than mild, if any, illness, may not be suitable for people with weakened immune systems. The CDC encourages people to talk with their doctor to decide what vaccinations are right for them.

The primary and most important mode of transmission for COVID-19 is through close contact from person-to-person. Respiratory secretions or droplets expelled by infected individuals can contaminate surfaces and objects. Transmission may occur when a person touches surfaces contaminated with virus from an infected person and then touches their mouth, nose, or eyes. Frequent hand washing and cleaning and disinfection of high-touch surfaces (such as door knobs) can help prevent viral transmission. <SEP> What is known about virus transmission via contaminated surfaces? <EOS>
If you have been in close contact with your co-worker: You should self-quarantine away from others for 14 days since the last day you had contact with that person. Your employer should contact you with further instructions. It is possible that your local health department will call you to discuss your risk, you can also reach out to your local health department. If you develop symptoms of respiratory illness, and are concerned about your health, please call your healthcare provider.
If you have not been in close contact with your co-worker: You should monitor yourself for symptoms of respiratory illness and remember to practice good social distance, but quarantine is not required. You should follow any instructions from your employer carefully. If you develop any symptoms, you should self-isolate at home and contact a healthcare provider if you are concerned about your health. Remember to follow appropriate precautions for cleaning your work area, hand hygiene, and respiratory etiquette.
Expanded testing is also available across the state. Now, most people are eligible to be tested for COVID-19, even if they don’t have symptoms. Look for a testing site using the Testing Site Look Up Tool or call the COVID-19 hotline at 888-535-6136 for help finding a site near you. 
Tests may be ordered by a doctor, pharmacist or nurse for anyone and for any reason. Some testing locations offer screening and testing without a doctor’s order.

Symptoms, especially early on, may be mild and feel like a common cold. Early symptoms could include a combination of cough, body aches, fatigue, and chest tightness. A fever may not appear until several days into the illness, and some people may never develop a fever throughout the duration of the illness. People who have symptoms should get tested and self-isolate.
More advanced symptoms include fever, cough, shortness of breath, or breathing difficulties, and more. These people also should get tested, self-isolate, and contact a medical provider as necessary. 
In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure, and death. <SEP> What are the symptoms of COVID-19? <EOS>
When communicating with staff, the CDC recommends that health care facilities are aware of the following best practices:
Implement source control for all visitors, patients and staff entering your practice or health care facility, regardless of symptoms.
Encourage patients and visitors to wear cloth masks when visiting to prevent transmission from non-symptomatic individuals.
Screen patients and visitors for symptoms of acute respiratory illness (e.g., fever, cough, difficulty breathing) before entering your health care facility.
Ensure proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE).
Conduct an inventory of available PPE.
Encourage sick employees to stay home

The governor and public health officials remain guided by science, data and facts in making decisions regarding COVID-19. Since moving into Phase 2 on May 22, 2020, several key metrics have been trending in a concerning direction:
North Carolina’s daily number of positive COVID-19 tests is continuing to increase.
The percentage of COVID-19 tests that are positive has remained high.
Emergency department visits for COVID-19 like illnesses are increasing.
Hospitalizations for COVID-19 continue to increase.
Doctors, public health officials, hospital administrators and health care providers are concerned that unless the spread of COVID-19 is limited, existing health care facilities may not have the capacity to care for those who become sick.
Additionally, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, testified before Congress on June 23, 2020, that the “next couple weeks are going to be critical” in the country’s ability to address increasing rates of COVID-19 infection.
In order to address these troubling metrics and slow the spread of COVID-19, North Carolina is continuing the measures of Executive Order No. 141, “the Phase 2 Executive Order”  and is imposing a face-covering requirement — to slow the spread of this virus during the pandemic. <SEP> Why is North Carolina extending Safer at Home Phase 2? <EOS>
Your care team will work with you to identify the most appropriate post-operative plan, specific to your surgery and individual needs.

One way to reduce the volume of 911 calls is to educate people about when they should call. For areas that have lots of cases and don't have testing capacity, there are six reasons those with mild symptoms should not get tested today that we developed for New York City. These reasons would also apply for 911 calls. (Dr. Tom Frieden, 4/9/20)
Baltimore just launched a call center that is triggered by calling 311 or 211. Callers can get referrals from trained people who talk to them about their symptoms, arrange for testing and clinical care, and link to other supports. Setting up a call center—or if you have a 311 or 211 line, developing a script and really promoting that number as opposed to 911—may reduce the pressure. (Dr. Josh Sharfstein, 4/9/20)
Some people calling 311 lines with mental health concerns don't have a particular issue that the operator can respond to. Work with mental health professionals to figure out what kind of scripting could help operators direct people to either appropriate mental health resources in their community or more specialized helplines. (Dr. Kim Leary, 4/9/20) <SEP> How can you prepare for 911 call surges before they happen? <EOS>

The virus that causes COVID-19 is spread through close contact from person to person in respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.  
Although not as common, you could get COVID-19 if you touch an object or a surface that has the virus on it, and then touch your eyes, nose, or mouth. That's why washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds is so important for protecting yourself and slowing the spread. <SEP> How does COVID-19 spread? <EOS>
Yes. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) developed a test that is used to diagnose the COVID-19 virus in most public health laboratories. In addition, many hospital and commercial labs have developed their own tests.

In times of shortage, consideration can be made to use N95 respirators beyond the manufacturer-designated shelf life. Facilities should contact the manufacturer to receive further guidance before using or disposing of the expired respirators. CDC/NIOSH also lists specific models that have continued to perform past their manufacturer-designated shelf life. Users should perform a user seal check immediately after they don each respirator and should not use a respirator on which they cannot perform a successful user seal check. If the integrity of any part of the respirator is compromised, or if a successful user seal check cannot be performed, discard the respirator and try another respirator.

The Executive Order includes exemptions to the face covering mandate for people with certain medical conditions, mental health conditions, or disabilities. When a customer or visitor claims to be exempt due to a medical or mental health condition or disability, businesses may not require proof of the condition or disability, or require customers or visitors to explain the nature of their condition or disability. When possible, and as long as it does not pose a health or safety to risk to workers or other customers or visitors, businesses must provide accommodations to customers and visitors who are unable to wear a face covering. In all situations, a business must work to reduce worker and customer exposure to people who are unable to wear a face covering. Potential accommodations and steps to reduce exposure to COVID-19 must be based on the most up-to-date public health recommendations and may include one or more of the following:

Offering curbside or other contactless pick up options;
Permitting the customer to wear an alternative face covering (e.g., a face shield); and/or
Implementing a protocol that ensures strict social distancing is maintained between customers and workers at all times while the customer is indoors (which may be supplemented by additional protective measures, such as installing plexiglass barriers in areas where customers or workers regularly interact, or limiting customer capacity). 

If the business cannot reasonably accommodate a customer who is unable to wear a face covering or an alternative in a way that minimizes or eliminates potential exposure to others, (for example, if the nature of the business does not allow curbside pick-up and makes strict social distancing impossible or unlikely), or if the customer refuses the accommodations, the business is allowed to and should refuse service to the customer. See the next question for more information on this topic. <SEP> What should a business do when a customer or visitor claims to be exempt from the face covering mandate? <EOS>

Note that there is a difference between Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and Public Health Measures (PHMs). The CoC will not be ordering civilian employees back into the workplace without having all PHMs, such as non-medical masks, in place for their employees. This is one of the OHS Conditions for Business Resumption Planning.
If 2 metre physical distancing is impossible or difficult, civilian employees could be asked to wear their own cloth face mask, until their L1 or Commands are able to provide masks to them. Otherwise employees should expect to work from home until the full spectrum of local PHMs are in place. <SEP> PPE is one of the conditions to be met in the Directive on Resumption Activities.

According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), there have not been any cases of COVID-19 known to be caused from eating food or handling food packaging. Here are some steps you can follow to help protect yourself when ordering groceries or carryout: 
Before ordering groceries or carryout, check to see if you can pay online or over the phone.
Ask the delivery person to leave your packages at the door or on the porch.
If you go in person and curbside pickup is not available, make sure you maintain 6 feet of distance between you and the cashier.
Because carryout bags and containers have been touched recently by others, it is important to wash your hands after handling these.
Dispose of all packaging, and wash your hands again before eating.

Case surveillance data are useful for tracking national trends in disease incidence (the number of new cases of a disease in a population at a certain time period). Limitations of using case surveillance data to understand the epidemiology (who, what, where, when, how) of COVID-19 include the following:
First, case surveillance data do not represent the true burden of COVID-19 in the United States. Many people infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 do not seek medical care or do not get tested. The information collected might be limited if people are unavailable or unwilling to provide additional information or if medical records are unavailable for data extraction.
Second, most of the case reports captured by health departments are based on laboratory reports that usually contain limited information on the patient. Because of the volume of cases, most health departments are not able to conduct investigations of every case to obtain additional information.  Consequently, the majority of case reports are missing data on patient demographics, symptoms, underlying health conditions, characteristics of hospitalizations such as ventilator use, and other factors such as recent travel history. Because of missing data, analyses of these data elements are likely an underestimate of the true occurrence.
Third, it is difficult to capture asymptomatic cases through case surveillance. People who are asymptomatic are unlikely to seek testing unless they are identified through active screening (e.g., contact tracing), and investigation of symptomatic persons is prioritized.
When disease volume is high and a limited number of data elements are captured on each reported case, case surveillance data can be used to assess population burden, track the spread of the disease, monitor increases and decreases in cases in association with mitigation strategies, and study selected demographics such as age, sex, race and ethnicity, and geography. Clinical details and other characteristics about persons with COVID-19 can be better assessed through special studies. CDC conducts these special epidemiologic studies to better understand risk factors, such as underlying conditions and disabilities, that might put people at more risk for serious infection and studies the clinical course of illness with data on hospitalization and treatments. <SEP> What are the limitations in using case surveillance data to understand the epidemiology of COVID-19? <EOS>
Many colleges are allowing you to do so, but check with your admissions counselor before you make a decision. You might be unpleasantly surprised. 
Already, some colleges are bleeding students, as a large number of high school seniors have put off a decision about where to go to college in the fall — or whether to go at all.
If you can take a gap year, though, it might not be a terrible idea. 
For some families, lost income makes it impossible to consider paying tuition right now. For others, it’s more about a refusal to forgo the yearned-for experiences of university life outside the classroom — giggling through late nights with roommates, exploring new interests through campus clubs, playing or cheering for sports teams — for a pale, Zoom-fueled imitation. They’d rather take a year off and try again in 2021.

 Decisions made to open shelters are made at the local and county level due to weather threats. The shelter and persons can take as many precautions within the shelter as possible to enhance social distancing and promote respiratory hygiene. At this time, ADPH is recommending that citizens' first priority should be to protect themselves from a potential tornado.

Thus, people should heed tornado warnings and take appropriate shelter. <SEP>  Is it safe to go to a shelter during a weather threat? <EOS>
Businesses within a large building of multiple offices only need to screen employees from the area of the building where an individual with a suspected or confirmed positive case of COVID- 19 has worked. For example, if the COVID positive person works on a single floor of a building only that floor would need to be screened.
However, businesses should be mindful of bathrooms, breakrooms, building lobbies and other frequently visited areas. The Department of Health recommends temperature screenings be conducted, at all times, however, particularly in those areas of the Commonwealth with high positive case numbers. <SEP> Do all employees who work in a building need to have their temperatures checked even if they weren’t exposed to the suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19? <EOS>

As a health worker, there are things you can do to help mitigate the impacts of violence on women and children at any time, including during the COVID-19 pandemic.   Whilst your time and resources may be stretched during this health emergency, you have a duty of care to women who may seek help from you – often to address physical and mental hurt caused by violence.   You may need to adjust how you deliver services, if face-to-face care is not possible. Depending on your resources consider mobile phone, WhatsApp or other communication channels to deliver support, always ensuring you can do this in a way that is safe for the survivor. Communicate openly with women about any changes in service delivery.   If a woman with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 seeks your care because of violence, your response should be the same as for any other survivor. You should however ensure that you are protected from infection, by maintaining distance where possible, wearing protective clothing, practicing respiratory hygiene, and washing hands and surfaces with soap and water regularly and after touching, to avoid infection. In any circumstances, including during the COVID-19 pandemic, health workers should provide first-line support, using the LIVES approach to help women survivors of violence:  Listen closely, with empathy and no judgement Inquire about women’s needs and concerns Validate women’s experiences.

There is limited scientific evidence on the severity of illness in pregnant women after COVID-19 infection. It seems that pregnant women appear to experience similar clinical manifestations as non-pregnant women who have progressed to COVID-19 pneumonia and to date (as of 25 March), there have been no maternal deaths, no pregnancy losses and only one stillbirth reported. No current evidence suggests that infection with COVID-19 during pregnancy has a negative effect on the foetus. At present, there is no evidence of transmission of COVID-19 from mother to baby during pregnancy and only one confirmed COVID-19 neonatal case has been reported to date.
ECDC will continue to monitor the emerging scientific literature on this question, and suggests that all pregnant women follow the same general precautions for the prevention of COVID-19, including regular handwashing, avoiding individuals who are sick, and self-isolating in case of any symptoms, while consulting a healthcare provider by telephone for advice. <SEP> 4.

Charter fishing services, for-hire vessels, and watercraft rental businesses may open so long as they follow required social distancing measures.
What To Expect
The following summarizes some of the protocols contained in EO 146, EO 157, and EO 158. However, this summary is not a replacement for fully complying with the terms of EO 146, EO 157, and EO 158, and businesses should read the full guidance carefully to ensure full compliance.
Charter fishing services, for-hire vessels, and watercraft rental businesses must adopt policies that include:

Limiting total capacity of any outdoor area to a number that ensures that all individuals can remain six feet apart
Limiting the number of patrons in any indoor premises to 25 percent capacity – excluding employees
Requiring crew and passengers to wear a face covering while aboard the vessel, in indoor areas, and in outdoor areas when social distancing is difficult to maintain, except where doing so would inhibit that individual's health
If a customer refuses to wear a cloth face covering for non-medical reasons then the business must decline the individual entry into the indoor premises
Prohibiting food and beverage service
Social distancing measures on the vessels and in waiting and boarding areas, including demarcation and signage;
Prohibiting sharing of fishing equipment, bait, and gear
Limiting the use of nets or gaffs to the crew
Providing sanitization materials to passengers and crew
Frequent sanitization of vessel and high-touch areas
Limit occupancy in restrooms that remain open to avoid over-crowding and maintain social distancing through signage and, where practicable, the utilization of attendants to monitor capacity
Require reservations, cancellations and prepayments be made via electronic or telephone reservation systems to limit physical interactions

Guidance For Employees
Recreational businesses must impose the following requirements on employees:

Require employees with symptoms of COVID-19 be sent home
Require all employees to wear face coverings while indoors, except where doing so would inhibit the individual's health
Require workers to wear gloves when in contact with customers or goods
Provide all employees with face coverings and gloves free of charge
Provide employees break time for repeated handwashing throughout the workday
Provide sanitization materials, such as hand sanitizer and sanitizing wipes to staff

It is recommended that you do not skip your prenatal care appointments or postpartum appointments.  If you are concerned about attending your appointment due to COVID-19, talk to your healthcare provider. Ask your healthcare provider how they are taking steps to separate healthy patients from those who may be sick. Some healthcare providers might choose to cancel or postpone some visits. Others may switch certain appointments to telemedicine visits, which are appointments over the phone or video. These decisions will be based on the circumstances in your community as well as your individual care plan.
Call your healthcare provider if you have an urgent medical question. In case of emergency, call 911 or go to your local emergency department. If you are not driving, call the emergency department on the way to explain that you are pregnant and have an emergency. They should have an infection prevention plan to protect you from getting COVID-19 if you need emergency care. Do not delay getting emergency care because of COVID-19. <SEP> Should I continue to go to doctor’s appointments for my prenatal care? <EOS>
You will not know for certain if you have the novel coronavirus or COVID-19 unless you get an official test from a doctor, the hospital or a medical or government-supervised testing clinic. Whether or not tests are available, you must be alert to the possible symptoms that can indicate you might have the virus. According the the CDC, these include: Fever, coughing, shortness of breath. These symptoms will appear about 2 to 14 days after you have been exposed to the virus. The CDC also makes it clear that the following signs are an emergency: Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath; persistent pain or pressure in your chest region; feeling confused; inability to be aroused from sleep or doziness; lips or face that appear bluish. If you or a loved one has these emergency symptoms, you must get medical help quickly.

Children often think about themselves first when they're in a crisis and they may become very self-centered. This is expected. Allow children to express when they're feeling distressed about something they're going to miss like a birthday party or a soccer game. Allow children to experience and express that distress and don't judge it.
One of the things that's so unsettling about a crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic is that people don't know what's going to happen. That sense of unpredictability makes people feel very vulnerable. For kids especially, I suggest creating some sense of predictability around things adults can control such as the schedule at home. You may not be able to tell kids when they're going to be able to go to the playground or to friend’s house, but you can tell them what time dinner will be. You can tell them what time you're going to sit down and play a board game or read a story together. Try to keep to that kind of schedule to the extent that’s possible because it's reassuring to children. <SEP> What should I do if my child is having behavioral issues during this time? <EOS>
Cloth face coverings can reduce the release of virus particles into the air when a person with COVID-19 speaks, coughs, or sneezes. You can help prevent the spread of COVID-19 by wearing a cloth face covering, even if you don’t think you have COVID-19. Cloth face coverings are not a substitute for physical distancing, washing hands, and staying home when ill, but they may be helpful when combined with these actions. <SEP> How do cloth face coverings work to prevent spread of COVID-19? <EOS>
What is the application process and are there deadlines?
The application to become a Designated Vendor is in two parts: a Program Application (available online here) and a Legal Questionnaire, to be completed following the submittal of the Program Application. Interested applicants should note that the Program Application form cannot be saved and therefore must be completed in one sitting. To simplify your preparation for that and for completing the Legal Questionnaire, both of those documents are available in PDF form by clicking the links below:

Program Application
Legal Questionnaire

The application has certain requirements as to completeness, execution and signing. All interested applicants are encouraged to read the full instructions before starting work on the form.
Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis as they are received, and the application period will end on November 12, 2020. Applicants will be evaluated against eligibility criteria and asked to confirm their ability and willingness to meet certain vendor performance requirements (as described in questions below). Applicants will be notified of the outcome by email, with an opportunity to provide additional or clarifying information, if necessary.
Once approved, Designated Vendors will be asked to sign the NJ PPE Access Program and Subsidy Agreement and present a demonstration version of their NJ PPE Access e-commerce site within two weeks.
What will the State of New Jersey do to support Designated Vendors in the Program?
The State is deeply concerned about enabling the safe reopening of businesses of every size and considers this Program a key step in that process. Acting through the NJ Economic Development Authority and with the support of the Office of the Governor, the State will actively promote the program both through direct marketing efforts, public and social media and through direct outreach to community, business and industry organizations across the state.
What are the eligibility requirements to become a "Designated Vendors" under the Program?

Who should complete the application form? What about the Legal Questionnaire?
Companies should designate a program manager to complete the application form and be the main point of contact between the company and NJEDA. This program manager should have experience in running projects of similar scope or scale as well as the authority to coordinate the approval process, including any suggested branding or technical changes to the PPE Access program site.
The Legal Questionnaire must be completed by an authorized signer. This can be:

for a corporation, a principal executive officer, at least the level of vice president;
for a partnership, a general partner;
for a sole proprietorship, the proprietor;
for a governmental entity, the contact person (business administrator, manager, mayor, etc.);
for other than above, the person with legal responsibility for the application.

The authorized signer must complete and sign the Legal Questionnaire, and submit this as an attached PDF to smallbusinessPPE@NJEDA.com, along with a Tax Clearance Certificate from New Jersey Division of Taxation, and any other clarifying documents required based on answers from the Legal Questionnaire.

The Office of the Chief Human Resources Officer (OCHRO) at TBS has been meeting with departments to gather information on their specific circumstances and to look at ways to enable performance and talent management activities in the context of COVID-19. Guidance has been that the annual deadline for submitting agreements would be extended due to the fact that several departments, such as DND, have experienced an impact to DWAN access, and as a result, an impact to accessing the PSPM App.
OCHRO is now looking at a deadline for completing 2019-20 year-end reviews in the PSPM app of 31 July, however, written confirmation from them is pending. In the meantime, managers should continue to assess employee performance and engage in ongoing and constructive discussions/feedback to align employees work with organizational priorities.
Regarding documenting performance:

With official DWAN access: If both you and your employee currently have access to the DWAN, please complete assessments in the PSPM App as per the usual process.
Without DWAN access: Please keep a record of your discussions for future reference and to transfer to the PSPM App at a later date once accesses have been reinstated. Ensure not to share performance feedback by email as it is designated Protected B information.

As soon as OCHRO confirms the official deadline for completing year-end reviews, guidance will be issued to L1s and updates posted to the HR Go App and HR Connect. Questions can also be forwarded to PerformanceManagement-GestionduRendement@forces.gc.ca. <SEP> Is there any direction on FY 19-20 PSPMs - is there a new deadline?

TRENTON – Governor Phil Murphy today signed Executive Order No. 181, which permits gyms and health clubs, as well as amusement and water parks, to reopen their indoor premises to the public on Tuesday, September 1 at 6:00 a.m., provided these facilities comply with the health and safety standards issued by the Department of Health.
"Gyms are among the most-challenging indoor environments to prevent the transmission of COVID-19," said Governor Murphy. "Given where we are in this fight and the overwhelming personal responsibility demonstrated by gym owners and gym members over the past several months, we can confidently take this important step on our road back."
"Exercise is very important for the body and the mind, but it needs to be done in a healthy environment to protect not only those in the facility, but the community at large," said Health Commissioner Judith Persichilli. "Given the potential for transmission indoors, this guidance provides strict guidelines for staff and customers to follow closely to stay healthy while enjoying their workout or class."
Under the Department of Health's Executive Directive, gyms and health clubs who reopen will be required to adhere to the health and safety standards listed in the "Guidance for Health Clubs/Gyms/Fitness Centers". These standards, which will also apply to other recreational businesses that offer fitness classes and activities, include the following, among others:

Limit occupancy of any indoor premises to 25 percent of the stated maximum capacity;
Conduct a temperature screening and questionnaire of staff and clients upon entrance to the facility;
Limit indoor group activities (e.g., classes) to no more than 1 individual per 200 square feet of accessible space or less, with all individuals being able to maintain 6 feet of distance from other individuals during the entire class;
Require workers and customers to wear cloth face coverings at all times, except where doing so would inhibit that individual's health, such as when in the water and in other situations where the presence of a mask would pose a risk to the individual's health, or where the individual is under two years of age;
Demarcate six feet of distance between equipment, or blocking off equipment (e.g. every other machine) to maintain six feet of distancing between individuals using equipment;
Require that reservations, cancellations and pre-payments be made via electronic or telephone reservation systems to limit physical interactions;
Limit occupancy in restrooms to avoid over-crowding;
Inform clients to arrive dressed to workout/train and bring their own hand towel, water, yoga mat, boxing gloves, and any other equipment;
Not permit the use of showers, with the exception of gyms with pools, which can have individually partitioned showers or communal showers with installed barriers/partitions at least six feet apart;
Limit locker room use to hand washing and restroom use only; and
Adopt infection control practices and enhanced sanitization protocols.

Activities such as swimming in an indoor pool, tanning, outdoor dining, pick-up of food or beverage, and retail sales, which are otherwise permitted but which are not governed by the guidance, remain subject to applicable standards outlined in Executive Orders, Executive Directives and guidance.

Dog parks provide socialization and exercise for dogs, which is an important part of their wellbeing. Because there is a small risk that people with COVID-19 could spread it to animals, CDC recommends that you do not let pets interact with people outside of your household, especially in places with community spread of COVID-19. Therefore, you should consider avoiding dog parks or other places where large numbers of people and dogs gather.
Some areas are allowing dog parks to open. If you choose to go to a dog park, follow local guidelines. There are ways to reduce the risk of you or your dog getting infected with COVID-19 if you go to a dog park.

Do not take your dog to a dog park if you are sick or if you have recently been in close contact with a person with COVID-19.
Do not take your dog to a dog park if your dog is sick. Signs of sickness in dogs may include fever, coughing, difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, lethargy, sneezing, discharge from the nose or eyes, vomiting, or diarrhea.
If your dog has tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19, talk to your veterinarian about when it is appropriate for your pet to go back to normal activities.
Try to limit your dog’s interaction with other people outside of your household while at the dog park.
As much as possible, avoid touching common items in the dog park like water bowls. Wash your hands or use hand sanitizer after touching items from the park. To make sure your dog has fresh water, consider bringing your own portable water bowl.
Limit other pet items brought to the dog park, such as toys. Clean and disinfect anything taken to the park and returned home (leashes, toys, water bowls).
Do not wipe or bathe your dog with chemical disinfectants, alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or any other products not approved for animal use.

Universal masking is challenging in child care settings—particularly those that serve young children—due to the importance of communication for child development. These settings also may be able to mitigate risks of transmission by grouping staff and children together in consistent “cohorts” that do not mix with others. Accordingly, the Executive Order grants flexibility to the following child care settings, as long as they serve children 5 and under: family and group day care homes (licensed under Minnesota Rules 2019, chapter 9502); child care centers (licensed under Minnesota Rules 2019, chapter 9503); certified centers (certified under Minnesota Statutes 2019, chapter 245H); legal non-licensed child care providers (defined under Minnesota Statutes 2019, section 119B, subdivision 16); certain license-exempt Head Start, public and private school programs (defined under Minnesota Statutes 2019, section 245A.03, subdivision 2 (a) (5), (13), and (26)); and other Head Start, preschool and pre-kindergarten programs.
In general, either a face covering or face shield is required for all staff in child care settings when in communal areas, hallways or lobbies. When isolated in a classroom or home care environment with one group or cohort, face coverings are strongly recommended, but not required. Children 5 years and under are exempt from the face covering requirement, and a child care setting that serves children under 5 may choose to exempt older children by fulfilling specific requirements (i.e. written notice to all families and documentation in COVID-19 Preparedness Plans). For additional requirements, guidance, and information, please refer to the Executive Order at Executive Orders from Governor Walz and MDH guidance on COVID-19 Prevention Guidance for Youth, Student, and Child Care Programs (PDF). <SEP> What are the requirements for child care, preschool and pre-kindergarten? <EOS>
Yes, but be sure to practice social distancing by staying at least six-feet away from others.
All State Parks and Forests have re-opened. On days of high visitation, some parks may close early. As visitors leave, parks may reopen. Before visiting, check the New Jersey State Park Services' Facebook page for closing and reopening announcements.
Face coverings are required in outdoor spaces whenever social distancing is difficult to maintain.
All gatherings in parks must comply with the rules placed on outdoor gatherings, which limits capacity to no more than 500 people. There are no limits for First Amendment-protected outdoor activities, such as political protests of any persuasion or outdoor religious services.
State police and local police will regularly patrol parks to ensure that proper social distancing protocol is followed.
NOTE: Local jurisdictions can decide whether or not to open county and municipal parks, depending upon local circumstances, and may impose additional restrictions on gatherings.

 On July 15, 2020, a Statewide Mask Requirement was issued You have to wear a mask when you are in public and in close contact with other people. Mask Requirement Frequently Asked Questions. N95 and surgical masks should be used by healthcare workers and first responders, as they are the persons who need this high level of protection in their work. The CDC recommends the use of cloth face coverings in community settings (for example, grocery stores and pharmacies) where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain, especially in areas of significant community-based transmission. There continues to be more information that people who are infected can spread the virus before they develop symptoms or when they do not have symptoms. Wearing a cloth face covering may help prevent the spread of the virus by people are infected and do not know it.

Encourage students and staff to take everyday preventive actions to prevent the spread of respiratory illnesses. These actions include staying home when sick; appropriately covering coughs and sneezes; cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces; and washing hands often with soap and water. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if they are visibly dirty. Remember to supervise young children when they use hand sanitizer to prevent swallowing alcohol. <SEP> What can schools do to minimize the spread of COVID-19? <EOS>
Yes. If people in the home are coughing, have fevers or other symptoms of the coronavirus, this is good advice. As testing scales up, advice may change. (Dr. Josh Shafstein, 3/19/20) <SEP> Is it correct that if someone in your home is ill then you should also be staying at home? <EOS>
As food has not been implicated in the transmission of COVID-19, testing of food or food surfaces for this virus is not recommended. Frequent cleaning of food contact surfaces with virucidal disinfectants such as 0.05% sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) or products based on ethanol (at least 70%) should be carried out. Alcohol-based disinfectants (ethanol, propan-2-ol, propan-1-ol) have been shown to significantly reduce infectivity of enveloped viruses like SARS-CoV-2, in concentrations of 70-80% with one-minute exposure time. Chlorine-based disinfectants (sodium hypochlorite) are effective for surface decontamination, as are disinfectants with active ingredients based on quaternary ammonium compounds (QUATS). <SEP> What are the lab protocols for identifying the virus in food?

Unless it is unavoidable, two people 'suspected' of being infected should not be isolated together if they will have contact with each other or the potential to spread the disease between one another. That's because one of them may have contracted the virus and the other may not have and placing them in close proximity could result in both getting infected. If two people in the same household need to self-isolate then they should do so by themselves, taking the same precautions as if they were trying to isolate themselves near a healthy person.

"Register Ready -- New Jersey's Special Needs Registry for Disasters" allows New Jersey residents with disabilities or access and functional needs, and their families, friends, caregivers and associates, an opportunity to provide information to emergency response agencies so emergency responders can better plan to serve them in a disaster or other emergency.
All information collected is confidential and will not be available to the public. The information will be held securely and only used for emergency response and planning.
In addition, the Governor signed a new law requiring NJ TRANSIT's Access Link services, which provide public transportation to people with disabilities, to operate during a state of emergency if it can be done safely.
Updated Hospitalization Procedures
To better support individuals with disabilities during this public health crisis in circumstances where support is essential, the Department of Health has made some accommodations during hospitalization.

A designated healthy support person is permitted to be with an individual with a disability during hospitalization. The designated support person may be a family member, personal care assistant or another disability service provider.
Healthy is defined as individuals with no signs of respiratory illness such as fever, cough or shortness of breath. They should not have had contact with anyone with or suspected of having COVID-19 or any respiratory illness and individuals should be wearing the appropriate protective equipment

Fire camps can include thousands of personnel living together and working collectively to respond to a wildfire, often in remote areas. In many ways, fire camps are like small communities. For example, fire camps employ a number of support personnel, some of whom may be considered at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 (e.g., older adults and people with certain underlying medical conditions). Also, fire camps have many people coming and going throughout the day. Therefore, extra precautions should be taken. Note: Many of the recommendations in CDC’s COVID-19 Guidance for Shared or Congregate Housing also apply to fire camps.
The following are protective measures that can be employed within the fire camp to prevent COVID-19 transmission:

Screening of temperature and symptoms for everyone entering a fire camp and daily screening for those who remain at the camp
Encouraging personnel to maintain social distancing (6 feet or more) as much as feasible
Wearing cloth face coverings as a form of source control
Providing hand washing stations (soap and water) or hand sanitizers containing at least 60% alcohol throughout the camp, especially outside bathrooms, portable toilets, and dining facilities
Providing individual bottles of hand sanitizer for all personnel at the fire camp
Ensuring bathrooms, portable toilets, and handwash stations are well stocked with hygiene products (e.g., soap and water, hand sanitizer, paper towels)
Using disinfectants approved by the EPA for use against COVID-19external icon to clean showers, bathrooms, sinks, portable toilets, and handwash stations at least twice a day (in the morning and evening after heavy use) and commonly-touched surfaces in the dining facility before and after each meal. Make sure individuals doing the cleaning are trained on the proper application of the disinfectant and wear protective disposable gloves and other PPE as recommended by the disinfectant manufacturer
Instructing personnel to avoid placing toothbrushes (or other personal items) directly on sinks as that is a potential contamination pathway. Individual totes may be used to carry and keep personal items off sinks
Ensuring that food service personnel wear disposable gloves during preparation and serving of food and practice recommended hand hygiene
Staffing drink stations to limit the number of people touching the drink machines
Instructing personnel not to share personal items (e.g., cups, canteens, safety glasses, etc.) with others
Using ventilation systems, fans, or open windows to increase outdoor air circulation in enclosed spaces within the fire camp including command tents, dining facilities, and showers
Establishing housing in one area of the fire camp (or nearby community) that could be used for isolation, if necessary, and assigning someone on staff to make sure that anyone being isolated is provided with necessities. Note: it is likely people will get sick with illnesses other than COVID-19, but out of an abundance of caution, all illnesses should be treated as COVID-19 until medical staff determines otherwise
Ensuring medical staff in the fire camp are familiar with the CDC Guidance for Healthcare Professionals, which provides information on control measures, including PPE that should be worn, when caring for individuals with known or suspected COVID-19 <SEP> What precautions should be implemented for protecting firefighters and other personnel at fire camps? <EOS>
Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at a higher risk for COVID-19 than adults. While some children and infants have been sick with COVID-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date. Some reports suggest that infants under 1 year old and children with underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk of serious illness from COVID-19 than other children. <SEP> What is the risk of my child becoming sick with COVID-19? <EOS>
Take precautions anytime you feel sick by staying away from others and wearing a face mask if you must get within six feet of someone else. Contact you doctor and let them know that you think you have COVID-19 symptoms and would like to get tested for the virus.

Yes. On June 16, OMB rescinded its previous flexibility memos M-20-17 and M-20-20 and extended two specific flexibilities related to charging of salaries, and single audit. Details on the NIH implementation of these changes can be found here. Requests for flexibilities that were received prior to June 16, 2020, may still be approved by the funding IC. For awards funded with NIH COVID-19 supplemental appropriations, the flexibilities outlined in M-20-11 continue to apply through the end of the public health emergency, currently July 26. <SEP> 12. OMB has now rescinded many of the previous flexibilities outlined in NOT-OD-20-086. If my institution requested and received approval for a flexibility prior to June 16, 2020, does that approval still apply? <EOS>
Then, you're not alone friend. Many people are bored. There is almost nothing to do once the Netflix has been binged, the crafts all tried and the lawns mowed. However, you could try playing a video game like Minecraft for a long time, or make you own board game, and the hours will fly by. <SEP> What if there is nothing exciting to do at home during this epidemic? <EOS>
If you present symptoms related to COVID-19, seek medical advice. Call by phone first if possible and give information about pre-existing health conditions and medicines that you are taking. Follow the instructions of the health-care worker and monitor your symptoms regularly.  If you have difficulty breathing, contact health emergencies immediately as this may be due to a respiratory infection. Call by phone first if possible to learn what to do next. If you live with others, make sure that you isolate yourself as soon as you suspect infectionby using the space that you identified in advance. You and other members of the household should also wear a medical mask as much as possible if these are available. You can learn how to wear a mask here. If you live with others and home care for COVID-19 is advised by your health-care worker, other household members should follow available guidance on home care for patients with COVID-19 presenting with mild symptoms and management of their contacts (guidance here). See related flyers for people who are ill, for household members and for caregivers.  If you live alone and home care for COVID-10 is advised by your health-care worker, ask your family, friends, neighbours, health-care worker or a local volunteer organisation to check in on you regularly and to provide support as needed following existing guidance for caregivers (guidance here). <SEP> What should I do if I have symptoms of COVID-19? <EOS>
At this time, CDC has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks. The main way that COVID-19 spreads is from person to person.

Many news outlets are reporting that doctors at the Rajavithi Hospital in Bangkok, Thailand have experimented with treating the 2019-nCoV coronavirus with a combination of Tamiflu and HIV medications. However, this treatment is still very experimental and the possible risks and benefits haven’t been studied closely yet. The CDC and WHO aren’t currently recommending any specific medicinal treatment for the 2019-nCoV strain. Don’t try to treat coronavirus with Tamiflu or any other prescription medication without talking to your doctor first. <SEP> Can you treat coronavirus with Tamiflu? <EOS>
Cities are turning to a variety of sources to recruit contact tracers. North Dakota has tapped graduate public health students, furloughed health care workers, and the national guard. The State of California is considering ways to retrain and reprioritize state workers as contact tracers. However, it is important to note that per CDC guidance, “contact tracing is a specialized skill. To be done effectively, it requires people with the training, supervision, and access to social and medical support for patients and contacts.” Given the number of workers laid off due to COVID-19 and the desire of many to help, public health departments can likely recruit and train contact tracers from a variety of sources.
With support from Bloomberg Philanthropies, Johns Hopkins has launched a free online course on contact tracing here. (Dr. Josh Sharfstein, 5/19/20) <SEP> Have any cities had success shifting employees unable to perform their regular job functions into an alternative work role as contact tracers? <EOS>
This is a big challenge in some states, and it shows the gap in national leadership. My best advice is to stand with people in your healthcare system strongly to call on the state to follow the best-known scientific protocol. Rather than government to government communications, partner with emergency room doctors and nurses. Stand with them and say with one voice that this is a threat to the whole community, healthcare workers are putting themselves and their families at risk, and we need you to take this seriously. (Dr. Josh Sharfstein, 4/4/20)
Over time, as this broadens into a political and economic story, you may want to involve others in sending a message. Depending on your community, you could invite a National Guard member or a respected police chief, for example, to join you in your call for state action. Former state leaders may also be helpful in your efforts (a former Governor or Senator). (Juliette Kayyem, 4/1/20)
The facts are on your side if you're trying to maintain social distancing and reduce the spread of the virus. Those ignoring the facts will find it harder and harder to do so as the virus spreads. To bring them on board sooner, communicate, communicate, communicate. Think critically about the message you want to send, who is the best messenger, and what arguments will make most sense to the agencies you are trying to convince. These are not necessarily the same as the arguments that convinced you. How can you describe the situation to the agency in a way that makes the response you want from them seem like it will be the best possible course for them? (Dutch Leonard, 4/3/20) <SEP> How should local governments engage with state agencies that might not yet understand the gravity of the pandemic or are not following safety protocols? <EOS>
Health workers should take the following precautions:Perform a risk assessment to select the use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), such as a medical mask, eye protection, gloves and gown when caring for the patient.Implement infection prevention and control measures, including hand hygiene.Ensure the room where the patient is cared for is well ventilated, opening windows if necessary.Provide instructions to caregivers and household members on cleaning and disinfection in the home, and on management of waste, laundry and utensils related to the patient.Request the patient to wear a medical mask when providing care or within a 1-metre distance.Request limiting the number of household members during visits and maintaining at least a 1-metre distance.Remove PPE and discard what is disposable, then perform hand hygiene before leaving the home.Make sure that the waste generated from providing care to the patient be placed in strong bags or safety boxes as appropriate, closed completely, disposed as infectious waste and removed from the home. <SEP> What precautions should health workers take when providing care to patients in home settings? <EOS>
Like any other object, coins and banknotes can be potentially contaminated with SARS-CoV-2. A study by van Doremalen et al. published by The New England Journal of Medicine reported that the environmental stability of the causal agent of COVID-19 (i.e. SARS-CoV-2) is up to four hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard, and up to two to three days on stainless steel, albeit with significantly decreased titres. A pre-printed publication by Chin et al. describes detectable levels of infectious virus recovered from banknotes up to two days after inoculation and up to four days on stainless steel. These findings resulted from experiments in a controlled environment and should be interpreted with caution when translated to a real-life environment. In summary, it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 survives on banknotes and coins in real-life conditions; depending on the material properties end environmental conditions, contamination may persist for a variable period of time. <SEP> 1. What is the risk of coins and banknotes to be contaminated with SARS-CoV-2? <EOS>
Businesses with a campus of multiple facilities or a building with multiple offices only need to screen employees from the area of the building where an individual with a suspected or confirmed positive case of COVID-19 has worked. However, businesses should be mindful of bathrooms, breakrooms, building lobbies and other frequently visited areas. The Department of Health recommends temperature screenings be conducted, at all times, however, particularly in those areas of the Commonwealth with high positive case numbers.
Please review the responses above for practices with respect to temperature screening at home. <SEP> Is the requirement to conduct temperature screening applicable to an entire facility/campus or can it be limited to specific at-risk buildings or sections of a building where a probable or confirmed case was identified? <EOS>

As of June 11, 2020, The NIH Treatment Guidelines Panel recommends against the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19, except in a clinical trial. On June 15th, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) revoked the emergency use authorization (EUA) that allowed for chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate to be used to treat certain hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Based on its ongoing analysis of the EUA and emerging scientific data, the FDA determined that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are unlikely to be effective in treating COVID-19 for the authorized uses in the EUA. Additionally, in light of ongoing serious cardiac adverse events and other potential serious side effects, the known and potential benefits of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine no longer outweigh the known and potential risks.
A summary of the FDA review of safety issues with the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to treat hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is now available. This includes reports of serious heart rhythm problems and other safety issues, including blood and lymph system disorders, kidney injuries, and liver problems and failure.
Other therapies, such as investigational antivirals, immunotherapy, and infusion of convalescent plasma are under study, or consideration of being studied, for pre-exposure prophylaxis of, postexposure prophylaxis of, or treatment of COVID-19.  Please see here for more information.

Yes. One of the things we do at well-child visits, besides give vaccines, is to watch a child’s growth and development—height, weight, developmental milestones, etc. We also talk to parents about nutrition, behavior issues, sleeping patterns and a child’s general health and well-being. This helps us look for things that could be going wrong and get your child the care that they need early.  
Especially in these times, when many people are under financial stress, and children are away from their normal routines of school and friends, these visits are a good way to check in on how our families are doing and see if we can refer them to any needed resources. 
You may be able to do a virtual visit, but keep in mind it’s important to track weight and height and have a physical exam, along with getting vaccinations. Check with your doctor on what’s best. <SEP> Should I keep my well-child visits? <EOS>
Many people diagnosed with COVID-19 do not have any symptoms of illness.

The Defense Health Agency issued guidance on the telemental health services, to include IOPs.

Providers may use interactive telecommunications systems for TRICARE-covered diagnostic and treatment services.  Services have to be medically or psychologically necessary, and appropriate. 
Definitions:
    
Medically or psychologically necessary. The frequency, extent, and types of medical services or supplies represent appropriate medical care and are generally accepted by qualified professionals to be reasonable and adequate for the diagnosis and treatment of illness, injury, pregnancy, and mental disorders or that are reasonable and adequate for well-baby care.
Appropriate medical care.
        
(i)   Services performed in connection with the diagnosis or treatment of disease or injury, pregnancy, mental disorder, or well-baby care which are in keeping with the generally accepted norms for medical practice in the United States;
(ii)   The authorized individual professional provider rendering the medical care is qualified to perform such medical services by reason of his or her training and education and is licensed or certified by the state where the service is rendered or appropriate national organization or otherwise meets CHAMPUS standards; and
(iii)   The services are furnished economically. For purposes of this part, “economically” means that the services are furnished in the least expensive level of care or medical environment adequate to provide the required medical care regardless of whether or not that level of care is covered by CHAMPUS.




Partial Hospitalization Program (PHP). PHP is normally 6 hours of more per day of behavioral health services. PHP via telehealth is not a covered benefit.  The DHA is going to make a decision on possible coverage in the future. 
Intensive outpatient services:  TRICARE may cover these services by telehealth during the COVID-19 crisis only.  TRICARE already covers outpatient psychotherapy, crisis therapy, family therapy, and group therapy via telehealth.  It will do so after the crisis is over.

Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP)

This is normally a 2 to <6 hour outpatient program. It takes place in an organized setting, day or evening 
Providers may carry out some IOP services via telehealth (for example, individual psychoeducation, case management, recreational therapy, etc.). Telehealth won’t cover: drug screening, group psychotherapy, and some other services.  
TRICARE policy requires a referral OR prior-authorization for IOP care.
The IOP, or PHP providing IOP services, by telehealth must be at the same intensity and level of services required by those programs per policy.  The provider has to show its offering all components of the IOP via telehealth (e.g., at least 2 hours of services). IOPs have to document all services via telehealth in the medical records and on the claim.


Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) and Opioid Treatment Programs (OTP)

TRICARE may cover MAT and OPT services by telehealth when appropriate.  The MAT and OPT must meet SAMHSA regulations and guidance.  See https://www.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/otp-guidance-20200316.pdf and https://www.samsha.gov/sites/default/files/faqs-for-oud-prescribing-and-dispensing.pdf.
Methadone care shall also follow SAMHSA requirements.


Other outpatient behavioral health telehealth services. 

Providers may offer TRICARE-covered services via telehealth. This may include evaluation and management, psychotherapy, medication management, and more.  A TRICARE-authorized provider may bill for professional services via telehealth if it can’t offer IOP services aren’t at the same intensity or frequency as required for those programs. Providers have to follow existing policies.





If you have questions, contact your regional contractor.
Does TRICARE cover antibody testing for COVID-19?
Many providers offer COVID-19 antibody tests. There’s no solid proof that all tests are accurate or useful. Antibody tests do have the ability to test your blood for the presence of antibodies, and a possible past infection with the coronavirus.    
TRICARE may cover an FDA-approved test if: 

It’s ordered by a TRICARE-authorized provider, and
It’s medically necessary, appropriate, and safe.



TRICARE won’t cover antibody blood tests: 

To see if someone is safe to return to work,

While experience on COVID-19 infection in tuberculosis (TB) patients remains limited, it is anticipated that people ill with both TB and COVID-19 may have poorer treatment outcomes, especially if TB treatment is interrupted. Older age, diabetes and chronic      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are linked with more severe COVID-19 and are      also risk factors for poor outcomes in TB.TB patients should take precautions as advised by health authorities to be protected from COVID-19 and continue their TB treatment as prescribed.People ill with COVID-19 and TB show similar symptoms such as cough, fever and
difficulty breathing. Both diseases attack primarily the lungs and although both
biological agents transmit mainly via close contact, the incubation period from
exposure to disease in TB is longer, often with a slow onset. <SEP> Are people with tuberculosis likely to be at increased risk of COVID-19 infection, illness and death? <EOS>
It depends on where you are in the world and what kind of outbreak or control level the pandemic is at.

Hydroxychloroquine sulfate (HCQ) and chloroquine phosphate (CQ) to treat COVID-19. 
On June 15, 2020, based on continued review of scientific evidence the FDA determined that the statutory criteria for emergency use authorization (EUA) of these meds for COVID-19 are no longer being met.  FDA determined that CQ and HCQ are not likely to be effective in treating COVID-19 for the authorized uses in the EUA. Also, based on ongoing serious cardiac adverse events and other serious side effects, the known and potential benefits of CQ and HCQ no longer outweigh the known and potential risks for the authorized use.

Temperature screening alone, at exit or entry, is not an effective way to stop international spread, since infected individuals may be in incubation period, may not express apparent symptoms early on in the course of the disease, or may dissimulate fever through the use of antipyretics; in addition, such measures require substantial investments for what may bear little benefits. It is more effective to provide prevention recommendation messages to travellers and to collect health declarations at arrival, with travellers’ contact details, to allow for a proper risk assessment and a possible contact tracing of incoming travellers. Event organizers should also consider the capacity to undertake this and the management of suspected cases. However, sporting organizations may have criteria for participation that are stricter than government requirements for Ports of Entry into the country that are based on event risk assessment, including organizers' healthcare capacity.Any additional screening questionnaires for participation in events need to be aligned with public health agencies in the jurisdiction. There is a need to consider how to manage different groups – athletes, officials and spectators, and the large numbers of individuals likely to arrive at a sporting event from many oversea countries – and to follow both host country and WHO travel advice and to assess whether there is difficulty in obtaining accurate information about the travel history of those individuals. <SEP> Should event organizers arrange screening at venues beyond national government requirements for point of entry (PoE)? <EOS>
"The CDC has been a consistent, credible, and reliable guide for our nation for decades, providing clear and science-based guidance on everything from infectious disease to vaccines. That role is vital to our collective public health and it must continue. This 180-degree reversal of COVID-19 testing guidelines is reckless, and not based on science and has the potential to do long-term damage to the institution's reputation.
"CDC and HHS have not shared their scientific rationale for this change in policy, which substitutes sound science-based public health guidance with the President's misinformation. This abrupt and ill-informed shift threatens the robust testing regimes our states have worked tirelessly to stand up with our federal partners.
"Health experts recommend testing close contacts of individuals with COVID-19 to identify and prevent asymptomatic spread. This type of robust testing by our states has been a key factor in our success so far to flatten the curve in the tristate area.

School outbreaks have not been a prominent feature in the COVID-19 pandemic, mostly due to the fact that the majority of children do not develop symptoms when infected with the virus, or develop a very mild form of the disease.
No evidence has been found to suggest that children are the primary drivers of SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission. However, research has shown that children can become infected, and spread the virus to adults while they are symptomatic. <SEP> 1. How likely are children to catch and transmit the virus in school settings? <EOS>
No. This provision only requires that you designate someone at the facility who is responsible for monitoring

Yes, some young adults have suffered strokes after getting coronavirus. 
“The virus seems to be causing increased clotting in the large arteries, leading to severe stroke,” said Dr. Thomas Oxley, a neurosurgeon at Mount Sinai Health System in New York.
“Our report shows a seven-fold increase in incidence of sudden stroke in young patients during the past two weeks,” he said. “Most of these patients have no past medical history and were at home with either mild symptoms (or in two cases, no symptoms) of Covid.” <SEP> Is it true young people with coronavirus are also having blood clots and strokes? <EOS>
President Trump signed a bipartisan $2 trillion economic relief plan to offer assistance to tens of millions of American households affected by the coronavirus pandemic. Its components include stimulus payments to individuals, expanded unemployment coverage, student loan changes, different retirement account rules and more. Most adults received $1,200, although some received less, according to income. 
But as with most coronavirus relief packages, questions remain. Some people received them on debit cards, and the envelopes look like junk mail. Don’t throw them out.
Think you received a payment by mistake? Say, for a deceased relative? Don’t spend the money. The Internal Revenue Service will likely ask for it back come tax time in 2021.
If you haven’t received yours yet, don’t panic. Many people have already received their payments, but many others are still waiting or wondering. There are a lot of reasons you could be among them, even if the government has removed some of the hurdles it initially set up.
Try the I.R.S. Get My Payment tool again. It’s supposed to help people figure out when and how their money might be arriving. The  I.R.S. is updating the information once each day, usually in the middle of the night.
Make sure you filed the right paperwork. If you haven’t had to file a return because your gross income did not exceed $12,200 ($24,400 for married couples), you still qualify for a payment. But if you’re not a recipient of S.S.I. or V.A. benefits, you should fill out a special form for non-filers.
Also, be careful of scammers. <SEP> I have questions about my stimulus check. <EOS>
In accordance with direction from the Office of the Chief of Human Resources Officer (OCHRO), Leave With Pay for Other Reasons (code 699) will apply in COVID-specific situations, as the circumstances that prevent employees from reporting to work are not directly attributable to them. This special leave provision will be re-evaluated in late June, in accordance with public health advisories and central agency guidance.
An employee can request leave with pay for other reasons if:

They live with/care for a member of the vulnerable population;
They are experiencing child care challenges;
They are ready and able to work but their duties do not lend themselves to working remotely;
They have been diagnosed with or have a presumptive case of COVID-19

We expect that employees continue to adopt a good faith approach in using this leave, keeping in mind their important roles in providing services to the Defence Team. <SEP> As a Manager / Supervisor, when should I grant leave with pay for other reasons (code 699)? <EOS>
Right now, it appears that COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, causes more cases of severe disease and more deaths than the seasonal flu. People over age 85 have the highest risk of fatality and children under 19, the lowest, but this could change as more people are tested and trends become clearer. If, over time, widespread testing reveals more mild, non-fatal cases of COVID-19, the death rate will go down.

No. The first two workweeks of EFMLA are unpaid. An employee may, but is not required to, supplement that unpaid time with Paid COVID-19 Leave (School Leave). The employee can instead choose to save their Paid COVID-19 Leave hours for another Paid COVID-19 Leave use (Health Leave or Care Leave). The employee can supplement the first two workweeks of EFMLA leave with vacation leave or compensatory time, or have the first two weeks of EFMLA leave entirely unpaid. However, if the employee does take Paid COVID-19 School Leave, that time must run concurrently with EFMLA. In other words, an employee cannot extend EFMLA to 14 weeks by taking the first 2 weeks of EFMLA leave unpaid (or vacation/comp time), 10 weeks of EFMLA leave paid, and 80 additional hours of Paid COVID-19 School Leave. <SEP> Does an employee have to take Paid COVID-19 School Leave even though they are taking EFMLA leave?

School outbreaks are not a prominent feature of the COVID-19 pandemic, at least partially due to the fact that the majority of children do not develop symptoms when infected with the virus, and therefore may not have been detected.
When appropriate measures are taken to reduce the possibility for the virus to spread, it is unlikely that school settings play a role in transmission. Moreover, schools are an essential part of society and children’s lives.
Broad school closures should be seen as a last resort, and only after other significant measures have been put in place within the community to contain the spread of the disease. Schools should coordinate with local public health authorities to determine whether closure is necessary. <SEP> 5.

In a situation where there is no choice — such as if the grandparent lives with the grandchildren — then the family should do everything they can to try to limit the risk of COVID-19. The grandchildren should be isolated as much as possible, as should the parents, so that the overall family risk is as low as possible. Everyone should wash their hands very frequently throughout the day, and surfaces should be wiped clean frequently. Physical contact should be limited to the absolutely necessary; as wonderful as it can be to snuggle with Grandma or Grandpa, now is not the time. <SEP> I live with my children and grandchildren.

Yes, alcohol-based hand sanitizer kills the virus (known as SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19.  CDC recommends use of hand sanitizer that contains 60% or more alcohol.  It takes at least 30 seconds for hand sanitizer to kill the virus.  Pour hand sanitizer (about the size of a quarter) into one hand.  Rub hands together for a minimum of 30 seconds (longer is fine) so that the gel gets all over hands, in between fingers, on fingertips, under nails, etc.  Then, let hands dry on their own. Do not wipe away hand sanitizer gel. <SEP> Does alcohol-based hand sanitizer kill the virus that causes COVID-19?  How long does it take to kill the virus? <EOS>
Contraception and family planning information and services are life-saving and important at all times. Sexual activity does not cease with the COVID-19 pandemic, it is therefore crucial to ensure that people are able to access rights-based services and information to initiate and / or continue use of contraception. By preventing unintended pregnancies, contraception helps to protect girls and women from the negative health consequences of unintended pregnancies, which can save their lives. Contraception reduces the need for abortion, meaning that women and girls are less at risk of unsafe abortion, which again can be lifesaving.  Condoms, when used consistently and correctly, help to prevent both unintended pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections (including HIV).  In addition, by preventing the negative health consequences associated with unintended pregnancies, unsafe abortion and sexually transmitted infections (including HIV), contraception can help alleviate additional pressure on already-stretched health systems which are working hard to address COVID-19. <SEP> Why is providing contraception/ family planning, as well as family planning services and information, important during the COVID-19 pandemic? <EOS>
People living with HIV with advanced disease, those with low CD4 and high viral load and those who are not taking antiretroviral treatment have an increased risk of infections and related complications in general.  It is unknown if the immunosuppression of HIV will put a person at greater risk for COVID-19, thus, until more is known, additional precautions for all people with advanced HIV or poorly controlled HIV, should be employed[1],[2].At present there is no evidence that the risk of infection or complications of COVID-19 is different among people living with HIV who are clinically and immunologically stable on antiretroviral treatment when compared with the general population.  Some people living with HIV may have known risk factors for COVID-19 complications, such as diabetes, hypertension and other noncommunicable diseases and as such may have increased risk of COVID-19 unrelated to HIV.  We know that during the SARS and MERS outbreaks there were only a few case reports of mild disease among people living with HIV.  To date, there is a case report of a person living with HIV who had COVID-19 and recovered[3] and a small study on risk factors and antiretrovirals used among people living with HIV with COVID-19 from China.  This study reported similar rates of COVID-19 disease as compared to the entire population and increased risk with older age, but not with low CD4, high viral load level or antiretroviral regimen[4]. Current clinical data suggest the main mortality risk factors are linked to older age and other comorbidities including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and hypertension. Some very healthy people have also developed severe disease from the coronavirus infection[5].  PLHIV are advised to take the same precautions as the general population[6],[7]: wash hands oftencough etiquette physical distancingseek medical care if symptomaticself-isolation if in contact with someone with COVID-19 and other actions per the government response   People living with HIV who are taking antiretroviral drugs should ensure that they have at least 30 days and up to 6-month supply of medicines and ensure that their vaccinations are up to date (influenza and pneumococcal vaccines). Adequate supplies of medicines to treat co-infections and comorbidities and addiction should also be ensured. <SEP> Are people living with HIV at increased risk of being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19? <EOS>

It is important for Health Care Providers (HCP) to perform hand hygiene before and after removing PPE.

Self-care interventions provide individuals, families and communities with a way to manage their own health at home. Some self-care actions, such as washing your hands and practicing good respiratory hygiene measures that protect you from COVID-19, do not need you to meet with a health worker. Other self-care interventions, such as obtaining a prescription for hormonal contraception and abortion medications or counselling during pregnancy, will need interaction with a health worker. Such support can be provided in different ways during this pandemic and will depend on the healthcare arrangements in place where you live; for example, some medicines are available over-the-counter without a prescription in a pharmacy, or counseling and important information during pregnancy and when caring for a newborn can be provided over the phone or online. <SEP> Do I need to see a health worker for self care actions? <EOS>
Whether the presence of detectable but low concentrations of viral RNA after clinical recovery represents the presence of potentially infectious virus is unknown. Based on experience with other viruses, it is unlikely that such persons pose an important infectious risk to others. However, whether this is true for SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been definitively established.
After the onset of illness, the detectable viral burden usually declines. After a week or more, anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin becomes detectable and then antibody levels increase. Some of these antibodies may prevent the virus from infecting cells in cell culture. A decline in viral RNA is associated with a decreased ability to isolate live virus. For most patients with COVID-19, efforts to isolate live virus from upper respiratory tract specimens have been unsuccessful when specimens are collected more than 10 days after illness onset. Recovery of live virus between 10 and 20 days after symptom onset has been documented in some persons with severe COVID-19; in some cases, these persons were in an immunocompromised state.
Persons who have tested persistently or recurrently positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA have, in some cases, had their signs and symptoms of COVID-19 improve. When viral isolation in tissue culture has been attempted in such persons in South Korea and the United States, live virus has not been isolated. There is no evidence to date that clinically recovered persons with persistent or recurrent detection of viral RNA have transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to others.
Despite these observations, it’s not possible to conclude that all persons with persistent or recurrent detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA are no longer infectious. There is no firm evidence that the antibodies that develop in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection are protective. If these antibodies are protective, it’s not known what antibody levels are needed to  protect against reinfection.
These data and experience with other viral respiratory infections indicate that most persons recovered from COVID-19 who test persistently or recurrently positive by RT-PCR are likely no longer infectious. Isolation and precautions may be discontinued for persons with COVID-19  10 days after symptom onset (the date on which symptoms first began, including non-respiratory symptoms), provided their fever has resolved for at least 24 hours, without the use of fever-reducing medications, and their other symptoms have improved. For some persons with severe or critical illness, or who are severely immunocompromised, isolation and precautions may be maintained for up to 20 days after symptom onset. <SEP> Are clinically recovered persons infectious to others if they test persistently or recurrently positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA? <EOS>

It is an important reminder that in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, everyone, regardless of the use of masks, should:avoid groups of people and crowded spaces;maintain physical distance of at least 1 meter from other people, especially from those who are sick;clean your hands frequently, using an alcohol-based hand rub if hands are not visibly dirty, or soap and water;cover your nose and mouth with a bent elbow or paper tissue when coughing or sneezing, dispose of the tissue and clean your hands immediately after use;refrain from touching your mouth, nose, and eyes.Above all, stay informed of the progress of the disease, pay attention to local authorities and their recommendations, and follow and encourage best practices. <SEP> What are the key measures all people should do to protect themselves and others in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic? <EOS>
In general, transport and movement of a patient with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection outside of their room should be limited to medically essential purposes. If being transported outside of the room, such as to radiology, healthcare personnel (HCP) in the receiving area should be notified in advance of transporting the patient. For transport, the patient should wear a facemask or cloth face covering (if tolerated) to contain secretions and be covered with a clean sheet.
If transport personnel must prepare the patient for transport (e.g., transfer them to the wheelchair or gurney), transport personnel should wear all recommended PPE (gloves, a gown, respiratory protection that is at least as protective as a fit tested NIOSH-certified disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirator or facemask—if a respirator is not available—and eye protection [i.e., goggles or disposable face shield that covers the front and sides of the face]). This recommendation is needed because these interactions typically involve close, often face-to-face, contact with the patient in an enclosed space (e.g., patient room). Once the patient has been transferred to the wheelchair or gurney (and prior to exiting the room), transporters should remove their gown and gloves and perform hand hygiene.
The transporter should continue to wear a respirator or facemask.  The continued use of eye protection by the transporter is also recommended if there is potential that the patient might not be able to tolerate their facemask or cloth face covering for the duration of transport.   Additional PPE should not be required unless there is an anticipated need to provide medical assistance during transport (e.g., helping the patient replace a dislodged facemask).
After arrival at their destination, receiving personnel (e.g., in radiology) and the transporter (if assisting with transfer) should perform hand hygiene and wear all recommended PPE. If still wearing their original respirator or facemask and eye protection, the transporter should take care to avoid self-contamination when donning the remainder of the recommended PPE. This cautious approach will be refined and updated as more information becomes available and as response needs change in the United States.

One of the lessons from this virus is that we are all connected. In China, they took extraordinary measures, ordering close to 800 million people to stay at home for a month and contact-tracing 700,000 people. But when they re-opened to international travel, they began getting 100-200 cases a day coming in from other parts of the world. To reduce transmission, we recommend a 14-day self-quarantine for travelers from regions where transmission levels are high, such as New York City. (Dr. Tom Frieden, 4/2/20)
On March 20th, the United States and Mexico agreed to restrict nonessential travel across their border to slow the spread of the virus.

The travel restrictions do no impede trade or commerce, including essential goods such as food, fuel, and medical supplies.

Maybe. Staff in some occupations work with people at higher risk for contracting the disease, like in health care, or long-term care facilities. Or, they have more frequent contact with members of the general public who may not be social distancing or wearing face coverings, like in the retail or hospitality (food/hotel) industries.
Most health care workers and first responders are recommended to be tested once every 4 weeks, and most other critical infrastructure personnel are recommended to be tested at least once a month, however your employer may decide you should be tested more frequently.

1. If HCP have a high-risk exposure within 3 months of their initial infection to a patient with SARS-CoV-2 infection, should they be restricted from work for 14 days after the exposure?
CDC has posted guidance addressing risk assessment and work exclusion for HCP with potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Due to their often extensive and close contact with vulnerable individuals, this guidance recommends conservative management of occupationally exposed HCP.
Review of currently available evidence suggests that most individuals do not become re-infected within 3 months of resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Re-infection has not been definitively identified to date. Several studies have documented persistent detection of virus using PCR after recovery, some even with redevelopment or new symptoms. However, people who were newly symptomatic or tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 after recent resolution of an acute infection did not appear to be infectious to others. Testing of asymptomatic individuals during this 3-month period is complicated by the fact that some people have detectable virus from their prior infection during this period; a positive test during this period may more likely result from a prior infection rather than a new infection that poses risk for transmission. In light of this, exposed HCP could continue to work, while monitoring for development of symptoms. If symptoms develop, exposed HCP should be assessed and potentially tested for SARS-Cov-2, if an alternate etiology is not identified. Some facilities might still choose to institute work exclusion for HCP following a high-risk exposure.
2. If HCP within 3 months of their initial infection develop symptoms consistent with COVID-19, should they be excluded from work and retested?
HCP within 3 months of a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who develop symptoms consistent with COVID-19 should be evaluated to identify potential alternative etiologies for their symptoms. If an alternate etiology for the symptoms cannot be identified, they may need to be retested for SARS-CoV-2 infection with the understanding that a positive viral test could represent residual viral particles from the previous infection, rather than new infection. Decisions about the need for and duration of work exclusion should be based upon their suspected diagnosis (e.g., influenza, SARS-CoV-2 infection).
3. Do HCP within 3 months of their initial infection need to wear all recommended personal protective equipment (PPE) when caring for patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection? For example, if there are limited respirators, should respirators be prioritized for HCP who have not been previously infected?
Regardless of suspected or confirmed immunity, healthcare personnel should always wear all recommended PPE when caring for patients. In situations of PPE shortages, facilities should refer to CDC strategies for optimizing PPE supply. However, as with other infectious diseases (e.g., measles), allocation of available PPE should not be based on whether HCP have been previously infected or have evidence of immunity.
4. Should HCP within 3 months of their initial infection be preferentially assigned to care for patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection?
While individuals who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection might develop some protective immunity, the duration and extent of such immunity are not known. Staffing decisions should be based on usual facility practices. Any HCP assigned to care for patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, regardless of history of infection, should follow all recommended infection prevention and control practices when providing care. Guidance on mitigating staff shortages is also available. <SEP> Questions addressing the proper handling of healthcare personnel (HCP) who have clinically recovered from SARS-CoV-2 Infection, but are still within 3 months of onset of their prior infection. <EOS>
Yes. To help us protect you, other patients, and our staff, we require everyone entering our facilities to wear a cloth face covering.
Please bring your own face covering with you if you can. If you can't, we'll provide you with one to wear during your visit.
If you wear an oxygen mask, you don't need to wear a face covering. We'll work with you to keep you and others safe, and may ask you to wait in a designated space until your appointment time.
For more information on how to wear, sanitize, and make a cloth face covering, go to the CDC website. <SEP> Do I need to wear a mask when I go to a VA hospital or other location? <EOS>

Many experts and ethicists agree: The only way to enable everyone to vote is to turn to a mail-in ballot system, because going to the polls could be a matter of life or death.
President Trump alleged that voting by mail could lead to voter fraud — despite being used for years in Democratic and Republican states without controversy. But states are opening the door to the system, and some opposition to letting voters mail in their ballots has dissipated.
Republican opposition to the system seemed driven by the conviction that an increase in mail voting would benefit Democrats. But the reality is far less clear. The pandemic is also affecting who can vote — millions of people who would ordinarily register or update their registrations in a presidential election year have not been able to do so. 
The drop in registration has the potential to depress participation in a November presidential election that has been widely expected to break all records for turnout. <SEP> What is the deal with voting by mail? <EOS>
​In recognition of the Pennsylvania Department of Health, and CDC information concerning social distancing, the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry Office of Workers' Compensation would like to remind employers, employees, and healthcare providers that telemedicine and virtual care may be sought by workers sustaining injuries and illness for treatment related to a compensable work injury.Yesterday (3/18/2020), The Pennsylvania Department of State's (DOS) Bureau of Professional and Occupational Affairs (BPOA) released guidance clarifying that health care professionals licensed under any of BPOA's licensing boards can provide services to patients via telemedicine during the COVID-19 emergency. Telemedicine visits can be used for new injuries or ongoing treatment of injuries sustained in the workplace. <SEP> ​Can I receive telemedicine for a workplace injury or illness under workers' compensation? <EOS>
Yes. If the outpatient setting can follow CDC’s infection prevention and control precautions as follows:

Place patients who may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 in a private room with the door closed. An AIIR room should be used if aerosol generating procedures will be performed, and
Use gloves, a gown, a fit-tested N95 respirator or a facemask with a face shield if an N95 is not available, and goggles or face shield

Keep a log of personnel who cared for such patients.
If the patient cannot be evaluated using CDC’s recommended infection prevention and control precautions, the outpatient practice will need to arrange referral and transport of the masked patient to a setting where this can be done. Inform the receiving facility about any patient(s) who might have COVID-19 before the patient is transferred to another facility. <SEP> Can people suspected of having COVID-19 be evaluated safely in an outpatient setting? <EOS>

The CDC recommends that in communities like King County and Washington State, where there is significant community-based transmission, all individuals cover their noses and mouths with a cloth face covering to prevent spreading COVID-19.
We know people with COVID-19 may not show symptoms and can still spread the virus to others. Recent research indicates wearing a face covering can significantly reduce the spread and incidence of COVID-19.
We have made progress slowing the spread of COVID-19 in our communities, but most people do not have immunity to the disease and remain susceptible. As a community, a surge of new cases could make many more people ill and overwhelm our health care system’s ability to treat those with serious complications of the disease and non-COVID related emergencies. <SEP> 9.

 Yes. Pursuant Executive Order  202.11 and, in response to COVID-19, and its potential impact on communities’ and  hospitals’ access to pharmacy services due to potential pharmacists and/or  other pharmacy staff positive exposures, pharmacists and pharmacy staff are  permitted to engage in the processing of prescriptions  and medication orders from an unregistered site, until the expiration of  Executive Order 202.  
It should be noted that SED approval of a pharmacy’s technology  solutions for remote processing is not required. However, any pharmacy engaged  in remote processing must, upon SED’s request, be able to justify and document how  its technology meets the requirements of this guidance, as well as any  applicable laws and regulations.  
Pharmacy staff is permitted to perform remote order  entry and remote order entry verification under the following conditions,  consistent with current pharmacy requirements.  For pharmacists, remote  processing does not include the dispensing of a drug.  

If performing remote processing in New York, the pharmacist must be a  New York-licensed and registered pharmacist, either employed or a contract  employee of a registered New York registered pharmacy.
A pharmacist providing personal supervision for remote order entry and  remote order entry verification processing via technology must be: (1) readily  available to answer questions of a pharmacy intern or unlicensed staff, under  his/her supervision; and (2) fully responsible for the practice and/or accuracy  of the pharmacy intern’s and/or unlicensed staff’s work.
Each pharmacist and pharmacy intern practicing and engaged in remote  order entry and remote order verification must have current and appropriate credentials  with the State of New York as defined, but, not limited to sections 6801,  6802, 6805 and 6806 of Education Law.
At the present time,  existing staffing ratio requirements (relative to the ratio of a pharmacist to pharmacy  interns and unlicensed staff) must be maintained in accordance with the applicable  laws and regulations, except as stated in E.O. 202.10, which suspended 10 NYCRR  §405.2(3)  to the extent necessary to permit general hospitals affected by the disaster  emergency to maintain adequate staffing.

Protected Heath Information (PHI) 

Patient and medication       information must be processed and maintained in a manner that protects       each patient’s PHI.
Physical PHI must not       leave the registered pharmacy premises.
PHI accessed during remote       order entry and remote order verification must be protected from all       routes of accidental disclosure. 
Failure to appropriately       protect PHI is a violation of the Health Insurance Portability and       Accountability Act (HIPAA) and may result in disciplinary action.

Prescription Images

Prescriptions must be able       to be accessed, at all times, during the data entry process, whether it be       from within the registered pharmacy premises or from a remote       location.
An audit trail that       identifies each appropriately credentialed pharmacist, pharmacy intern,       and unlicensed staff involved in the receipt, entry, verification and       dispensing of a prescription must be maintained daily and made available       upon SED’s request. Such audit trail must include the identity of       each pharmacist conducting final verification of each prescription during       the dispensing process. 

Drug Utilization Reviews (DURs)

DURs can be done from a       remote location or from within the registered pharmacy premises, but only       by an appropriately credentialed pharmacist or pharmacy intern personally       supervised by the appropriately credentialed pharmacist. 
A record of each DUR must       be maintained that details the identity of each appropriately credentialed       pharmacist or pharmacy intern personally supervised by the appropriately       credentialed pharmacist conducting each DUR. 

Quality Assurance Reports

Any and all Quality       Assurance reports must be maintained within the registered pharmacy       premises where the respective prescription was accepted for dispensing and       from which such prescription was ultimately dispensed for delivery to the       patient or patient’s representative.
The  registered pharmacy at which remote order entry and remote order entry  verification is conducted by appropriately credentialed individuals  (pharmacists, interns, and unlicensed personnel) must be  documented in any and all quality assurance reports, when the prescription is  dispensed with the involvement of appropriately credentialed individuals from  multiple registered, New York Licensed pharmacies.

The appropriately credentialed  pharmacist conducting the final verification of a prescription, during the  dispensing process, is responsible for the dispensing of such prescription in  its totality, as referenced, but, not limited to the guidance provided above. <SEP> Is there any guidance regarding  the remote processing of prescriptions and medication orders from an  unregistered site, during the COVID-19 health emergency? <EOS>
Travellers should self-monitor for any symptoms for 14 days after arrival. Report any symptoms and your travel history to local health facilities and follow national protocols. If you are confirmed to have COVID-19, you will be placed in isolation in a health facility or in self-isolation at home, depending on the country’s policies, and asked to provide a list of your contacts in the last 14 days.

there has been community spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 in your area. <SEP> How do I know if I have COVID-19 or the regular flu? <EOS>
All businesses are strongly encouraged to take as many precautions as possible to ensure employee safety. Disease transmission between employees is likely when working closely together. The U.S. Department of Labor Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) provides similar recommendations for or businesses in regard to social distancing, including the “every other register” recommendation. However, if all other public health practices have been implemented, including limiting in-person shopping, limiting the number of customers to reduce crowding, installing shields or barriers, performing regular cleaning and designating a specific shopping time for high risk individuals, then a business may consider opening checkout lanes that are next to each other. <SEP> Retail stores with multiple checkout lanes are required to limit use to every other register and rotate registers and clean hourly.

Businesses are encouraged to provide face coverings for all workers to ensure compliance with the Executive Order. If an employer requires that all workers wear the same uniform face covering, such as one with their business logo on it, they will likely purchase the face covering and provide it to workers. However, the law provides that an employer can deduct from a worker’s wages the cost of a uniform so long as it does not reduce the worker’s pay below the minimum wage for hours worked. The amount of the deduction for a face covering may not exceed the cost of the face covering to the employer. The maximum deduction for all items that are part of a uniform allowed by law is $50. If the employer provides the face covering and deducts the cost of the face covering from the worker’s wages, the employer must reimburse the worker the full amount deducted for the face covering when the worker’s employment ends and the worker returns the face covering to the employer. 
If an employer chooses not to provide the face covering, workers are responsible for acquiring their own face covering and wearing it while at work to comply with the Executive Order. <SEP> Who provides and pays for the face covering if workers have to wear them? <EOS>
The U.S. President issued Coronavirus Guidelines for America for individuals to do their part to slow the spread of COVID-19, which include avoiding social gatherings in groups of more than 10 people. The Governor of Virginia announced his support of this guideline for both social gatherings and businesses. The rule of 10 previously applied to fitness centers, restaurants, and movie theaters, and law enforcement was permitted to cite non-compliant businesses with a misdemeanor. Residents were also encouraged to limit their social gatherings to less than 10 people. As Virginia has moved into Phase I, II, and III, recommendations about group gatherings and the number of people permitted in business establishments has changed. For parts of the state that have moved into Phase II, gatherings of up to 50 people are permitted, but social distancing should be maintained. In Phase III, gatherings of up to 250 people are permitted, but social distancing should be maintained.

To help protect each visitor’s health and the health of staff, family members, or friends inside the facility, contact visits are discouraged during the COVID-19 pandemic. You should not visit a correctional or detention facility if you:

Have had COVID-19 or COVID-19 symptoms and have not yet met the criteria to discontinue home isolation
Have been in contact with someone who has had COVID-19 in the last 14 days
Have been in contact with someone who is suspected of having COVID-19 in the last 14 days

Prior to a planned visit, you should make sure that visitation has not been suspended and review the facility’s rules about visits. If there is someone in the facility who has COVID-19, visitors might not be allowed to enter the facility. Some facilities may arrange for non-contact visits when possible, and staff may screen and perform temperature checks on all visitors. You should also wear cloth face coverings. Wearing cloth face coverings may be difficult for people with sensory, cognitive, or behavioral issues and is not recommended for children under 2 years or anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the covering without assistance. <SEP> Is it ok for me to visit? <EOS>
Medicolegal death investigators and other medical examiner or coroner office staff receiving reports of deaths should inquire about whether the decedent was COVID-19 positive, showed signs or symptoms of COVID-19 infection, and if the decedent had any risk factors for COVID-19 exposure. Investigators may talk with the local health department, family physician, family members, or others who lived with the decedent to help answer these questions. If there is no one to answer these questions (e.g., unwitnessed death, person lived alone, no medical history), investigators should take precautions as if the decedent was a known COVID-19 case. Current guidance on signs, symptoms, and other risk factors for COVID-19 can be found on the CDC Coronavirus Disease 2019 website. <SEP> What initial information should medicolegal death investigators gather during a death investigation to assess the potential risk for COVID-19? <EOS>
Travellers should adhere to strict hygiene measures, wash hands with soap and water regularly, and/or use alcohol-based hand sanitisers. Touching the face with unwashed hands should be avoided. Travellers should avoid contact with sick persons, in particular those with respiratory symptoms and fever. It should be emphasised that older people and those with underlying health conditions should take these precautionary measures very seriously. Travellers who develop any symptoms during or after travel should self-isolate; those developing acute respiratory symptoms within 14 days upon return should be advised to seek immediate medical advice, ideally by phone first to their national healthcare provider. <SEP> 2.

“If you don’t have to use the public restroom, don’t,” said microbiologist Ali Nouri, president of the Federation of American Scientists. But he acknowledged that’s not always possible: “Sometimes when you gotta go, you gotta go.”
Close contact with others is the most significant risk in a public restroom, Nouri said. So if there’s a single-person bathroom available that doesn’t have multiple stalls, using that might be best. 
If you do use a multi-stall public restroom, Nouri offers the following tips: 

Use paper towels to dry your hands, not the hand dryer. Air dryers can spread viral particles around the room. And paper towels have been shown to remove residual viral particles more effectively than air.
Don’t use your freshly washed hands to turn off the water with the germ-laden faucet handle. Instead, use a paper towel to turn off the water and open the bathroom door. Throw away the paper towel immediately afterward.
Wear a face mask. “Masks are one of the most effective ways to stop human-to-human transmission,” Nouri said. “If people in a public bathroom are not wearing masks, think twice before going in.” 
If the restroom looks crowded, wait until it clears out, if you can.  “You’re reducing the risk of inhaling aerosolized particles from other people,” Nouri said. <SEP> How safe are public restrooms? <EOS>

Cover your mouth and your nose. Both your mouth and nose can spread respiratory droplets. “If the mask isn’t big enough to cover your nose and mouth, it’s not a good choice,” Glucoft says. 
Make sure it fits. Your mask should be comfortable and should not restrict your breathing. That said, it needs to fit snugly, especially around your cheeks and the bridge of your nose. 

Tip: If your glasses fog when you’re wearing your mask, your mask does not fit well. Too much air is escaping. 

Don’t fidget with your mask. “I see people manipulating their masks a lot,” she notes. “Treat the mask like it’s dirty. If you have to reposition the mask, wash your hands first.” 
Wash your hands before you put your mask on. You should also wash your hands after you take the mask off. Remove the mask by the ear loops. Don’t touch the front of the mask, which is the most likely area to contain germs.  
Wash your mask often. It’s best to have several masks, so you always have a clean one ready. Wash cloth masks in the washing machine, just as you’d wash your clothes. Any laundry soap is fine. 
Take it with you. Don’t leave home without a mask. Keep a clean mask in your car.  
Don’t pull your mask down to talk. It’s sometimes hard for people to hear you when you talk with a mask. But removing your mask to speak defeats the purpose. If you are talking to someone and are within 6 feet of that person, keep your mask on. 
Don’t forget about the kids. Look for smaller masks that will fit your child’s face. Note: N95 masks are not intended for kids, and children and babies under age 2 should not wear a mask. It could make it hard for them to breathe. <SEP> Tips for mask wear and care <EOS>
People with COVID-19 can still spread the virus even if they don’t have any symptoms. If you were around someone who had COVID-19, it is critical that you stay home and away from others for 14 days from the last day that you were around that person. Staying home and away from others at all times helps your health department in the fight against COVID-19 and helps protect you, your family, and your community. <SEP> I was recently around someone who has COVID-19, but I feel fine. Why should I stay at home? <EOS>
Continued research around the world aims to better understand the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person. At this time, it seems that respiratory droplets are the primary driver of disease transmission. The possibility of aerosol or fecal-oral transmission has been proposed, but is not thought to contribute significantly to disease transmission. It is not yet known if other body fluids from an infected person, such as vomit, urine, breast milk, or semen can contain viable, infectious SARS-CoV-2. Please see CDC’s website on How COVID-19 Spreads for more information. <SEP> How is COVID-19 transmitted? <EOS>
To date, there has been no evidence of transfusion-based transmission of the COVID-19 virus (SARS-CoV-2), nor of the related coronavirus SARS-CoV-1. The AABB says that "individuals are not at risk of contracting COVID-19 through the blood donation process or via a blood transfusion, since respiratory viruses are generally not known to be transmitted by donation or transfusion."
Moreover, routine screening of blood donors prevents individuals with clinical respiratory infections such as COVID-19, or even those who have knowingly contacted someone suspected of having COVID-19, from donating blood.
Evidence of viral RNA in infected people's blood has been reported in their plasma; however, this does not necessarily mean that infectious virus can be spread via blood. Research regarding the presence of virus in blood plasma, serum, and lymphocytes is underway, as are the development of tests that could identify infectious virus in the blood.

It is possible to get started on contact tracing before there's widespread testing. You could talk to your health department about setting up reporting of suspect cases and starting contact. If someone calls a call center and says, “I'm coughing, I have a fever and I can't smell,” then public health officials might be able to consider them as positive and start to trace their contacts. Even if you can't do that with everyone who calls and says they're coughing, you can get started with some of those presumptive cases. (Dr. Josh Sharfstein, 4/21/20)
Example: For cities and counties experiencing a surge in cases, contact tracing for every person has become difficult. Nassau County in New York has prioritized contact tracing for people who have had direct exposure to a lot of people, such as food handlers or residents in group homes. Cities and counties that may not have full contact tracing capacity can tell those who test positive to alert contacts on their own. <SEP> Can we do or prepare for contact tracing before there is widespread access to rapid testing? <EOS>

If a customer refuses to wear a cloth face covering for non-medical reasons, then workers may decline entry to the individual.
Policies may be adopted that require NJ TRANSIT and private carrier staff to wear gloves, in addition to regular hand hygiene. Where a business requires its staff to wear gloves while at the worksite, the business must provide such gloves to staff.
Require infection control practices, such as coughing and sneezing etiquette, and proper tissue usage and disposal;
Arrange for contactless pay options across all modes of transportation wherever feasible. Such policies shall, wherever possible, consider populations that do not have access to internet service;
Arrange for back door entry on buses wherever feasible, and take seats out of service near the bus operator to allow for proper social distancing from the bus operator wherever feasible;
For NJ TRANSIT: Require frequent sanitization of high-touch areas in stations, like restrooms, waiting areas, credit card machines, and keypads;
Place conspicuous signage and throughout train cars, buses, light rail and Access Link vehicles alerting workers and customers to the required six feet of physical distance and for NJ TRANSIT, at stations;

What mitigation measures are NJ TRANSIT and private carriers adopting? <EOS>
As the United States moves into the next phase of the pandemic, efforts should be focused on safely reopening with caution until a vaccine is developed and/or effective medications for treating the disease become available. Efforts should also be focused on taking precautionary steps to prevent a dramatic spike in cases and a second wave. The CDC has warned that a resurgence of COVID-19 next winter could hit the United States health care system even harder than the original outbreak. If the virus’ second wave coincides with the start of the flu season, then the nation’s health care system will likely be even more overwhelmed and under-supplied than it has been this spring. 
Mayors should make a point to emphasize these very real concerns to their communities, especially as we approach summer and people become increasingly eager to congregate and resume normal activities. Mayors should reiterate as often and through as many channels as possible the steps residents should take to avoid a second wave. First, social distancing must be maintained this summer and into this fall as more businesses and public spaces reopen. Second, the country needs to continue to scale up testing and contact tracing to quickly identify and isolate cases before they create larger outbreaks. Finally, health officials must spend the summer months persuading citizens about the importance of getting flu shots in the fall in order to minimize the number of flu-related hospitalizations. (Dutch Leonard, 5/27/20) <SEP> As cities look beyond the initial outbreak, what types of messaging should mayors employ to mitigate the impact of a second wave? <EOS>
Yes. It is possible to test positive for the flu (as well as other respiratory infections) and COVID-19 at the same time. <SEP> Is it possible to have the flu and COVID-19 at the same time? <EOS>
While many experts are recommending 14 days of self-quarantine for those who are concerned that they may be infected, the decision to discontinue these measures should be made on a case-by-case basis, in consultation with your doctor and state and local health departments. The decision will be based on the risk of infecting others. <SEP> When can I discontinue my self-quarantine? <EOS>
The answer depends to some degree on the number of cases, the relative ease of finding contacts and on the resources available to contact tracers. In one city of China, they required nearly 1 contact tracer for every 1,000 people in the community. There's contact elicitation (finding out from the index case who their contacts are), then there's connecting with each of those contacts, who may be more or less easy to find. Sometimes an individual patient can infect a lot of people. In those super-spreading events, we really need to go wide, and work intensively to find all of the cases and contacts. There may be electronic tools that will make the process more efficient, but that's at least a month or two away and not yet proven. These tools are NOT the same as what is being discussed as finding contacts by using cell phone proximity, nor are they the same as tracking the location of contacts and cases to see if they are adhering to quarantine and isolation. (Dr. Tom Frieden, 4/14/20) <SEP> How many contacts can a contact tracer reasonably keep up with? <EOS>
You may qualify if  you have work authorization and meet the other eligibility requirements. 
Those seeking  unemployment insurance must generally meet the following requirements:
				
 have  lost employment through no fault of your own;
have enough prior earnings  from employment to establish a claim;
be ready, willing and able to work  immediately;
 and be actively seeking work.

				For more information about  unemployment insurance eligibility, application process, and payment options,  visit the New York  State Department of Labor Unemployment Insurance Assistance webpage and the ACCESS NYC  Unemployment Insurance webpage.
If you believe you  are eligible, apply online at labor.ny.gov/signin.  You may also call the New York State Department of Labor Unemployment Insurance  Telephone Claim Center at 888-209-8124 if you do not have access to a  computer.
Make sure you have the  following information with you:
				
Your Social  Security number
Your driver license  or Motor Vehicle ID card number (if you have either one)
Your complete  mailing address and zip code
A phone number  where we can reach you from 8 am - 5 pm, Monday –Friday
Your Alien  Registration card number (if you are not a U.S. Citizen and have a card)
Names and addresses  of all your employers for the last 18 months, including those in other states
Employer  Registration number or Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN) of your  most recent employer (FEIN is on your W-2 forms)
Your copies of  forms SF8 and SF50, if you were a federal employee
Your most recent  separation form (DD 214), for military service

				You can file a claim without all of these  documents. However, missing information can delay your first payment. <SEP> I am not a citizen.  Do I qualify for unemployment insurance? <EOS>

Staff and people incarcerated in correctional and detention facilities are at greater risk for some illnesses, such as COVID-19, because of the close living arrangements inside the facility. The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person, through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. This is why washing your hands regularly and avoid close contact with other people when possible prevents illness. <SEP> Do I have a greater chance of getting COVID-19? <EOS>
Any child over the age of 2 years old is encouraged to wear a face covering to the extent possible, but it's only required for children over the age of 10.  Adults accompanying minors should use the adult’s best judgment with respect to placing face coverings on a minor between the ages of two through nine. <SEP> Are children under the age of 10 encouraged to wear face coverings/masks? <EOS>
Wear a cloth face covering whenever you are out in the community, such as when getting groceries, medication or medical care. These face coverings help when you can’t avoid being in the same space as others. 
Wearing a cloth face covering does not mean you don’t need to stay away from others. Social distancing, or staying at least 6 feet from others, is still necessary to keep you and others safe. <SEP> When should I wear a cloth face covering? <EOS>
Great question! We’re glad you asked.
There’s a full section on helping others further down this list, with specific suggestions for donating blood, helping neighbors and reallocating resources. 
But the most helpful thing that you, an individual, can do is wear a mask and maintain six feet of physical distance from other people. We know it’s a pain, and we know a mask can be sweaty and uncomfortable. 
Frankly, though, it’s the simplest thing you can do to help. And no one is really exempt. Researchers believe that symptomless transmission is a factor in the spread of the virus. You might feel fine, but you could be infecting people around you. 
Not yet convinced? We’ll keep going. A mask is proven to be effective in slowing the virus’s spread. That also makes it a way to kickstart the sagging economy again; a Goldman Sachs analysis found that if all Americans were required to wear masks in public — as people are in dozens of other countries — it could save the U.S. economy $1 trillion. That’s trillion, with a T. 
A minor discomfort and inconvenience could save someone’s life. In fact, it could save quite a few lives. 
Our colleagues Jesse Wegman and Nicholas Kristof in the Opinion section offered their arguments for mask wearing. <SEP> How can I help? <EOS>
If NHS Test and Trace contacts you while you are on holiday to tell you that you have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus, you should tell your accommodation provider immediately and make arrangements to return home as quickly and directly as you can.
You should self-isolate for 14 days from the last day you had contact with the person who tested positive, even if you remain well. If you cannot avoid using public transport to get home, you should continue to self-isolate where you are staying and call 111 for advice.
If it is agreed with the accommodation provider that you can extend your stay in order to self-isolate until you are able to make safe travel arrangements, unless otherwise provided for in the contractual terms of the booking, you will be expected to pay the costs of an extended stay in all but exceptional circumstances.
In many cases it will not be possible to self-isolate at your holiday accommodation. In these cases, you should make arrangements to travel home as safely as possible, while minimising the risk to others. If this isn’t possible because you feel so unwell that you cannot travel, or if you cannot avoid using public transport, you should call 111 for advice.
If you start to feel unwell during your self-isolation period, get a test either online at www.nhs.uk/coronavirus or by calling 119.
People you have been travelling with, or people you live with, do not need to self-isolate if you do not have symptoms, unless contacted and asked to self-isolate by NHS Test and Trace. <SEP> 3.6 What happens if I am on holiday in England and I am contacted by NHS Test and Trace? <EOS>
On April 28th, the FDA issued emergency use authorization for antibody tests. There are over 120 antibody tests available, but only 12 had been authorized by the FDA as of May 15. It is not yet clear that the presence of antibodies suggests immunity to the virus. (Dr. Josh Sharfstein, 5/19/20)
Antibody tests aim to measure the body’s response to a coronavirus infection. These turn positive about five days after the onset of symptoms and can stay positive for weeks or months. There are many antibody tests on the market, but some of these are of low quality. Over the next few weeks, we hope to see a sorting out of which antibody tests are the most accurate.
Some people are saying that having antibodies is the same as being immune to coronavirus infection. Whether this is actually true, however, is not yet known. There is ongoing research to determine the extent to which antibody levels means that someone is not likely to become sick with coronavirus again. As a result, it is too soon to consider using antibody tests for “immune certificates” or other ideas that have been proposed. (Dr. Josh Sharfstein, 4/21/20) <SEP> How accurate are antibody tests? <EOS>
 APHIS’ mission is protecting the health and value of America’s agriculture and natural resources, and it’s vital that we continue to respond to agricultural emergencies in coordination with state and industry partners. <SEP>  What if a new pest or disease threat is detected? <EOS>
It is important to reduce your risk when using disinfectants:The disinfectant and its concentration should be carefully selected to avoid damaging surfaces and to avoid or minimize toxic effects on household members (or users of public spaces).Avoid combining disinfectants, such as bleach and ammonia, since mixtures can cause respiratory irritation and release potentially fatal gases.Keep children, pets and other people away during the application of the product until it is dry and there is no odour. Open windows and use fans to ventilate. Step away from odours if they become too strong. Disinfectant solutions should always be prepared in well-ventilated areas.Wash your hands after using any disinfectant, including surface wipes. Keep lids tightly closed when not in use. Spills and accidents are more likely to happen when containers are open. Do not allow children to use disinfectant wipes. Keep cleaning fluids and disinfectants out of the reach of children and pets. Throw away disposable items like gloves and masks if they are used during cleaning. Do not clean and re-use.Do not use disinfectant wipes to clean hands or as baby wipes.The minimum recommended personal protective equipment when disinfecting in non-health care settings is rubber gloves, waterproof aprons and closed shoes. Eye protection and medical masks may also be needed to protect against chemicals in use or if there is a risk of splashing.Note: Where cleaning and disinfection are not possible on a regular basis due to resource limitations, frequent hand washing and avoiding touching the face should be the primary prevention approaches to reduce any potential transmission associated with surface contamination. <SEP> What protection measures should people take when using disinfectants? <EOS>
No. The Order issued July 2 allows travel within the County, and in and out of the County, for any purpose. But it’s
    still safest to stay at home, so you should continue to avoid unnecessary trips. <SEP> Is travel still limited to essential purposes, like going to work at an essential business or going to my
        doctor’s office? <EOS>
If you think someone who is incarcerated in the facility is sick with COVID-19 (see COVID-19 symptoms), activate your emergency plan and notify local public health officials. Ensure that the sick person is wearing a clean, disposable facemaskpdf icon, and separate the sick person from others, ideally within an individual housing space and bathroom. Provide them with tissues for when they cough or sneeze, and a lined trash receptacle when possible.
Staff evaluating and providing care for confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases should follow the CDC Interim Clinical Guidance for Management of Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) and monitor the guidance website regularly for updates to these recommendations. Facilities without on-site healthcare staff should contact their state, local, tribal, and/or territorial health department to coordinate effective isolation and necessary medical care. Ensure only trained personnel wearing recommended personal protective equipment (PPE) have contact with or transport individuals who have or may have COVID-19.
People who are incarcerated and have COVID-19 should be placed under medical isolation in a separate room, ideally with solid walls and a solid door that closes fully. If not available, refer to the full guidance document for other options for medical isolation. If multiple people become ill with COVID-19:

Make every effort to house each ill person individually, with their own bathroom. Refer to the full guidance document for additional options if individual spaces are not available.
Prioritize those at high risk for complications of COVID-19 (older adults, people with severe underlying chronic medical conditions) for individual spaces that are available.

To prevent further spread:

Use options for virtual court appearances, if possible.
Suspend group gatherings.
Limit non-medical transfers of people within and between facilities. Ensure that anyone transferred out is screened for symptoms and contact with a COVID-19 case before leaving the facility.
Ensure that release planning includes screening for COVID-19 symptoms and contact with a case. Coordinate with local public health officials if releasing a symptomatic person to the community.
Use multiple social distancing strategies.
Handle laundry and food items of possible or confirmed cases of COVID-19 with recommended PPE.
Suspend visitation or offer non-contact visitation only.
Consider quarantining all new entrants for 14 days before they enter the facility. (Make sure that new entrants under quarantine are housed separately from other incarcerated people already under quarantine due to contact with a COVID-19 case.)
If releasing someone to a community facility (e.g., a homeless shelter), contact the facility’s staff to ensure adequate time for them to prepare to continue medical isolation, and coordinate with local public health officials.

Provide clear information to staff and people who are incarcerated about the presence of COVID-19 cases within the facility. Close contacts of the sick person (who have been within 6 feet of the sick person or had direct contact with infectious droplets, such as from a cough or sneeze) should be placed under quarantine for at least 14 days. Follow CDC guidance on quarantining close contacts of people with COVID-19.
If separate spaces for individual quarantined people are not available, refer to the full guidance document for other options. Monitor symptoms twice per day and move anyone developing symptoms to medical isolation right away (after ensuring they are wearing a face mask). Quarantined people at high risk for complications of COVID-19 (older adults, people with severe underlying chronic medical conditions) should not be housed with other quarantined people if at all possible. <SEP> What should I do if a person who is incarcerated in my facility may have COVID-19? <EOS>
The re-designed and soon to be launched Flexible Work Program is a management tool which assists employees and managers to understand their accountabilities and all available options as well as the impacts and considerations in the current environment and into the future.  Managers must consider feasibility of remote and flexible work and the program supports with guidance and tools for working in a varied, remote and/or on-site mixed workforce situations. <SEP> Will DND revisit pre-Covid-19 working from home policies? Policies that minimized working remotely and managers that are abusing policies of working remotely. If your team can work entirely electronically, why should the entire team be only allowed one work from home day a week all on the same day? <EOS>
No. Current WHO guidance for HCW caring for suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease patients recommends the use of contact and droplet precautions, in addition to standard precautions which should always be used by all HCW for all patients.
    In terms of PPE, contact and droplet precautions include wearing disposable gloves to protect hands, and clean, non-sterile, long-sleeve gown to protect clothes from contamination, medical masks to protect nose and mouth, and eye protection (e.g.,
    goggles, face shield), before entering the room where suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease patients are admitted. Respirators (e.g. N95) are only required for aerosol generating procedures.Click here for more information on PPE for HCW caring for suspected or confirmed nCoV patients. <SEP> Are boots, impermeable aprons, or coverall suits required as routine personal protective equipment (PE) for healthcare workers (HCW) caring for patients with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV infection? <EOS>
We understand that everyone is anxious to know how long it will take to resume business as usual. We cannot give a firm timeline because the return to work process will not be uniform across all divisions of the Defence Team. Many factors need to be considered, including but not limited to the public health conditions in your local region. Each department will have a unique Business Resumption Plan in place taking all of these factors into consideration and in line with Public Health guidance.
Please consult with your local chain of command or your manager to better understand your team's specific plan. <SEP> Will we get clear direction on how long we will be working remotely? How soon can I go back to work? <EOS>
To maintain patient and personnel safety during the COVID-19 national health emergency due to the pandemic, DHA is taking actions and making changes to military pharmacy operations. Several military pharmacies are practicing social distancing with drive-through or curbside pharmacy services. Call your local military pharmacy (the refill line) to check for changes and limitations to service. Visit www.tricare.mil/mtf to look up the phone number of your military pharmacy.

Retail network pharmacies are also taking measures for safe prescription pick up. They are practicing social distancing, adjusting hours, and/or many offer delivery options or curbside pickup. You can find more information about retail pharmacy operations during COVID-19 at: https://militaryrx.express-scripts.com/notices/other/get-your-medications-while-maintaining-distance-others.
TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery is an affordable option that limits your exposure compared to in-person pick up.

Any in-person mental health service exposes providers and patients to infection risk at present. The CARES Act describes federal initiatives to expand mental healthcare. The American Psychological Association and American Psychiatric Association have also put forth policy prescriptions to expand/enhance mental health care via technology including tele-mental health, telephonic mental health, and the use of apps and phone lines. (Dr. Kim Leary, 4/12/20) <SEP> How can cities support access to mental health services for vulnerable populations during the crisis? <EOS>
 If you are developing a molecular SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test, we recommend using the Molecular Diagnostics Template for Commercial Manufacturers to help facilitate the preparation, submission, and authorization of an EUA. We encourage you to reach out to us at CDRH-EUA-Templates@fda.hhs.gov if you wish to discuss an alternate approach.
If you are developing an antigen SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test, we recommend using the Antigen Template for Manufacturers to help facilitate the preparation, submission, and authorization of an EUA. We encourage you to reach out to us at CDRH-EUA-Templates@fda.hhs.gov if you wish to discuss an alternate approach. <SEP>  I am developing a molecular SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test kit for distribution to clinical laboratories and preparing to submit an EUA request. What template should I use? (Updated 5/4)? <EOS>
The commercial manufacturers in the list below provided notification to the FDA that they validated and intended to distribute a serology test as set forth in Section IV.D of the Policy for Coronavirus Disease-2019 Tests. The FDA had previously included them on the website notification list of commercial manufacturers distributing serology test kits under that policy, but they have now been removed from that notification list and placed on the list below. As noted in the guidance, if an EUA request is not submitted by a commercial manufacturer of a serology test within a reasonable period of time, or if significant problems are identified with such a test that cannot be or have not been addressed in a timely manner, the FDA intends to remove the manufacturer and test from the notification list. Commercial manufacturers may also voluntarily withdraw their test notification, and such tests are noted with an asterisk.
The FDA expects that the tests on this list will not be distributed unless and until an EUA is issued for the test, and the FDA may take additional actions as appropriate.
Recommendations for clinical laboratories and health care providers regarding these tests may be found in the FDA's June 19, 2020, Letter to Clinical Laboratory Staff and Health Care Providers.

Currently, there is insufficient data to assess the effectiveness of LPV/r or other antivirals for treating COVID-19. Several countries are evaluating the use of LPV/r and other antivirals and we welcome the results of these investigations.Again, as part of WHO’s response to the outbreak, the WHO R&D Blueprint has been activated to accelerate evaluation of diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics for this novel coronavirus. WHO has also designed a set of procedures to assess the performance, quality and safety of medical technologies during emergency situations. <SEP> What is WHO’s position on the use of antiretrovirals for the treatment of COVID-19? <EOS>
 Yes, provider site visits are waived at this time. <SEP>  Will AHCCCS waive requirements for site visits to enroll a provider? <EOS>
Researchers have found that the COVID-19 virus can be viable on plastic for up to 3 days, and on cardboard for up to 24 hours. So it would not be surprising to find COVID-19 virus on, for example, a piece of fruit in a bin at a grocery store that gets lots of customers. However, by following good food handling and preparation practices, you can minimize your risk of contracting COVID-19.
It is important to follow traditional food preparation guidelines such as washing produce and other foods well with water, cooking food thoroughly, and washing your hands with soap and water before and after food preparation, and before eating.
Drafted 18 March 2020 <SEP> Could the coronavirus be on fruits, vegetables, produce, or other food products? <EOS>
Generally, yes. Under Executive Order 2020-24(2), you are considered unemployed and can collect benefits if you are on a new leave of absence because of being sick with or exposed to COVID-19, because you're in isolation or self-quarantine due to elevated risk or exposure to COVID-19, because you are caring with someone diagnosed to COVID-19, or because one of the recent government directives related to COVID-19 has created a new family care responsibility (e.g., you’re on a leave of absence to care for children who are off school). Note that under the executive order, you are not eligible for unemployment benefits if you were on a sick leave or receiving disability benefits before the order went into effect. <SEP> Can I collect unemployment benefits if I am on a leave of absence? <EOS>
Touching your face can introduce dirt, oils, germs, and viruses onto your skin and into your body through your nose, mouth, and eyes. In addition to possibly making you sick, it can also worsen issues like acne and inflammation. <SEP> Why is touching your face bad for you? <EOS>
Even children who do not show symptoms may still carry the disease and pass it on to others. COVID-19 can easily be transmitted from person to person, and people do not have pre-existing immunity. Without controls, a large proportion of the population could become infected in any area where the virus circulates. In areas where large outbreaks occur, the health system may become overwhelmed, leading to an increasing fatality rate for COVID-19 as well as an increase in deaths from all causes. The severity of the situation thus requires communities to do what they can to limit transmission, including closing schools if necessary.

It is not at all clear whether Hydroxychloroquine is beneficial in preventing or treating COVID-19. It is currently under investigation in a variety of clinical trials - both to prevent COVID-19 and for treatment of COVID-19. Penn Medicine is participating in several clinical trials of medications to fight COVID-19, including hydroxychloroquine. There are risks with taking this medication long-term, and it is not currently recommended for patients to take outside of a clinical trial and not it if they do not have an established COVID-19 infection. <SEP> Does hydroxychloroquine treat coronavirus? <EOS>
There is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for COVID-19 infection. People infected with COVID-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms.

The goal of the Executive Order is to advise Minnesotans that wearing a face covering will protect them, their families, their friends, and others, and the expectation is that Minnesotans will voluntarily comply with the Order's requirements. Enforcement is not the goal of this Executive Order, but because these requirements are so important for the safety of our communities, Minnesotans who fail to comply with the Executive Order may receive a petty misdemeanor citation and a fine of up to $100. 
Businesses have heightened responsibility for public safety, given the volume of people that pass through Minnesota businesses on any given day. As such, businesses (and their owners and management) may be subject to criminal charges (up to a misdemeanor, $1,000 fine, and not more than 90 days in jail), civil enforcement and fines (of up to $25,000), and regulatory enforcement (e.g., actions by government authorities that license or regulate the business). <SEP> What's the penalty for not wearing a face covering? <EOS>
It’s true that we are sending inconsistent messages: “Take this seriously but be calm. Stay apart but come together.” It's hard to balance, but the basic truisms of communication do apply: be clear, concise, credible and consistent.
It cannot all fall to you. Bring people to the table and make sure they have your back. Try to communicate to different populations using the people in city government who are part of that group. If you have a 23-year-old hipster who knows some social media platform that you and I have never heard of, have him use it. Or record your mother or your father talking about you in a funny way and send it out as a robocall. Use whatever messengers you can find in creative ways to echo the message you're trying to get across.
You can only be yourself. But there is good data out there that shows social distancing is working. Constantly repeat that. Consider using more active language. I now call it mobilizing at home, and it empowers people to realize they're part of this solution—part of the team rather than isolated. (Juliette Kayyem, 4/6/20)
City Councilors and other city officials can use their networks to make doctors and other experts available for call-in sessions. These can, reach a lot of people with helpful messages and answer questions. (Dr. Josh Sharfstein, 4/6/20)
Be cautious about dividing reassuring and cautionary messaging between different spokespeople. If you do that, then it looks like there's a conflict between the messengers and the message gets muddy. Try instead to put those two messages together and explain that the reason there is (some, modest) good news to report is that people are complying. Otherwise people pick the message or the messenger they like best, and that's not going to generate a good outcome. (Dutch Leonard, 4/6/20) <SEP> How do we balance the more positive, uplifting messages with more serious messaging around preparation and urgency? <EOS>

 Yes, providers whose licensure enables them to practice independently in Arizona, who are not licensed physicians, are able to order home health services, provided they are able to assess and certify the medical necessity of such services within their scope of practice. For example, a Nurse Practitioner practicing independently in the state of Arizona may order home health services for a member within their care. The ordering provider must provide any necessary attestations, and adhere to any Prior Authorization requirements that are relevant for initiating and continuing home health care services to a member. <SEP>  Can a provider other than a physician order home health services for members during the COVID emergency? <EOS>

There are no approved at home treatments for COVID-19 at this time. For symptom management, we recommend acetaminophen (Tylenol) to control fever or pain. If Tylenol doesn’t help your symptoms, NSAIDs such as ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) or naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn) can be used, but only at recommended doses. <SEP> Should I take Tylenol (acetaminophen), Motrin (ibuprofen), or something else for my symptoms? <EOS>
An asymptomatic carrier is a person who comes down with COVID-19 without showing any symptoms.  These types of cases aren’t unique to just COVID-19. In fact, most infectious illnesses will have asymptomatic carriers, whether it’s the flu or a more outdated illness, like typhoid fever. <SEP> What is an asymptomatic case of COVID-19? <EOS>
Outdoors stands will largely be safer than indoor spaces. What you want to be thinking about is high-touch surfaces, at the counter or maybe the sales area. If that could be disinfected, that would be helpful. Outdoor businesses should also follow social distancing guidelines, such as marking a six-foot distance between patrons in line. (Dr. Caitlin Rivers, 5/26/20) <SEP> As we head into the summer months, what can you tell us about improving the safety of operations for businesses that operate outdoors, such as fireworks vendors or food and ice cream trucks? <EOS>
You will be treated just as you would if you did not show up for work any other time.

Children should clean their hands often using soap and water or 60% alcohol-based hand sanitizer.  They should use tissues if they cough or sneeze, throw the tissues away, and then wash their hands.  Children should stay away from people who are sick.  They should stay up to date on vaccinations, including the flu shot. <SEP> How can the infection be prevented in children? <EOS>
Yes. Healthcare facilities, educational and childcare facilities, and other facilities that are specifically
    identified in a Health Officer Directive are exempt from the capacity limitations. But these facilities must still
    limit capacity to ensure that people can easily maintain at least 6-foot social distancing from one another, except
    as may be necessary. Also, minors under the age of 12, when accompanied by an adult, do not count toward the density
    limitations.
Finally, food facilities must limit the number of workers inside the facility at any time to 1 worker per 250 gross
    square feet, unless the facility has 1,000 gross square feet or less. If a food facility has 1,000
    gross square feet or less, the facility may have up to 4 workers inside the facility at any time. For example, a 700
    square foot food facility may have up to 4 workers inside at a time. If 300 square feet of space is accessible to
    the public, 2 customers may also be inside the facility at a time. <SEP> Are there any exceptions to the restrictions on capacity in business facilities? <EOS>
Doctors strongly recommend performing CPR when someone needs it.
You could be hundreds of times more likely to save that dying person’s life than you are to die from Covid-19 if you contract it after performing CPR, according to a report published by a group of Seattle emergency room physicians in the journal Circulation.
But it’s important to act quickly for CPR to be effective. 
“The chance of survival goes down by 10% for every minute without CPR,” said Dr. Comilla Sasson, vice president for science and innovation in emergency cardiovascular care at the American Heart Association. “It’s a 10-minute window to death in many cases.”
If you’re not certified in CPR, performing chest compressions could also buy more time until help arrives. Bystanders should “provide high-quality chest compressions by pushing hard and fast in the middle of the victim’s chest, with minimal interruptions,” the American Heart Association said. 
If you’re not sure how “fast” to do to those chest compressions, singing any of these popular songs will help you get the right rhythm. <SEP> Is it safe to perform CPR on a stranger? <EOS>
 In accordance with CMS guidance, AHCCCS is requesting that Health Plans and FFS Programs maintain investigative efforts for serious health and safety threats (e.g. allegations of abuse). Health Plans and FFS Programs should do their part to support sound infection control protocols, including limiting the number of staff that go onsite for the investigation, implementation of preventive practices such as handwashing and use of hand sanitizer before engaging with members and staff, and assessment of staff health before entering the facility.   If Health  Plans and FFS Programs encounter issues with ability to conduct onsite/in-person investigation of immediate quality of care concerns, please notify AHCCCS QM of the limitation at CQM@azahcccs.gov. <SEP>  Should Health Plans continue to go onsite to provider locations to investigate immediate quality of care concerns? <EOS>
You have to look at several different numbers together: how many tests are being done, how many are positive, and is that ratio changing? If a particular city has good access to testing, the number of tests is the same, and the number of positives is rising, then it may well be that the true number of cases is going up. On the other hand, if your testing capacity has changed by a factor of 10, and positive cases have too, the actual number of cases may not be fundamentally much different, so it’s important to look at multiple data points.
Hospitalizations help you understand impact, but hospitalizations come later in the cycle of the disease. If you're waiting for data from hospitalizations alone, it may be too late to avoid a significant surge in cases. (Dr. Josh Sharfstein, 4/29/20) <SEP> Are hospitalizations a better measure of the spread of the virus than confirmed cases, given the lack of tests? <EOS>
 Most people will have mild effects from the virus, but it can cause severe illness and pneumonia in others. Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. People with these symptoms may have COVID-19: 
Fever or chills
Cough
Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
Fatigue
Muscle or body aches
Headache
New loss of taste or smell
Sore throat
Congestion or runny nose
Nausea or vomiting
Diarrhea
 This list does not include all possible symptoms. For the most up to date list of symptoms, please visit CDC Symptoms of Coronavirus. <SEP>  What are the symptoms? <EOS>
 Testing strategy and protocol for critical infrastructure, including meat, poultry, and processed egg product facilities, should be developed by each State, based on ongoing guidance from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and CDC. <SEP>  Is there a national testing plan specific to meat and poultry processing plants? <EOS>
If you have a doctor or healthcare provider, call them to be evaluated for a test.
If you don't have a healthcare provider, free or low-cost testing is available at several King County locations, regardless of immigration status. Multiple languages are spoken and phone interpretation is available at each site. You can also call the King County COVID-19 Call Center at 206-477-3977 from 8 AM – 7 PM for assistance. If you need an interpreter, say the name of your language. <SEP> 13. Where can I get tested? <EOS>
Herd immunity occurs when a large enough proportion of the population is immune to the virus to prevent it from finding enough suitable hosts to spread quickly. The primary way we achieve herd immunity to communicable diseases is through vaccination. In the absence of an effective vaccine, the only way to achieve herd immunity for a highly contagious disease is for a large majority of the population to become infected. Exposing the general population to the virus in a deliberate effort to achieve herd immunity would lead to a spike of new cases that could quickly overwhelm local health care systems, leading to widespread suffering and death.
If there are stakeholders in your area using the idea of herd immunity to argue for lifting restrictions, look to local public health officials, healthcare executives, or other credible experts who can help explain the implications of doing so. (Dr. Tom Frieden, 4/21/20) <SEP> How should we respond to those arguing for lifting restrictions in order to achieve “herd immunity”? <EOS>
 Since the science behind COVID-19 is still emerging, persons who have recovered from COVID-19 should still wear masks, practice respiratory hygiene, including good hand washing, and social distance. Currently, any immunity from COVID-19 disease appears to be limited, and it may be possible for persons to become reinfected within a few to several months after their initial illness. <SEP>  If I've already had COVID-19 do I still need to wear a mask? <EOS>
Teledentistry is the use of telehealth systems in dentistry.  It isn’t the same as face-to-face exams or treatment.  It:
    
Limits exposure to COVID-19 through social distancing
Delivers virtual health and education.  
Lets dentists and dental specialists advise patients.  They can consult with other dental providers. They can assess and direct a patient to the right source of care (if needed).  
Serves patients with certain dental conditions and concerns. 
Can decrease the number of patients seeking dental care at emergency departments (ED).


Providers offer advice and education through: 
    
Live video interaction
Store-and-forward.  This is when a patient, provider, or location sends records or data to a different dental provider or specialist.  This happens using secure system.  


There may not be a way to conduct a teledentistry appointment.  The patient may not have internet access. The patient’s locate is too remote – there’s not enough bandwidth.  A provider may call to provide advice, consultation, and/or triage. <SEP> What is teledentistry? <EOS>
To protect yourself and your family:

Avoid large crowds and busy places as much as possible.
Stay at least 6 feet from people you don't live with. COVID-19 can spread before
               a person has symptoms and even when someone has no symptoms.
Adults and kids over 2 years old should wear a mask or cloth face covering when
               going out.
Wash your hands well and often. Wash
               for at least 20 seconds with soap and water or use hand sanitizer with at least 60%
               alcohol. Teach your kids to do the same.
Try not to touch your eyes, nose, or mouth.
Use a household cleaner or wipe to clean and disinfect surfaces and objects that
               people touch a lot.
Keep informed about the spread of coronavirus in your community. You can find
               this on your local health department's website. Follow their recommendations, especially
               if many people in your area have coronavirus.
Make sure your children get all their vaccinations.
               Protect them against illnesses like measles
               and the flu. Kids who have another infection may
               have a harder time getting better if they do get COVID-19. <SEP> How Can We Protect Ourselves From Coronavirus (COVID-19)? <EOS>
Cloth face coverings should NOT be considered PPE and should NOT be worn by healthcare personnel (HCP) in place of a respirator or facemask if more than source control is required.  Facemasks are preferred for HCP to wear while in a healthcare facility as they offer both source control and protection against exposure to splashes and sprays of infectious materials from others.  **This recommendation does not change CDC’s guidance to use N95 or equivalent respirators when providing care for patients with suspected or known COVID-19. <SEP> Are cloth masks considered PPE for healthcare personnel? <EOS>
Children with underlying health conditions such as cystic fibrosis or cancer should wear a medical mask in consultation with their medical providers. A medical mask provides protection to the person wearing the mask and prevents transmission to others. It is recommended for anyone who has underlying health conditions that put them at greater risk of serious illness. <SEP> Should children who have health issues or a medical condition that compromises their immune system wear a mask? <EOS>
We're making every effort to protect you, other Veterans, and our staff from exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19. This includes:
Providing telehealth care by phone and video when possible and recommended by your provider
Following all CDC recommendations for cleaning our facilities
Screening all Veterans, caregivers, and staff for COVID-19 symptoms each time they enter a VA health facility
Requiring everyone who enters our facilities to wear a cloth face covering. Like physical distancing, face coverings help prevent spreading the virus when people cough, sneeze, or talk. Read our question about face coverings for more information. For more information on how to wear, sanitize, and make a cloth face covering, go to the CDC website.
Requiring our health care providers to use appropriate protective attire when providing care. This may include a face mask, eye protection, gloves, or a gown, depending on the provider's level of contact and length of time spent with you.
If you have questions about any of our safety measures, please talk to your provider. To learn more about how to protect yourself and others, go to the CDC website. <SEP> How else will VA protect me from exposure to COVID-19? <EOS>
While pneumonia-like lung disease is the most common complication with COVID-19, doctors are also seeing evidence of other complications, including injury to the kidneys. 
Some hospitals have reported being short on dialysis machines and dialysis filters to treat the patients who have these systems. As a means of preparation, mayors may consider asking their hospitals about potential needs for additional dialysis machines and filters. (Dr. Josh Sharfstein, 5/9/20) <SEP> Should cities be prepared for increased need of dialysis machines? <EOS>
In 2019, WHO issued a new guideline that brought together 32 existing or new recommendations on a range of sexual and reproductive health self-care interventions. The guideline has recommendations on pregnancy and newborn care, contraception, abortion, sexually transmitted infections including HIV and HPV, and for sexual health more broadly. The full list of recommendations can be found here: <SEP> What self care actions can I take to protect my sexual and reproductive health? <EOS>
The mortality rate is the percentage of people who died due to COVID-19 out of the total number of people with COVID-19 reported. Since this is an ongoing outbreak, the percentage can change daily. There are several reasons for this, such as there may be delays in reporting of additional confirmed cases of COVID-19 and not all COVID-19 cases will be detected. <SEP> What does the mortality rate mean? Why does this percentage keep changing? <EOS>
If you do develop symptoms, like a fever, cough, or shortness of breath, that is when you would need to self-isolate at home, away from other household members. If you develop these symptoms, contact your medical provider but stay home as long as those symptoms are manageable (like you would for a normal cold or flu). If you have severe shortness of breath or if symptoms suddenly get worse, that is when you should seek out medical care. <SEP> What are the signs or symptoms that someone should self-isolate? When can the self-isolation end? <EOS>
Yes.

Quarantine is for people who are not currently showing symptoms but are at increased risk for having been exposed to an infectious disease. Quarantine is for people who could become sick and spread the infection to others.


Isolation is used for people who are currently ill and able to spread the disease and who need to stay away from others in order to avoid infecting them. <SEP> 17. Is quarantine different from isolation? <EOS>
Many ethical frameworks have been produced for resource allocation, some of which have
been included in pandemic plans. Those frameworks provide useful guidance in the current
scenario. Yet, when applying them, we must take into account the type of health care
resource, the context, and the stage of the pandemic. That is, while the ethical principles that
apply to resource allocation might be the same in different pandemics, they can lead to
different decisions, given contextual circumstances. For example, this pandemic appears to
significantly impact older adults (those 60 years of age or older), and such characteristics are
relevant to shaping priorities for the allocation of resources during COVID-19. As a result, it
may be inappropriate to use critical care triage guidelines that have age cut-offs that
deprioritize or exclude those aged over 60 years.When applying ethical guidelines for resource allocation, we should consider the extent to
which resources are overwhelmed in the current context. It would be inappropriate, for
instance, to exclude population groups from being allocated a resource (for example,
ventilators) at the outset of a pandemic when capacity remains. When resources are scarce,
though – when there is an insufficient supply to meet everyone’s needs – resource allocation
should be guided by well established, broadly applicable ethical principles, unless there are
characteristics of the outbreak that justify different courses of action. Irrelevant
characteristics of populations within countries, such as ethnicity, race or creed, should play
no role in any resource allocation in any pandemic. This reflects our commitment to treating
people with equal respect. <SEP> Can I adapt previous frameworks for pandemic influenza to guide resource allocation for COVID-19? <EOS>
Currently, there is no evidence to suggest that food animals could be a possible route for transmission of COVID-19 to humans or that food animals can become infected by humans. Studies are underway to better understand the susceptibility of different animal species to the COVID-19 virus and to assess infection dynamics in susceptible animal species. Additional information can be found on the website of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). <SEP> Could the virus be transmitted from humans to food animals or vice versa? <EOS>

Golf courses may re-open, so long as they adopt minimum social distancing policies that include:

Implementing electronic or telephone reservation and payment systems while still providing options for populations that do not have access to internet service or credit cards;
Extending tee times to sixteen minutes apart;
Limiting the use of golf carts to one person unless being shared by immediate family members, caretakers, household members, or romantic partners;
Requiring frequent, and after each use, sanitization of high-touch areas such as restroom facilities, range buckets, golf carts, and push carts;
Restricting the touching of golf holes and flags;
Removing bunker rakes and other furniture-like benches, water coolers, and ball washers from the course;
Requiring players to always maintain appropriate social distancing by remaining six feet apart from others.

Four player tee-times, forecaddies, equipment rentals, and the reopening of restrooms are allowed, with disinfecting and hygiene protocols in place. Golf courses may impose additional restrictions as necessary to limit person-to-person interactions.
Players and employees should wear cloth face coverings while on the golf course.
Driving ranges may also reopen both indoor and outdoor areas so long as they follow the required social distancing and safety guidelines. Mandatory mitigation policies include:

Limiting total capacity of any outdoor area to a number that ensures that all individuals can remain six feet apart
Limiting the number of patrons in any indoor premises to 25 percent capacity – excluding employees
Requiring workers and customers to wear cloth face coverings while indoors, except where doing so would inhibit that individual's health or where the individual is under two years of age
If a customer refuses to wear a cloth face covering for non-medical reasons then the business must decline the individual entry into the indoor premises
Prohibiting the consumption of food or beverages and smoking in indoor areas. Exceptions are allowed for individuals engaging in conduct necessary for their health or safety, such as briefly removing their mask to drink water. In addition, employees may consume food and beverages in areas not open to the public, such as an employee break room.

For a full list of required safety protocols, refer to section 7 of page 13 of Executive Order No. 157 and Executive Order No. 158.

Individuals with a confirmed case of COVID-19 must maintain home isolation until at least 3 days have passed since recovery began — defined as the end of a fever without the use of fever-reducing medications and improvement in respiratory symptoms (e.g., the end of their cough and/or shortness of breath); and, at least 7 days have passed since symptoms first appeared.
After discontinuation of home isolation, persons must continue to avoid sustained close contact with others, maintain strict social distancing and hand hygiene, and not return to work for an additional 4 days (for a total of 7 days without symptoms) due to the possible risk of continued infectiousness. Persons may return to work after this 7-day period, however, they should continue to recognize the risk of infectiousness and self-monitor for symptoms. <SEP> How is ‘recovery’ defined in someone with COVID-19? <EOS>
The COVID-19 novel coronavirus is a new type of coronavirus that has not been previously identified. Like many emerging pathogens, it jumped from animals to human populations and has caused the current pandemic.

“This is an opportunity to help kids learn that when they feel worried about things, it’s important to talk to people,” says Dr. Rogers. “You can tell a child, ‘When you feel anxious, talk to grown-ups about it because they can often help you.’”
Dr. Rogers suggests approaching a child’s worries in a curious way. “You can say, ‘What if I told you most kids aren’t getting very sick from this?’ Then you can give them information.”
Also, adults need to understand that children may respond to stress is different ways. Kids may misbehave, become more clingy, seem more giddy or hyper, be more demanding, moody or irritable.
“Kids don’t always know that their behavior has changed or why,” says Dr. Rogers. “They need adults to help them understand and express their feelings in healthy ways.”
Adults should initiate conversation with their kids and encourage them to share their thoughts and feelings. Talk about all different types of feelings a child might be having. “Some kids might feel really worried about if they will get sick. Some kids might be happy to have a vacation from school or might miss their friends,” says Dr. Rogers. “Encourage the child to share if he or she has any of those feelings—or some different ones.”
It’s also important for adults to help children identify ways to cope with their emotions. Some ideas include:

Talking with a trusted adult
Taking deep breaths
Drawing pictures 
Writing a story about how they feel

“Children often use distraction as a coping strategy and this can be helpful, but adults should still help them take time to discuss their feelings about what is happening in their life,” adds Dr. Rogers.
Older children, youth and young adults may benefit from a reminder about how easy it is to get swept up in misinformation or panic through online media, and they may need help to figure out trustworthy sources of information and learn to manage their screen use. <SEP> Talk to kids to help alleviate anxiety with coronavirus <EOS>
Evaluate your workplace to identify situations where employees cannot maintain a distance of at least 6 feet from each other and/or customers. Use appropriate combinations of controls following the hierarchy of controls to addresses these situations to limit the spread of COVID-19. A committee of both employees and management may be the most effective way to recognize all of these scenarios.
It is important to note that control recommendations or interventions assigned to reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19 must be compatible with any safety programs and personal protective equipment (PPE) normally required for the job task.
Approaches to consider may include the following:
Alter the workspace using engineering controls to prevent exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19.

Make sure the workspace is well-ventilatedexternal icon.
Change the alignment of workstations where feasible. For example, redesign workstations so employees are not facing each other.
Consider making foot traffic one-way in narrow or confined areas, such as aisles and stairwells, to encourage single-file movement at a 6-foot distance.
Set up, where possible, physical barriers between employees, and between employees and customers.

Use strip curtains, plastic barriers, or similar materials to create impermeable dividers or partitions.


Move electronic payment terminals/credit card readers farther away from the cashier to increase the distance between the customer and the cashier.
Use visual cues such as floor decals, colored tape, and signs to remind employees to maintain distance of 6 feet from others, including at their workstation and in break areas.

Consider these cues for customers as well, such as at the entrance or checkout line.


Place handwashing stations or hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol throughout the workplace for employees and customers.

Use touch-free stations where possible.
Make sure restrooms are well-stocked with soap and paper towels.



Provide training and other administrative policies to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

All employees should have a basic understanding of COVID-19, how the disease spreads, symptoms, and ways to prevent or minimize the spread.
Trainings should cover the importance of social distancing (maintaining a distance of at least 6 feet), wearing cloth face coverings appropriately, covering coughs and sneezes, washing hands, cleaning and disinfecting high-touch surfaces, not sharing personal items or tools/equipment unless absolutely necessary, and not touching the face, mouth, or eyes.
Employees should be encouraged to go home or stay home if they feel sick. Ensure that sick leave policies are flexible and consistent with local public healthexternal icon guidance, and that employees are aware of and understand these policies.

Use cloth face coverings as appropriate.

Recommend employees wear a cloth face covering.

Cloth face coverings are intended to protect other people—not the wearer. They are not considered PPE.
Train employees how to put on and take off cloth face coverings to avoid contamination.
Cloth face coverings should be washed and dried after each use.
Cloth face coverings should not be worn if their use creates a new risk (e.g., interferes with driving or vision, contributes to heat-related illness) that exceeds their benefit of slowing the spread of the virus.


Recommend that visitors to the workplace (service personnel, customers) also wear cloth face coverings.

Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
PPE is the last step in the hierarchy of controls because it is harder to use effectively than other measures. To be protective and not introduce an additional hazard, the use of PPE requires characterization of the environment, knowledge of the hazard, training, and consistent correct use. This is why administrative and engineering controls are emphasized in guidance to slow the spread of COVID-19. In the current pandemic, use of PPE such as surgical masks or N-95 respirators is being prioritized for healthcare employees and other medical first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance unless they were required for the job before the pandemic. <SEP> What can be done to protect employees who cannot maintain social distancing of at least 6 feet from other employees or customers? <EOS>
People are concerned that, in accelerating the vaccine development process to “warp speed,” we will be skipping critical safety steps. People at the FDA have a very deep understanding of what can go wrong with vaccines and the kind of testing that's needed to identify problems early in the development process.
Dr. Fauci has stated that there’s no plan to skip safety steps. We're just using money to push everything forward faster. We're not waiting for companies to decide that it's a good investment and inch forward, double-checking that it makes financial sense for them at every stage. Instead we're going to invest in every stage and in lots of possibilities. That’s an important message to get out.
We'll get new data at each step. The first step is that the vaccine made it through the initial safety studies: people can take it and it's not immediately dangerous. You still need to understand how it behaves in different populations, like the elderly and children. There are different safety studies that have to be done, and Dr. Fauci has confirmed that we're going to do them.
There will be a lot of news about the ups and downs of the vaccine development process. A vaccine has to pass all the tests to be ready for the public. Passing one step doesn't mean a vaccine is going to pass the next one, so prepare your community for the possibility that it could be longer than we hope before we have a safe and effective vaccine. (Dr. Josh Sharfstein, 5/29/20)
As Dr. Fauci said, the risk is being concentrated on the financial side, not on the health side. We are reducing the risk on the health side by pushing forward simultaneously on many different risky ventures. We're going to fund all of them, and some are going to work and some will fail. That's a tolerable risk because it's only a financial risk. (Dutch Leonard, 5/29/20) <SEP> How do we get promising vaccines scaled quickly and safely? <EOS>

Yes. You can fill out your census form online here.
The deadline to complete your census form is now September 30.
The Census is more than just a population count. It's the data that the federal government and the state government rely upon to make decisions that impact our communities.
New Jersey was undercounted in 2010, and because of that, we have left -- over the course of the past decade, and even today -- untold billions of dollars in federal aid on the table.
Results from the 2020 Census will also be used to determine the number of seats each state has in Congress and your political representation at all levels of government.
It's especially important for immigrant communities, who have historically been undercounted, to fill out their census forms. By law, your census responses cannot be used against you by any government agency or court in any way— not by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and not by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The law requires the Census Bureau to keep your information confidential and use your responses only to produce statistics.
Please take a moment, go online to my2020census.gov and make sure you are counted in the Census. It's quick and easy. The 2020 Census questionnaire will take about 10 minutes to complete. It's safe, secure, and confidential. Your information and privacy are protected.

You can encourage your child to help stop the spread of COVID-19 by teaching them to do the same things everyone should do to stay healthy.

Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
Stay home when you are sick, except to get medical care.
Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue and throw the tissue in the trash.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.
If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces and objects (e.g., tables, countertops, light switches, doorknobs, and cabinet handles).
Launder items, including washable plush toys, as appropriate and in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. If possible, launder items using the warmest appropriate water setting for the items and dry items completely. Dirty laundry from an ill person can be washed with other people’s items.

Since COVID-19 tests are new, knowing the accuracy is challenging. The accuracy and predictive values of SARS-CoV-2 testing have not been evaluated, and the accuracy of testing depends on which test is used, the type of specimen tested, how it was collected and the duration of illness.  No medical test is 100% accurate for many reasons, including error and timing of the test. Because it is possible to get a negative result even when you have coronavirus, it is important to be careful even when you receive a negative result. Some doctors recommend quarantining yourself until symptom-free for at least 72 hours. <SEP> How accurate is COVID testing? <EOS>

A 2010 study used two viruses that are related to the COVID-19 virus to look at the effects of temperature and humidity on viral survival. Researchers found that both lower temperatures and lower humidity helped viruses survive longer. In particular, at 4 degrees C, or 40 degrees F, and 20% relative humidity, more than two thirds of the viruses survived for 28 days. On the other end of the spectrum, at 40 degrees C, or 104 degrees F, and 80% humidity, the viruses survived for less than 6 hours.
This suggests that coronaviruses survive better on surfaces at colder temperatures. It is also expected that the virus would survive being frozen.

Yes — as long as you use the right kind of sanitizer and use it correctly.
Hand sanitizers “need to have at least 60% alcohol in them,” said Dr. William Schaffner, professor of preventative medicine and infectious disease at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. 
And don’t just put a little dollop in your hand and smear it around quickly. 
“You’ve got to use enough and get it all over the surfaces,” Schaffner said. “Rub it all over your hands, between your fingers and on the back of your hands.”
But it’s always better to thoroughly wash your hands, if you’re able to. 
“Alcohol is pretty effective at killing germs, but it doesn’t wash away stuff,” said Dr. John Williams, a virologist at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh.
“If somebody’s just sneezed into their hand, and their hand is covered with mucus, they would have to use a lot more alcohol to inactivate that bacteria or virus.” <SEP> Is hand sanitizer as effective as soap and water in killing coronavirus? <EOS>
Some industry-specific  professional organizations have recommended suspending certain types of testing  while there is ongoing community spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes  COVID-19.

Additionally, the Council for Accreditation in Occupational Hearing Conservation  recommended that audiometric evaluations be suspended indefinitely.
OSHA is providing temporary enforcement  discretion around the requirements of certain standards, including where OSHA standards require initial or recurring training, audits, reviews, testing, or assessments.  More information is available in the COVID-19 enforcement guidance, provided on  the Enforcement Memos page. Employers  should regularly check the Standards page of OSHA's  COVID-19 Safety and Health Topics page for updates on the status of these memoranda. <SEP> In light of some professional  organizations' recommendations to suspend certain types of testing required  under OSHA standards, what should employers do to remain in compliance? <EOS>
As of May 18, all construction projects may resume. Construction projects must follow appropriate mitigation requirements, as outlined below.
Construction projects must adopt policies that include, at minimum, the following requirements:

Prohibit non-essential visitors from entering the worksite;
Engage in appropriate social distancing measures when picking up or delivering equipment or materials;
Limit worksite meetings, inductions, and workgroups to groups of fewer than ten individuals;
Require individuals to maintain six feet or more distance between them wherever possible;
Stagger work start and stop times where practicable to limit the number of individuals entering and leaving the worksite concurrently;
Identify congested and "high-risk areas," including but not limited to lunchrooms, breakrooms, portable rest rooms, and elevators, and limit the number of individuals at those sites concurrently where practicable;
Stagger lunch breaks and work times where practicable to enable operations to safely continue while utilizing the least number of individuals possible at the site;
Require workers and visitors to wear cloth face coverings while on the premises, except where doing so would inhibit the individual's health or the individual is under two years of age. Businesses must provide, at their expense, such face coverings for their employees.
If a visitor refuses to wear a cloth face covering for non-medical reasons and if such covering cannot be provided to the individual by the business at the point of entry, then businesses must decline entry to the individual.
Where an individual declines to wear a face covering on the premises due to a medical condition that inhibits such usage, neither the business nor its staff shall require the individual to produce medical documentation verifying the stated condition.
Businesses may adopt policies that require staff to wear gloves, in addition to regular hand hygiene. Where a business requires its staff to wear gloves while at the worksite, the business must provide such gloves to staff.
Require infection control practices, such as regular hand washing, coughing and sneezing etiquette, and proper tissue usage and disposal;
Limit sharing of tools, equipment, and machinery;
Where running water is not available, provide portable washing stations with soap and/or alcohol-based hand sanitizers that have greater than 60% ethanol or 70% isopropanol;
Require frequent sanitization of high-touch areas like restrooms, breakrooms, equipment, and machinery;
When the worksite is an occupied residence, require workers to sanitize work areas and keep a distance of at least six feet from the occupants;
Place conspicuous signage at entrances and throughout the worksite detailing the above mandates;
Immediately separate and send home workers who appear to have symptoms consistent with COVID-19 illness upon arrival at work or who become sick during the day; and
Promptly notify workers of any known exposure to COVID-19 at the worksite, consistent with the confidentiality requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act and any other applicable laws;
Clean and disinfect the worksite in accordance with CDC guidelines when a worker at the site has been diagnosed with COVID-19 illness;
Continue to follow guidelines and directives issued by the New Jersey Department of Health, the CDC and the Occupational Health and Safety Administration, as applicable, for maintaining a clean, safe and healthy work environment.

During New Jersey's public health emergency, timeframes governing the Department of Environmental Protection's provision of public notice, review and decisions on permits and other approvals have been paused or delayed by Executive Order 136.
In addition, a new law extends certain government permits, approvals, and deadlines for certain construction and real estate projects during the COVID-19 emergency so these projects are not abandoned. For more details, refer to Assembly Bill 3919.

These tests tell you if you had a previous infection by looking for antibodies in the blood.  Antibodies are proteins made by the immune system when a germ enters a person’s body. Our immune system helps us fight off germs and diseases. The test uses a blood sample to look for antibodies made in response to SARS-CoV-2 rather than looking for the virus itself. It usually takes 1-3 weeks for the body to make antibodies in response to an infection. We do not know how much protection the antibodies might provide or how long this protection might last.
Antibody tests have limited ability to diagnose COVID-19 and should not be used alone to diagnose COVID-19. Results from these tests should also not be used to make decisions about staffing or the ability of an employee to return to work, the need for available personal protective equipment (PPE), or the need to discontinue preventive measures, like social distancing. <SEP> Should I be tested with an antibody (serology) test for COVID-19? <EOS>
The guidance for the clinically extremely vulnerable is that shielding has been paused from 1 August. This means:

you do not need to follow previous shielding advice
you can go to work as long as the workplace is COVID-Secure but should carry on working from home wherever possible
clinically extremely vulnerable children should attend education settings in line with the wider guidance on reopening of schools and guidance for full opening: special schools and other specialist settings

you can go outside as much as you like but you should still try to keep your overall social interactions low
you can visit businesses, such as supermarkets, pubs and shops, whilst keeping 2 metres away from others wherever possible or 1 metre plus other precautions
• you should continue to wash your hands carefully and more frequently than usual and that you maintain thorough cleaning of frequently touched areas in your home and/or workspace
• you will no longer receive free food parcels, medicine deliveries and basic care from the National Shielding Service

For practical tips on staying safe see the guidance on how to stay safe outside your home.
You will still be able to get:

local volunteer support by contacting your local authority
prescriptions, essential items and food you buy delivered by NHS Volunteer Responders

priority slots for supermarket deliveries (if you previously registered for free food parcels).

Information about COVID-19 in children is somewhat limited, but the information that is available suggests that children with confirmed COVID-19 generally had mild symptoms. Person-to-person spread from or to children, as among adults, is thought to occur mainly via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks.  Recent studies indicate that people who are infected but do not have symptoms likely also play a role in the spread of COVID-19.
However, a small percentage of children have been reported to have more severe illness. Despite lower risk of serious illness, children with COVID-19-like symptoms should avoid contact with older adults and people of any age who may be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. <SEP> Are children more at-risk? <EOS>
The rise in the number of COVID-19 cases reflects the rapid community spread of COVID-19 in many U.S. states, territories and communities. Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected. Also, the number of cases of COVID-19 being reported in the United States is rising due to increased laboratory testing and reporting across the country. <SEP> Why are we seeing a rise in cases? <EOS>

An antiviral drug must be able to target the specific part of a virus's life cycle that is necessary for it to reproduce. In addition, an antiviral drug must be able to kill a virus without killing the human cell it occupies. And viruses are highly adaptive. Because they reproduce so rapidly, they have plenty of opportunity to mutate (change their genetic information) with each new generation, potentially developing resistance to whatever drugs or vaccines we develop. <SEP> Why is it so difficult to develop treatments for viral illnesses? <EOS>
If you have any symptoms or have had contact with people who have COVID-19, you may be asked to get an exam and be tested for COVID-19. Even if you don’t test positive, you should be provided with an emergency phone number to call in case symptoms develop later.  You should not be charged by the country for:examinations to determine your health statusrequired vaccinations or protective equipment on arrival (if these were not published at least 10 days earlier)appropriate isolation or quarantine facilitiesrequired certificates at the point of entry that document measures applied any baggage accompanying you <SEP> What happens if I have symptoms when arriving at my destination? <EOS>
Events with 10 or more individuals should be cancelled or postponed.  Events serving high-risk populations should be postponed or conducted virtually. If none of these options are available, practice social distancing and limit the number of people in attendance as much as possible.  Staff meetings should be postponed or conducted virtually.  If in-person staff meetings must occur, social distancing strategies must be implemented to prevent the spread of illness.  
If the agency has legally required meetings or events, the agency should work with their General Counsel or the Attorney General’s Office to assess options for adjusting these requirements during the state of emergency to protect the health and safety of employees and the public. <SEP> Should I attend or host meetings and events for work?

 As stated in Section IV.D of the FDA's Policy for Coronavirus Disease-2019 Tests, the FDA does not intend to object to a commercial manufacturer's development and distribution of serology tests to identify antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 for a reasonable period of time, where the test has been validated and while the manufacturer is preparing its EUA request, where the manufacturer gives notification to the FDA and information along the lines of the following is included in the instructions for use:
This test has not been reviewed by the FDA.
Negative results do not preclude acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. If acute infection is suspected, direct testing for SARS-CoV-2 is necessary.
Results from antibody testing should not be used to diagnose or exclude acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Positive results may be due to past or present infection with non-SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus strains, such as coronavirus HKU1, NL63, OC43, or 229E.
As noted in the guidance, FDA believes that 10 business days is a reasonable period of time to prepare an EUA submission for such tests. Unless and until an EUA is issued that authorizes additional testing environments for a specific test, under CLIA, use of that test is limited to laboratories certified to perform high complexity testing, and at the point-of-care when covered by the laboratory's CLIA certificate for high-complexity testing.
This policy does not apply to at-home testing, including at-home specimen collection.
The commercial manufacturers that have notified FDA that they have validated and intend to distribute serology tests as set forth in Section IV.D of the FDA's Policy for Coronavirus Disease-2019 Tests are listed on this FAQ page under What commercial manufacturers are distributing serology test kits under the policy outlined in Section IV.D of the Policy for Coronavirus Disease-2019 Tests?.

☑ For any UN personnel who are free of symptoms, and returning from country/area or territory experiencing local transmission of COVID-19, managers are encouraged to exercise flexibility in terms of using remote working arrangements for staff in these situations who would like to limit their contact with others and work from home for 14 days post-travel. This is not mandatory but is strongly encouraged.
☑ Individuals returning from areas of outbreaks should be advised to review our health advisory on this Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) page so that you have awareness about the disease. You should monitor yourself daily for signs of fever, respiratory symptoms (e.g., breathing difficulties, cough), and know where to seek medical attention if you are aware of any symptoms within yourself.

How kids react to seeing masks partly depends on their age. Older kids might not
               react much at all. To them, masks might seem like no big deal. Most are able to adjust
               pretty quickly.
Some kids may even be eager to wear a mask.
               They might embrace their new look as a medical superhero.
But for babies, toddlers, and young kids, seeing people in masks might take some
               getting used to. At first, they may feel cautious. They may need a few minutes to
               look and watch. That can help them get used to what's new. They may need a parent
               to gently say, "It's OK." That can help them relax.
Some babies, toddlers, and young kids may feel upset or afraid. They might cry,
               hide their face, or cling to a parent. Soothing words, comfort, and the safety of
               a parent's lap can help calm them. <SEP> How Do Kids React to Masks? <EOS>
Hydrogen peroxide-based systems for cleaning, disinfecting, and storing contact lenses should be effective against the virus that causes COVID-19.

For other disinfection methods, such as multipurpose solution and ultrasonic cleaners, there is currently not enough scientific evidence to determine efficacy against the virus.

All visitors are being screened at the entrances for symptoms of COVID-19:

During the screening your temperature will be taken, and you will be asked a few questions. 
To help you get through the line more quickly, you may also answer screener questions on your phone after you arrive on campus. The link to the online screener will be provided to you before you check in, and the questions are available in multiple languages. 

You will be asked to wear a mask at all times in the hospital. If you don’t have a mask, one will be provided for you. This is required for everyone over the age of 2. 
Everyone is required to maintain six feet of physical distance between non-family members. Waiting rooms and  hospital settings have been adjusted to help make this easier.
We are reminding everyone to wash hands and use hand sanitizer frequently to prevent the spread of germs. Hand sanitizer is available throughout the buildings.

What is CHLA doing to keep my kids and the hospital safe? 
Our team members are specially trained to provide the safest care possible for our young patients, and we are following all Los Angeles County Public Health Department treatment guidelines and protocols to care for patients and protect the medical staff. We are also following the latest guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), including screening and testing efforts. The hospital’s team has the training to manage infectious diseases, and we follow strict infection control processes while treating patients. 
	Children’s Hospital has launched several efforts to protect patients, families and team members. Here are some of the things we’ve put in place: 

All visitors and staff are being screened for symptoms of COVID-19.  
All staff, visitors and patients age 2 and above are required to wear a mask in CHLA clinical buildings. Masks will be provided to all visitors. 
We are testing all patients who are admitted to the hospital , or who are having  procedures that require placement of tubes in the mouth, nose or throat.  
We have strengthened our visitor guidelines to help protect our patients. Only one parent or guardian without symptoms of illness is allowed to visit inpatients and outpatients at a time. One caregiver will be allowed only if a parent or guardian is not available due to illness. Outpatient visitors should avoid bringing siblings or other family members to appointments. Non-family visitors will not be permitted. For full details, please see our Visitor Guidelines.
CHLA has designated areas in the hospital that it may use for isolating COVID-19 patients from other patients and families.  
We have increased our thorough cleaning processes to protect patients, families and team members.
Team members have run drills throughout the hospital to help prepare for all aspects of the pandemic.  
We have been in close contact with local, state and federal authorities, including the Los Angeles County Public Health Department, to stay up to date with the latest outbreak information and  follow the latest practices to limit the spread of COVID-19. 

Should I keep my child's appointment for care? 
It is safe to bring your child to the hospital, and important for them to receive necessary medical care. You should plan to keep your child’s appointment—particularly if the care needs are urgent, emergent or will worsen without timely attention from a health care provider. CHLA is currently reaching out to patients and families to confirm appointments. Some clinics are also offering telehealth visits at this time; the clinic will let you know if this is an option for you.
Is it safe for me and my child to go to the hospital? 
Yes, all areas of the hospital and specialty care clinics remain in operation. Children's Hospital Los Angeles is following all Los Angeles County Public Health Department treatment guidelines and protocols to protect the health of patients and their family members as well as our clinical team and faculty members.
We are in constant contact with local and state health authorities.

To self-quarantine means to separate yourself from others because you have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 even though you, yourself, do not have symptoms.During self-quarantine you monitor yourself
    for symptoms.  The goal of the self-quarantine is to prevent transmission.  Since people who become ill with COVID-19 can infect people immediately self-quarantine can prevent some infections from happening.  .In this case:Have a large, well-ventilated single room with hand hygiene and toilet facilitiesIf this is not available place beds at least 1 metre apart.Keep at least 1-metre distance from others, even from your family members.Monitor your symptoms dailySelf-quarantine for 14 days, even if you feel healthyIf you develop difficulty breathing, contact your healthcare provider immediately – call them first if possible.Stay positive and energized by keeping in touch with loved ones by phone or online, and by exercising yourself at home.However, if you live in an area with malaria or dengue fever it is important that you do not ignore symptoms of fever.  Seek medical help.  When you attend the health facility wear a mask if possible, keep at least 1 metre distant from
            other people and do not touch surfaces with your hands. If it is a child who is sick help the child stick to this advice. <SEP> What should I do if I have no symptoms, but I think I have been exposed to COVID-19? What does it mean to self-quarantine? <EOS>

It’s very hard to make healthcare-ready PPE. Local businesses and hobbyists should be advised to manufacture for the public market than try to make healthcare-quality masks. Other local industries may have stockpiles of certified equipment that could go to healthcare workers. The community can come together to make masks and other protective equipment for essential workers outside healthcare. (Dr. Josh Sharfstein, 4/6/20)
The best way to get PPE to healthcare workers is to work with the community to apply political pressure to get the healthcare certified PPE supply chain moving. There are reports of significant changes to the process many of you are likely familiar with and it is often falling on Governor’s offices to get supply satisfied. So it’s incumbent to work with state as well as city emergency management offices.

At this time, there is no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 can spread to people from the skin or fur of pets. Normal cleanliness and hygiene should be maintained for your pet. As a general precaution it is recommended that you wash your hands with soap and water after touching animals. <SEP> Can animals carry the virus that causes COVID-19 on their skin and fur? <EOS>
We often talk about outbreaks in terms of the proportion of a population that is affected. Important factors in determining the proportion of a population that is affected include population density (the proximity of an infectious person to others influences disease transmission), public health interventions (which reduce the likelihood of exposure), and medical infrastructure/capacity (which determines our ability to treat and prevent death in those that are severely ill).
Population size does not directly impact the proportion of a population that will be affected. Factors that would determine proportion affected, especially when it comes to COVID-19, are the population's demographics (e.g. age and existing chronic medical conditions like heart disease, diabetes, lung disease, immune compromised).

These are unusual times, so the usual rules about micromanaging go out the window. You need to go through what's actually happening in the budget at a level of detail that is much different from business as usual, given the fiscal outlook. You can start by giving your finance team the numbers from the Congressional Budget Office and saying, "This is what we're seeing, and this is what the CBO is predicting, and this is what we know happened in 2008, where it took five years to crawl out of this."
To the extent that you're trying to help the departments be effective and offering activity-based budgeting as a better tool for thinking about how to cut the fat and not the bone, they will probably come along. Not every department is going to be as helpful as others, but you can get them to meet you some of the way. (Linda Bilmes, 5/13/20)
This is the most difficult fiscal period you will face.

The CDC’s updated infection prevention and control guidance (as of March 10) notes that face masks are an acceptable alternative when the supply chain of respirators cannot meet the demand. In this case, respirators should be prioritized for procedures likely to generate respiratory aerosols, which pose the highest risk to health care professionals.
If there are shortages of gowns, they should be prioritized for aerosol-generating procedures, care activities where splashes and sprays are anticipated, and high-contact patient care activities that provide opportunities for transfer of pathogens to the hands and clothing of HCP.

After emergency  management services (EMS) pronounces the death of someone on site, you can hire  a funeral director, or New York City's Office of Chief Medical Examiner (OCME)  can collect and temporarily store the body. If OCME transported the body, you  can follow up by calling OCME at 212-447-2030. When prompted, choose the  option for "families" which will direct you to the correct department.
OCME's Family  Services Centers are located in all five boroughs of NYC. Families may be asked  to visit a Family Services Center to complete a visual identification when  required, or to provide or receive additional case information.

We are still learning about this virus and how it spreads, but it appears it can spread from humans to animals in some situations. The CDC is aware of a very small number of pets reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 after close contact with people with COVID-19, however, there is no evidence that pets, including cats and dogs, play a significant role in spreading COVID-19 to people. The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person, typically through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking.
People sick with COVID-19 should isolate themselves from other people and animals, including pets, during their illness until we know more about how this virus affects animals. If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wear a cloth face covering and wash your hands before and after you interact with pets.
Keep pets indoors when possible to prevent them from interacting with other animals or people.

Exercising poses a potential risk from SARS-CoV-2 infection to athletes and coaches. This is particularly an issue in settings where athletes train in groups, engage in contact sports, share equipment or use common areas, including locker rooms. Community and individual-level recreational sport activities could also potentially heighten the risk of spreading coronavirus. Transmission could occur through person-to-person contact, exposure to a common source, or aerosols/droplets from an infected individual. Nevertheless, in light of the benefits of regular physical activity to physical and mental health it is important to remain active during the COVID-19 pandemic while respecting physical distancing and personal hygiene recommendations.

Unemployment benefits are available to individuals who are unemployed through no fault of their own. If an employer must shut down operations and no work is available, individuals may be eligible for unemployment benefits if they meet the monetary criteria. Employees who are working reduced hours may be eligible and must report their gross wages at the time they are earned, not paid. Delaware makes no distinction between part time and full time employees who are completely unemployed. <SEP> Will Workers Qualify For Unemployment Benefits If The Coronavirus (Covid-19) Causes An Employer To Slow Down Or Cease Operations? <EOS>
Until we know more about how this virus affects animals, CDC encourages pet owners to treat pets as you would other human family members to protect them from possible infection. This means limiting contact between your pets and people outside your household as much as possible and avoiding places where large numbers of people gather.
Some areas are allowing groomers and boarding facilities such as dog daycares to open. If you must take your pet to a groomer or boarding facility, follow any protocols put into place at the facility, such as wearing a mask and maintaining at least 6 feet of space between yourself and others if possible.
Limit pet items brought from home to the groomer or boarding facility, and disinfect any objects that are taken into a facility and returned home (such as leashes, bowls, and toys). Use an EPA-registered disinfectantexternal icon to clean items and rinse thoroughly with clean water afterwards. Do not wipe or bathe your pet with chemical disinfectants, alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or any other products not approved for animal use.
Do not put masks on pets, and do not take a sick pet to a groomer or boarding facility. Signs of sickness in animals may include:

Fever
Coughing
Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath
Lethargy
Sneezing
Nasal/ocular discharge
Vomiting
Diarrhea

If you think your pet is sick, call your veterinarian. Some veterinarians may offer telemedicine consultations or other plans for seeing sick pets. Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your pet’s treatment and care.

Based on limited data, high-flow oxygen use is not considered an aerosol-generating procedure for respirator prioritization during shortages over procedures more likely to generate higher concentrations of infectious respiratory aerosols (such as bronchoscopy, intubation, and open suctioning). Patients with known or suspected COVID-19 should receive any interventions they would normally receive as standard of care. When respirator supplies are restored, as with all clinical care activities for patients with known or suspected COVID-19, respirators (or facemasks if a respirator is not available), eye protection, gloves, and gowns should be used by HCP for the care of pregnant patients with known or suspected COVID-19. For more information please see: Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control FAQs <SEP> Is use of high-flow oxygen considered an aerosol-generating procedure for respirator prioritization during shortages? <EOS>
If HCP with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 decline testing, they should be presumed to have COVID-19 and excluded from work. Return to work decisions should be based on COVID-19 return to work guidance at the discretion of the facility’s occupational health program.
If asymptomatic HCP decline testing, work restriction, if any, should be determined by the facility’s occupational health and local jurisdiction policies. All staff should be trained in proper use of personal protective equipment, including universal facemask policies, hand hygiene, and other measures needed to stop transmission of SARS-CoV-2. <SEP> How should facilities approach HCP who decline testing? <EOS>
How you show up, your body language, and your general demeanor and energy make a difference.

We need to get comfortable with a lot of uncertainty and chaos, with too little information and changing information, give others permission to not know what to do, and remind everyone that we are navigating point to point. We're not navigating to August then through to December and then through to the first vaccines in 2021 on some kind of GPS printout. We're navigating only to the next point, which is usually the point through which we think the waves are lowest and the winds the slowest.
We're going to pivot when we make mistakes, and we're going to learn from that pivot, and then we're going to navigate to the next point. You can't spend a lot of time thinking, “Oh my God, why did we make that mistake?” or casting blame. We learn and we move forward, point to point, and we need our teams and our citizens, to become comfortable with that kind of navigation.

The answer depends on whether you're looking at the fatality rate (the risk of death among those who are infected) or the total number of deaths.Regarding the fatality rate, it appears that the risk of death with the pandemic coronavirus infection (commonly estimated at about 1%) is far less than it was for SARS (approximately 11%) and MERS (about 35%), but will likely be higher than the risk from seasonal flu (which averages about 0.1%). We will have a more accurate estimate of fatality rate for this coronavirus infection once testing becomes more routine.What we do know so far is the risk of death very much depends on your age and your overall health. Children appear to be at very low risk of severe disease and death. Older adults and those who smoke or have chronic diseases such as diabetes or heart disease have a higher chance of developing complications like pneumonia, which could be deadly. <SEP> How deadly is COVID-19? <EOS>
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act of 2020 (CARES Act) includes three key programs for workers affected by the Coronavirus.
Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC)

If there is spread of COVID-19 in the community close to your facility, consider suspending contact visits. If contact visits continue, all potential visitors should be asked:

“Today or in the past 24 hours, have you had any of the following symptoms? Fever, felt feverish, or had chills? Cough? Difficulty breathing?”
“In the past 14 days, have you had contact with a person known to be infected with the novel coronavirus (COVID-19)?”

Staff should also perform temperature checks for all visitors and volunteers. Any visitor who answers yes to one of these questions or who declines screening should not be allowed into the facility. When possible, facilities should let potential visitors know about these rules before they travel to the facility. Facilities can place posters in visiting areas and ask people who are incarcerated to inform their family members and visitors about these rules. <SEP> Should I allow visitors into the facility if there is spread of COVID-19 in the community close to my facility? <EOS>
Tantalizing, right? And spending money in local businesses is a great way to jumpstart the economy. 
However, an open restaurant doesn’t mean a safe restaurant, either for you or for other people. And a quick look at cities and states that reopened their public spaces earlier suggests that it’s not safe to go without a mask, or to be around those who aren’t wearing them. 
Already, open restaurants have been linked to viral spread. The food itself if not the problem. It’s customers, whose laughter and talking can spew viral droplets throughout the area and all over waiters and staff.
If you want to eat restaurant food, consider getting it as take out. That way you can support a local business, see your friends and avoid having to cook — without as many ethical or safety concerns. <SEP> Restaurants are open and I really do not want to cook anymore. What should I consider? <EOS>
Employees have specific rights related to working conditions and leave provisions that are outlined in collective agreements and Treasury Board policies. If employees require assistance in understanding these provisions, they should talk to their manager/supervisor or their union representative.

Some people infected with the virus have no symptoms. When the virus does cause symptoms, common ones include fever, body ache, dry cough, fatigue, chills, headache, sore throat, loss of appetite, and loss of smell. In some people, COVID-19 causes more severe symptoms like high fever, severe cough, and shortness of breath, which often indicates pneumonia.People with COVID-19 are also experiencing neurological symptoms, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, or both. These may occur with or without respiratory symptoms.For example, COVID-19 affects brain function in some people. Specific neurological symptoms seen in people with COVID-19 include loss of smell, inability to taste, muscle weakness, tingling or numbness in the hands and feet, dizziness, confusion, delirium, seizures, and stroke.In addition, some people have gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, such as loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain or discomfort associated with COVID-19. These symptoms might start before other symptoms such as fever, body ache, and cough.

Yes. Routinely cleaning and disinfecting equipment and frequently touched surfaces is important to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Even though getting COVID-19 by touching an object that has the virus on it and then touching your mouth, nose, or possibly your eyes is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads, we are still learning more about this virus.
Therefore, CDC recommends that you clean and disinfect equipment and frequently touched surfaces on or around the field, court, or play surface such as drinking fountains at least daily, or between uses as much as possible. Shared objects and equipment such as balls, bats, gymnastics equipment, and protective gear should be cleaned and disinfected between use by different individuals if possible. For more information, refer to the Considerations for Youth Sports. Additionally, CDC recommends the use of disinfectants on the Environmental Protection Agency’s List Nexternal iconexternal icon, which includes about 400 disinfectants that are effective against the virus that causes COVID-19.
Another effective way to decrease the risk of COVID-19 spread is to discourage the sharing of items that are difficult to clean or disinfect. One way to do this is to be sure that you have adequate supplies to minimize sharing of equipment (such as protective gear, balls, bats, water bottles). If it is not possible to have dedicated equipment for each player, limit use of supplies and equipment to one smaller group of players at a time and clean and disinfect those supplies and equipment between use.

In non-health care settings, sodium hypochlorite (bleach / chlorine) may be used at a recommended concentration of 0.1% or 1,000ppm (1 part of 5% strength household bleach to 49 parts of water). Alcohol at 70-90% can also be used for surface disinfection. Surfaces must be cleaned with water and soap or a detergent first to remove dirt, followed by disinfection.  Cleaning should always start from the least soiled (cleanest) area to the most soiled (dirtiest) area in order to not spread the dirty to areas that are less soiled. All disinfectant solutions should be stored in opaque containers, in a well-ventilated, covered area that is not exposed to direct sunlight and ideally should be freshly prepared every day.In indoor spaces, routine application of disinfectants to surfaces via spraying is not recommended for COVID-19.

In light of a Presidential Memorandum on making  general-use respirators available for healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic,  OSHA has issued temporary enforcement guidance for the Respiratory Protection standard  (29 CFR 1910.134) for: 

Required annual fit-testing.
Supply  shortages of disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirators.
Use  of respiratory protection equipment certified under standards of other countries.
Decontamination of filtering  facepiece respirators in healthcare.

OSHA enforcement guidance describes additional measures employers can take to ensure workers have appropriate respiratory protection during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Although OSHA's enforcement guidance describes equipment prioritization that includes surgical masks as potential considerations in some circumstances when respirators are  not available, employers must still comply with the provisions of any standards  that apply to the types of exposures their workers may face. For example,  the permissible exposure limits of all substance-specific standards, such as asbestos and silica, remain in place,  and surgical masks are not an acceptable means of protection when respirators  would otherwise be required (e.g., when engineering, administrative, and work  practice controls do not sufficiently control exposures).
If respirators are needed but not available (including as described in the OSHA enforcement guidance noted above), and hazards cannot otherwise be adequately  controlled through other elements of the hierarchy of controls (i.e.,  elimination, substitution, engineering controls, administrative controls,  and/or safe work practices), avoid worker exposure to the hazard. Whenever a  hazard presents an imminent danger, and in additional situations whenever  feasible, the task should be delayed until feasible control measures are  available to prevent exposures or reduce them to acceptable levels (i.e., at or  below applicable OSHA permissible exposure limits).
The CDC/National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory (NPPTL),  provides additional information on SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and PPE. <SEP> My organization is experiencing a supply  shortage of N95 filtering facepiece respirators.

 Facilities performing COVID-19 testing must be certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, or CLIA, which is administered by CMS. https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/CLIA/ 
FDA has issued a number of Emergency Use Authorizations for COVID-19 tests. All COVID-19 tests that are authorized under an EUA can be found on our EUA website. Laboratories authorized to use such tests are subject to various conditions that can be found in the EUA.
Each EUA also includes the settings in which the test is authorized. For ease of reference, the settings authorized in the EUAs are also noted in the EUA table on the EUA page. Tests that are noted with an "H" in the Authorized Settings are limited to use in laboratories certified under CLIA that meet requirements to perform high-complexity tests. Tests that are noted with an "H" and "M" in the Authorized Settings may be performed in laboratories certified under CLIA to perform high complexity and/or moderate complexity tests. Tests that are noted with a "W" in the Authorized Settings are deemed to be CLIA-waived for use in patient care settings operating under a CLIA Certificate of Waiver. Tests noted with an "H," "M," and "W may be used in laboratories certified under CLIA that meet requirements to perform high complexity and/or moderate complexity tests and in patient care settings operating under a CLIA Certificate of Waiver.
Test kits being offered prior to an EUA under the policies outlined in the FDA's Policy for Coronavirus Disease-2019 Tests have not yet been reviewed by the FDA, are not FDA authorized, and have not received a CLIA categorization. Unless and until an EUA is issued that authorizes additional testing environments for a specific test, under CLIA, use of that test is limited to laboratories certified to perform high complexity testing, and at the point-of-care when covered by the laboratory's CLIA certificate for high-complexity testing.
FDA is not involved in the distribution or allocation of tests.

Some airplanes have cabin air filtration systems equipped with HEPA filters which can remove viruses and germs quickly, minimizing the duration of the exposure to any potential infectious materials produced by a cough or sneeze. The cabin air system is designed to operate most efficiently by delivering approximately 50 percent outside air and 50 percent filtered, recirculated air. The air supply is essentially sterile and particle-free.  However, adequate ventilation is just one of the preventive measures to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission.  Other important measures include maintaining physical distance of at least 1 meter whenever possible, frequent hand hygiene and wearing a mask.

One strategy we've used in Baltimore is building on our relationships with well-known members of the various communities, like community partners who have worked on providing services to individuals with HIV/AIDS or women in childbirth. We work closely with them to make sure we hear about what myths are circulating and then ask them to serve as messengers. Some high school students in Baltimore on a step team choreographed and filmed a socially-distanced dance routine that called on people in the African American community to wear masks outside and wash their hands.
So we have to get creative when talking to different people in different groups, including immigrant populations, asking them what we think would resonate most.

The State of New Jersey has created a benefits eligibility tool to help you understand what benefits programs and job protections are available to you during the COVID-19 outbreak.
You can also visit nj.gov/labor and read about the state and federal laws and benefit programs that may apply to you. There you will also find a helpful chart clarifying the different scenarios and the available benefits in English and Spanish as well as 13 other languages.
Programs Available To Help
NJ Earned Sick Leave, emergency federal paid sick and emergency FMLA childcare leave are paid by your employer directly. Unemployment, Temporary Disability and Family Leave benefits require an application to the State of NJ. Individuals should apply for the program that best fits their situation as applying for the wrong one could cause delays.
New Jersey is providing 20 weeks of extended unemployment to New Jersey workers who have exhausted their state and federal jobless benefits. The state extension kicks in after claimants exhaust 26 weeks of state unemployment plus 13 weeks of federal Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUC), described below. Eligible claimants can now receive up to 59 weeks of unemployment benefits.
Claimants will be automatically enrolled into extended benefits as their federal extension ends. They do not need to contact an agent or reapply.
Additional COVID-19 Benefits
As a result of federal legislation, New Jersey's unemployment system can provide more benefits and help those who are not typically eligible:

Independent contractors, the self-employed, "gig" workers, and those looking for part-time work, are eligible (known as "Pandemic Unemployment Assistance")
Those who, under normal circumstances, don't have enough work history or who have exhausted regular Unemployment benefits, are eligible (known as "Pandemic Unemployment Assistance")
Up until July 25, Unemployment Insurance provided an additional $600 per week, on top of regular and Pandemic Unemployment Assistance benefits (known as "Pandemic Unemployment Compensation"). Benefits are continuing to be issued for any eligible weeks, April 4 through July 25. The distribution of additional benefits is dependent on Congressional action.

New Jersey workers who have experienced any of the following, but not limited to, COVID-19 situations are likely eligible for help through Pandemic Unemployment Assistance:

Workers sick, quarantined, or exposed to COVID-19
Workers who need to take care of a family member or household member who has been diagnosed with COVID-19
Workers who are the primary caregiver for a child or family member unable to attend school or another facility closed due to COVID-19
Workers who lost employment or hours due to COVID-19

The NJ Department of Labor submitted an application to FEMA for Lost Wages Assistance (LWA). LWA allows for temporary supplemental financial support to those whose jobs or wages have been adversely affected by COVID-19, providing up to $300/week to eligible individuals, in addition to their weekly benefit. Pending FEMA approval, the first round of the grant would provide up to $300/week to claimants collecting for August 1, 8, and 15. If the application is approved, instructions on how to apply will be posted based on FEMA guidance.
How to Apply
To apply, visit myunemployment.nj.gov.
Applicants will be assessed first for traditional unemployment insurance benefits. If traditional unemployment benefits are not applicable to that worker, the application may be denied first and then assessed by NJ Department of Labor for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance benefits.
Please note that it is not possible to save your online application and return to it; you must complete it and submit it all at once. Once you've submitted your application, you will receive a confirmation number at the end of your application; please record this. You will receive instructions on how and when to claim benefits.
Claimants for unemployment assistance must certify for these benefits online each week. The certification schedule -- based on Social Security number -- can be found at myunemployment.nj.gov.

Face coverings are currently mandatory on public transport, and in shops, supermarkets, indoor shopping centres, banks, building societies, post offices, and indoor transport hubs.
From 8 August, you will also be required to wear face coverings in a greater number of public indoor settings such as museums, galleries, cinemas, places of worship, and public libraries. Relevant guidance on face coverings is available here.
People are also strongly encouraged to wear face coverings in any other enclosed public spaces where there are people they do not normally meet.
You do not need to wear a face covering if you have a legitimate reason not to. This includes (but is not limited to):

children under 11
because of a physical or mental illness or impairment, or disability
to communicate with someone who relies on lip reading
to avoid harm or injury; to identify yourself
to eat or drink if necessary

You can carry something that says you do not have to wear a face covering for medical reasons. This is a personal choice, and is not necessary in law - you should not routinely be required to produce any written evidence to justify the fact you are not wearing a face covering.
Relevant guidance on face coverings is available here <SEP> 3.18 Do I have to wear a face covering in public? <EOS>
As with other financial and performance reports, NIH will allow delayed submission of Annual Usage Reports for S10 recipients. When equipment usage is affected by COVID-19, recipients should report those effects in their reports, when discussing machine downtime and any changes in operation. NIH will consider the effects of COVID-19 on these activities in its review of reports received. Recipients should contact the funding IC to notify them of anticipated delays. <SEP> 5.

On March 23, 2020, Governor Northam issued Executive Order #53 closing all K-12 schools for the remainder of the academic year.  The Virginia Department of Education (VDOE) has issued  guidance to help localities execute plans to continue instruction, while ensuring students are served equitably, regardless of income level, access to technology, English learner status, or special needs. This includes options for additional instruction through summer programming, integrating instruction into coursework next year, and allowing students to make up content. VDOE will submit a waiver to the federal government to lift end-of-year testing requirements and is exploring options to waive state mandated tests.
School closures are one form of social distancing. Children and families are also encouraged to practice social distancing in their daily lives while schools are closed. Social distancing means remaining out of:

Public places where close contact with others may occur (such as shopping centers, movie theaters, stadiums).
Workplaces (unless the person works in an office space that allows distancing from others).
Schools and other classroom settings.

Please visit the Virginia’s Department of Education FAQs for more information:.  DOE FAQs <SEP> Is it okay for my child to go to school? <EOS>
Closures
New Jersey has temporarily closed congregate day programs for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities.
The Division of Developmental Disabilities has issued guidance and published an FAQ document on day program closures and discontinued community outings related to COVID-19.
For additional information and the latest updates, visit the Department of Human Services' COVID-19 Updates page.
Visitation
Visitors can meet with loved ones in both indoor and outdoor settings at group homes so long as individuals and facilities adhere to the required social distancing and safety protocols issued by the NJ Division of Developmental Disabilities.
Safety guidelines for visits with family and friends for residential providers include:

All visits must be scheduled in advance with the residential provider.
No more than two visitors shall be permitted at any one time.
Indoor visits within a residence may only occur when there have been no residents or staff of the home who have tested positive for COVID-19 in the last 28 consecutive days or are currently displaying symptoms.
Outdoor visits may only occur when it has been at least 14 days since a resident or staff of the home tested positive for COVID-19 and no residents or staff of the home are currently displaying symptoms.
All visitors must be screened, including temperature checks.
All participants must remain at least six feet apart
All participants must wear a face covering
After a visit in space controlled by the provider concludes, the provider shall clean and disinfect all areas and surfaces following CDC guidelines
No resident, current staff of the home or person(s) planning to visit have tested positive, been symptomatic for COVID-19 within the last 14 days, or been in close contact (within six feet for 10 minutes) within the last 14 days with someone who recently tested positive for COVID-19

For a full list of safety requirements, refer to the Division's Guidance for Residential Providers on Visits with Family and Friends, and for specific visitation protocols and hours contact the residential provider directly.
Support During Hospitalization
To better support individuals with disabilities during this public health crisis, in circumstances where support is essential, the Department of Health has made some accommodations during hospitalization.

A designated healthy support person is permitted to be with an individual with a disability during hospitalization. The designated support person may be a family member, personal care assistant or another disability service provider.
Healthy is defined as individuals with no signs of respiratory illness such as fever, cough or shortness of breath. They should not have had contact with anyone with or suspected of having COVID-19 or any respiratory illness and individuals should be wearing the appropriate protective equipment.

Testing
Beginning the week of April 27, the State started testing all residents and staff at all five State Residential Developmental Centers for COVID-19 using the new saliva-based testing developed by Rutgers University. As of May 20, Developmental Centers have completed testing in their facilities, and the Department of Health is now working together to improve access to testing in group homes.
The Division of Developmental Disabilities regularly publishes information about COVID-19 cases including deaths and numbers of cases by county. That information along with the latest updates from the Division can be found on the Department of Human Services' COVID-19 Updates page.

Flu season severity, onset, and peak vary from year-to-year and are difficult to predict.  The CDC’s Influenza Division monitors influenza activity throughout the year and issues weekly surveillance reports during flu season. The CDC also updates an interactive online application, FluView Interactive, for more in-depth data. Cities can use these tools to monitor flu activity and severity. In recent years, the CDC started publishing these reports in late September or early October.
Additionally, U.S. health officials sometimes observe Australia’s flu season, which usually begins in June, as an potential indicator for severity of the upcoming U.S. flu season. Though, in some years, the flu season in the US and Australia differs in terms of severity, due to changes in the virus.

If you develop signs of the coronavirus (COVID-19) virus while staying in overnight accommodation you should inform the accommodation provider immediately, immediately self-isolate where you are to minimise any risk of transmission, and request a test by calling 119 or online at nhs.uk. If your test is positive you should return home as quickly and directly as possible.  You should use private transport but only drive yourself if you can do so safely.
Avoid using public transport in order to reduce the spread of the virus.  If you cannot avoid using public transport, you should continue to self-isolate in your accommodation and call 111 for further advice.
In most cases it will not be possible to self-isolate at your holiday accommodation. In these cases, you should make arrangements to travel home as safely as possible, while minimising the risk to others.
Only, if it is agreed with the accommodation provider can you extend your stay in order to self-isolate until you are well enough to travel.  Unless otherwise provided for in the contractual terms of the booking, you will be expected to pay the costs of an extended stay in all but exceptional circumstances.
Once home, you should continue to follow the government guidance on self-isolation, household isolation and social distancing. <SEP> 3.4 What happens if I become unwell while on holiday in England? <EOS>

There are many sources of data that researchers have used for a long time that could help inform a strategy. Things like occupational data, for example, can tell you where your essential workers live. You can use municipal records to estimate the percentage of multi-generational homes, or work with food distribution sites to learn which schools provide free lunch to a large number of children and which families are getting food supplements. You can a lot of information from publicly available datasets, and that will help you figure out where you need to target your efforts.

You should try not to share a vehicle with those outside your household or social bubble. If you need to, try to:

share the transport with the same people each time
keep to small groups of people at any one time
open windows for ventilation
travel side by side or behind other people, rather than facing them, where seating arrangements allow
face away from each other
consider seating arrangements to maximise distance between people in the vehicle
clean your car between journeys using standard cleaning products - make sure you clean door handles and other areas that people may touch
ask the driver and passengers to wear a face covering

Please see their guidance on private cars and other vehicles for more information on car sharing and traveling with people outside your household group. <SEP> 2.4 Can I share a private vehicle with someone from another household? <EOS>
If you are in close contact with someone who you know has COVID-19, call your doctor immediately. They will likely advise you to isolate yourself for 14 days. If you don't get any symptoms within that 14-day period, your doctor will likely conclude that you don’t have the disease. 
If you've only recently been exposed to COVID-19, any diagnostic test might come back negative. Typically, your doctor will advise you to wait a couple of days before coming in for testing, unless you are already showing symptoms. <SEP> What if I come into contact with someone who has COVID-19? <EOS>
Any child who has symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 should wear a medical mask, as long as they can tolerate it. The child should be isolated, and medical advice sought as soon as they start to feel unwell, even if symptoms are mild. Family members/caregivers who come within 1 metre of the sick child at home should also wear a mask.  A household member who is sick or has tested positive with the virus that causes COVID-19 should be isolated from everyone else if possible. If the child comes within 1 metre of the sick person at home, the adult and child should wear a medical mask during that time. <SEP> Should a child wear a mask at home? <EOS>
Contact tracing is the process of identifying, assessing, and managing people who have been exposed to a disease to prevent onward transmission. These people are called contacts. Contact tracing for COVID-19 requires identifying people who may have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and following them daily for 14 days. The goal is to stop transmission of the virus by reducing the number of people who are circulating with the virus. <SEP> What is contact tracing? <EOS>

If Covered at Your Provider’s Office. Your insurer must cover your telehealth service if the service would have been covered if you went to your provider’s office or facility. However, your insurer may require telehealth services to be provided by an in-network provider.
No Cost-Sharing for COVID-19 Diagnosis. The Department of Financial Services issued a regulation so you will not have to pay your copayment, coinsurance, or deductible when you receive in-network telehealth services to diagnose COVID-19.
No Cost-Sharing for Other Treatment. The Department of Financial Services issued a regulation so that during the State of Emergency declared by Governor Cuomo for COVID-19, you will not have to pay your copayment, coinsurance, or deductible when you receive in-network telehealth services. This includes treatment of COVID-19 and any other health care services that are unrelated to COVID-19 if the services would have been covered if you went to your provider’s office or facility. Contact your insurer for more information if you have a high deductible plan.
Telephone Calls and Videos Included in Telehealth. The Department of Financial Services issued guidance on the ways you may receive telehealth services.

While the risks of COVID-19 from contact with such animals are considered very low, it is nonetheless prudent that caregivers use the best available information on general infection prevention for contagious diseases, including coronaviruses.

Whenever possible, entry into the home where a person with COVID-19 lived should be avoided in order to prevent person-to-person transmission. Companion animals should be collected with minimal contact with people living in the home. This includes remaining a minimum of 6 feet away from other people and limiting contact with the home environment.

If collection of the animal means interacting with people from COVID-19 infected households or being exposed to home environments that might be contaminated with the virus, public health officials may recommend personal protective equipment (PPE) and provide training in the proper use of such equipment. Consult with your local health department.


Wash hands with soap and water or use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol before and after handling a companion animal.
If an animal needs to be housed in an animal shelter, veterinary clinic, or boarding facility, gloves and gowns or coveralls should be worn while performing routine intake exams and treatments in order to reduce contagious disease risks.

Gloves and gowns or coveralls are a good infection prevention control practice generally, and continue to be important during the COVID-19 pandemic. Gowns or coveralls should be laundered before reuse if going to be reused.
Hands should always be washed with soap and water including after gloves are removed and discarded.
The animal intake area as well as materials in animal areas such as food and water bowls and bedding should be routinely cleaned and sanitized.
There is no need to bathe an animal because of COVID-19 concerns; at this time, there is no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 can spread to people from the skin or fur of pets.
Animals that were in contact with COVID-19 should be separated from the general animal population during the animal’s stay due to the unknown risks associated with this rapidly evolving emerging infectious disease.

Every effort should be made to promptly reunite sheltered companion animals with their owners.
Animals that need to be adopted or sent to a foster home should be held for 14 days out of an abundance of caution.


Dogs should be walked outside for elimination and exercise but direct contact with other companion animals should be avoided as a best practice to protect animal health.
Routine cleaning and disinfection is important in animal areas. Cleaning of visibly dirty surfaces followed by disinfection is a best practice measure. Normal cleaning and disinfection protocols for both animal housing and common areas used in shelters are sufficient. Increased sanitation of surfaces frequently touched by people (e.g. light switches and door knobs) is recommended to reduce exposure to/from humans. <SEP> If a person or facility cares for a pet that has had contact with someone diagnosed with COVID-19, should any precautions be taken by the caregiver? <EOS>
The CDC currently recommends avoiding all non-essential travel to China. If you must travel, check your government’s travel website for specific advisories. When visiting China or other areas affected by the coronavirus, stay away from animals and sick people. Wash your hands frequently with warm water and soap, or use hand sanitizer if soap and water aren’t available. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth, especially if you haven’t cleaned your hands recently. If you've recently traveled to China or another area when the coronavirus is active and you experience symptoms of illness, see your doctor immediately. Let them know about your recent travel. <SEP> How do you prevent coronavirus while traveling? <EOS>
 The use of a face shield complies as long as it covers the nostrils and mouth. The shield must extend just past the chin in order to fully cover the mouth. They should wrap around the sides of the wearer's face. Disposable face shields should only be worn for a single use. Reusuable face shields should be cleaned and disinfected after each use.

While the elderly and those with certain underlying health conditions are most at risk for severe COVID-19, many young, healthy people are also becoming very ill and requiring hospitalization, or even dying.
Scientists have built models to predict the outcome of different isolation strategies. Based on these models, only isolating those most at risk is not sufficient to slow the outbreak and prevent our healthcare systems from being overwhelmed. In order to keep the outbreak manageable for healthcare systems, social distancing (staying physically far away from one another, at least 6 feet) of the entire population, among other measures, are necessary.

Given the risks to health that tobacco use causes, WHO recommends quitting tobacco use.  Quitting will help your lungs and heart to work better from the moment you stop.  Within 20 minutes of quitting, elevated heart rate and blood pressure drop. After 12 hours, the carbon monoxide level in the bloodstream drops to normal. Within 2-12 weeks, circulation improves and lung function increases. After 1-9 months, coughing and shortness of breath decrease. Quitting will help to protect your loved ones, especially children, from exposure to second-hand smoke. WHO recommends the use of proven interventions such as toll-free quit lines, mobile text-messaging cessation programmes, and nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs), among others, for quitting tobacco use. <SEP> What does WHO recommend for tobacco users? <EOS>
The virus enters your body via your eyes, nose and/or mouth, so it is important to avoid touching your face with unwashed hands.
Washing of hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or cleaning hands thoroughly with alcohol-based solutions, gels or tissues is recommended in all settings. It is also recommended to stay one metre or more away from people infected with COVID-19 who are showing symptoms, to reduce the risk of infection through respiratory droplets. <SEP> 1. How can I avoid getting infected? <EOS>
CDC & VDH recommend strict infection prevention and control practices in all healthcare settings, including outpatient clinics. Early detection (triage) and isolation of any suspected/confirmed COVID-19 patients is the key to avoid unnecessary exposure. Putting clear signs at the entrance/triage of your clinic is strongly recommended.
Healthcare facilities should consider implementing policies requiring everyone entering the facility to wear a cloth face covering (if tolerated) while in the building, regardless of symptoms. This approach is consistent with a recommendation to the general public advising them to wear a cloth face covering whenever they cannot maintain social distancing.
Ensure your personnel are trained on proper infection prevention and control practices like hand hygiene, PPE selection, donning/doffing, and environmental cleaning and disinfection. When evaluating a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patient, healthcare providers should utilize standard, contact and airborne isolation precautions in addition to eye protection. Patients should be evaluated in airborne infection isolation rooms, and if not available, patients should be placed in a private room with the door closed. Additional information for healthcare providers is included on the VDH website.

The truth is that the fewer people you and your children are exposed to, the better. However, the reality is that not every family will be able to have a parent at home at all times.All people can do is try to minimize the risk by doing things like:
choosing a babysitter who has minimal exposures to other people besides your family
limiting the number of babysitters. If you can keep it to one, that's ideal, but if not keep the number as low as possible
making sure that the babysitter understands that he or she needs to practice social distancing, and needs to let you know (and not come to your house!) if he or she feels at all sick or has a known exposure to COVID-19
having the babysitter limit physical interactions and closeness with your children, to the extent that this is possible

Public health surveillance is the ongoing, systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of health-related data essential to planning, implementation, and evaluation of public health practice.
For surveillance of COVID-19 and the virus that causes it, SARS-CoV-2, CDC is using multiple surveillance systems in collaboration with state, local, territorial, academic, and commercial partners to monitor COVID-19 in the United States. COVID-19 surveillance draws from a combination of data sources using existing influenza and viral respiratory disease surveillance, syndromic surveillance, case reporting, lab reporting, the healthcare safety system, ongoing research platforms, and other new surveillance systems designed to answer specific questions. The data from these systems, combined, create an updated picture of COVID-19’s spread and its effects in the United States and are used to inform the U.S. national public health response to COVID-19. <SEP> How does CDC collect COVID-19 surveillance data? <EOS>

Governor Ralph Northam’s guidelines for reopening Virginia is a three-phase plan.  Phase One, “safer at home” was implemented on May 15, 2020.  Virginia is now in Phase Three  Phase Three began on July 1, 2020.
Under phase one of the plan, general guidelines for “safer at home” included continued social distancing, continued teleworking, and continued use of face coverings in public.  Non-essential businesses like restaurants and salons  reopened with limited capacity.  Restrictions are a floor and communities may not be ready to take these steps and will have stricter regulations.  Businesses must remain closed if they cannot meet the requirements set forth in the guidance.  Restrictions are meant to protect workers.
Some parts of the state may keep coronavirus-related restrictions in place longer than the rest of the state.

Please follow the instructions from your testing site on how to get your test results.
Pharmacies, local testing sites, physician's offices, hospitals, and other testing sites operate independently from the State. Neither the Department of Health, the 2-1-1 call center, nor the COVID-19 questions hotline are able to inform patients of their test results.
Some testing sites have arranged to work with laboratories to create patient portals that allow people who have been tested to look up their results online (BioReference, LabCorp, Quest). The testing site where you got tested will inform you if this is an option for their site. All testing sites are required to give the result to the facility or physician that ordered your test.
With the current high volume of tests, patients with positive tests will receive priority notification so that they can begin treatment, self-quarantine or other measures as instructed by their healthcare provider. <SEP> I was tested for COVID-19. How do I get my results? <EOS>
There are definitely risks, but also steps you and the gym can take to help minimize the risks. 
Coronavirus often spreads more easily indoors rather than outdoors — especially if you’re indoors for an extended period of time. 
Researchers have also found that heavy breathing and singing can propel aerosolized viral particles farther and increase the risk of transmission. 
During one fitness instructor workshop, about 30 participants with no symptoms trained intensely for four hours, according to research published by the CDC. Eight participants later tested positive, and more than 100 new cases of coronavirus were traced back to that fitness workshop.
To help mitigate the risk, many gyms are now limiting capacity. Some are providing members with disinfectant sprays to sanitize equipment. 
While health experts have recommended staying 6 feet away from others, it’s smart to keep even more distance than that at the gym. 
“With all the heavy breathing, you may even want to double the usual 6 feet to 12 feet, just to be safe,” CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said. <SEP> Is it safe to go back to the gym? <EOS>
Reopening is driven by public health data. Before Massachusetts can begin reopening, key public health metrics must indicate it is appropriate to do so.
When will it be safe to move to the next phase?
During each phase of reopening, public health metrics must indicate it is appropriate to move to the next phase. These metrics include the 7-day average of positive COVID-19 test rates, the 3-day average of COVID-19 patients in hospitals, the number of hospitals using surge capacity, and the 3-day average of COVID-19 related deaths.
How can we track these metrics?

The SARS-CoV-2 virus is not a Category A infectious substance. Waste contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 should be treated routinely as regulated medical waste. There is no evidence to suggest that facility waste needs any additional disinfection. If your contract waste company is applying stricter criteria, the facility should address the issue directly with the contractor.

Management of laundry, food service utensils and medical waste should also be performed in accordance with routine procedures.
Use personal protective equipment, such as puncture-resistant gloves and face or eye protection to prevent worker exposure to medical waste, including sharps and other items that can cause injuries or exposures to infectious materials.

While the transmissibility of COVID-19 is not fully understood, gowns are available that protect against microorganisms. The choice of gown should be made based on the level of risk of contamination. Certain areas of surgical and isolation gowns are defined as “critical zones” where direct contact with blood, body fluids, and/or other potentially infectious materials is most likely to occur. (ANSI/AAMI PB70pdf iconexternal icon).
If there is a medium to high risk of contamination and need for a large critical zone, isolation gowns that claim moderate to high barrier protection (ANSI/AAMI PB70 Level 3 or 4pdf iconexternal icon) can be used.
For healthcare activities with low, medium, or high risk of contamination, surgical gowns (ANSI/AAMI PB70 Levels 1-4pdf iconexternal icon), can be used. These gowns are intended to be worn by healthcare personnel during surgical procedures.
If the risk of bodily fluid exposure is low or minimal, gowns that claim minimal or low levels of barrier protection (ANSI/AAMI PB70 Level 1 or 2pdf iconexternal icon) can be used. These gowns should not be worn during surgical or invasive procedures, or for medium to high risk contamination patient care activities. <SEP> What types of gowns are available for healthcare personnel to protect from COVID-19? <EOS>

On May 26, 2020, Governor Northam signed Executive Order 63. This order requires all employees of essential retail businesses to wear face coverings when working in customer-facing areas. The order also requires all patrons aged 10 and over to cover their nose and mouth while inside personal care and personal grooming businesses, brick and mortar retail businesses, food and beverage establishments, entertainment or recreation businesses, train stations, bus stations, intrastate public transportation, any other indoor place shared by groups of people who are in close proximity to each other (excluding places of residence), and state and local government buildings when accessed for the purpose of securing public services (excluding students in daycare centers or participating in in-person classes in K-12 education or institutions of higher education). This order provides exceptions for persons eating or drinking, persons exercising or using exercise equipment, any person who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the face covering without assistance, any person seeking to communicate with the hearing impaired and for which the mouth needs to be visible, when temporary removal of the face covering is necessary to secure government or medical services, and persons with health conditions that prohibit wearing a face covering. The restrictions in Executive Order 63 began at 12:00 AM, Friday, May 29, 2020 and shall remain in force until amended or rescinded.
On June 30, 2020, Governor Northam signed Executive Order 67, which outlines business restrictions during Phase 3. These restrictions are intended to reduce the risk of COVID-19 exposure. The restrictions in Order 67 began at 12:00 AM, Wednesday, July 1, 2020 and shall remain in force until amended or rescinded.
Furthermore, on July 15th, 2020, Governor Ralph Northam announced the adoption of an emergency temporary standard for workplaces across the Commonwealth to prevent workplace exposure to COVID-19, including standards related to personal protective equipment, sanitation, social distancing, infectious disease preparedness and response plans, record keeping, training, and hazard communications.

Employers, workers, and their organizations should collaborate with health authorities to prevent and control COVID-19. Cooperation between management and workers and their representatives is essential for workplace‐related prevention measures. International labour standards on the rights and responsibilities of workers and employers in occupational safety and health should be fully respected. Employers, in consultation with workers and their representatives, should plan and implement measures to prevent and mitigate COVID-19 at the workplace through engineering and administrative controls, and provide personal protective equipment and clothing according to the risk assessment. Such measures should not involve any expenditure on the part of the workers.Special measures are needed to protect workers at higher risk of developing severe disease, such as those age 60 and over, or with underlying medical conditions, upon recommendation of the occupational health services. Workers in the informal economy and digital labour platforms, those in small enterprises, domestic and migrant workers should not be left behind in the protection of their health and safety at work and their livelihood.   There should be no social stigma or discrimination at the workplace for any reason, including access to information and protection from COVID-19, occupational health services and mental health and psychosocial support. If COVID-19 is contracted through occupational exposure, it could be considered an occupational disease and, if so determined, should be reported and compensated according to the international labour standards and the national schemes for employment injury benefits. <SEP> What are the rights, duties and responsibilities of employers? <EOS>
Yes. Children can catch the virus which causes COVID-19. However, children are no more likely to get COVID-19 than adults, and when they do catch it, they typically have mild symptoms, and many have no symptoms at all.
It is not clear whether children are less likely to catch the virus. Since they often have milder symptoms than adults, it may be that their cases are just less likely to be detected. Data from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported fewer infections in teenagers and children than in older people. This same pattern was seen during the 2002-2003 outbreaks of SARS coronavirus, a virus that is closely related to the COVID-19 virus.

 The vast majority of people recover from this infection. Most people will have mild or moderate symptoms. Some people may be advised to recover at home and isolate themselves from others. These individuals should call their physicians or healthcare practitioners if their symptoms get worse. Some COVID-19 infections can lead to serious illness, and in some cases, death. If someone has a more serious illness from COVID-19, they may be admitted to the hospital. Older people and those with pre-existing medical conditions have a greater risk for serious illness. Examples of pre-existing medical conditions are: heart disease, diabetes, lung disease, HIV, any condition that affects the immune system, persons with body mass index over 40, persons with liver disease. Persons who live in long term care are also at greater risk for serious illness due to age and preexisting medical conditions. <SEP>  If someone has COVID-19, what will happen to them? <EOS>

“To date, there is no evidence that very high vitamin D levels are protective against COVID-19 and consequently medical guidance is that people should not be supplementing their vitamin D levels beyond those which are currently recommended by published medical advice,” wrote Robin May, director of the Institute of Microbiology and Infection at the University of Birmingham in the UK. 
Vitamin D is important for healthy muscles, strong bones and a powerful immune system. The recommended daily dose of vitamin D for anyone over age 1 is 15 mcg/600 IU per day in the US. For anyone over 70 years of age in the US, the recommended daily intake goes up to 20 mcg/800 IU per day.

Through September 30, 2020, charging salaries to NIH grants when no work is being performed is allowable if your organization’s policy allows for the charging of salaries and benefits to currently active awards (under unexpected or extraordinary circumstances) from all funding sources, Federal and non-Federal. Recipient institutions should consult with their Human Resources Department to determine whether there are internal policies in place allowing employees to take paid leave, and to charge the grant, regardless of the source of funds, e.g. emergency or disruptive event policies. If the institution has a policy in place, and anticipates a need to charge personnel costs, notify the funding IC. NIH will request documentation to confirm the requirements of the institutional policy, and the effects of COVID-19 on the grant.
Recipients must exhaust other available funding sources to sustain its workforce and implement necessary steps to save overall operational costs (such as rent renegotiations) during this pandemic period in order to preserve Federal funds for grant supported activities. Recipients must retain documentation of their efforts to exhaust other funding sources and reduce overall operational costs. <SEP> 4.

The two general types of COVID-19 tests include an “active infection” test (a PCR test) to look for presence of the virus that causes COVID-19, or an “immune response” test (an antibody test) to look for evidence of previous infection.
Different types of PCR tests include a deep nasal swab, a shallow nasal swab that swabs only at the front of the nostrils, a throat swab, or a swab that captures saliva (used at community-based tests). There are also PCR tests such as the LabCorp pixel test that can be performed by yourself at home. For many people, including those without health insurance, the test may come with no upfront cost. The test is a painless swab of the front of the nose that is mailed to LabCorp, and results are received electronically. More information is available here: https://www.pixel.labcorp.com/at-home-test-kits/covid-19-test.
Antibody tests can be performed with a finger stick or via a tube of blood drawn by a qualified healthcare provider. Antibody tests for COVID-19 are available through healthcare providers and laboratories. Check with your healthcare provider to see if they offer antibody tests and whether you should get one. <SEP> What are the different types of tests? <EOS>

Increasing evidence suggests that a lost sense of smell, known medically as anosmia, may be a symptom of COVID-19. This is not surprising, because viral infections are a leading cause of loss of sense of smell, and COVID-19 is a caused by a virus. Still, loss of smell might help doctors identify people who do not have other symptoms, but who might be infected with the COVID-19 virus — and who might be unwittingly infecting others.A statement written by a group of ear, nose and throat specialists (otolaryngologists) in the United Kingdom reported that in Germany, two out of three confirmed COVID-19 cases had a loss of sense of smell; in South Korea, 30% of people with mild symptoms who tested positive for COVID-19 reported anosmia as their main symptom.On March 22nd, the American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery recommended that anosmia be added to the list of COVID-19 symptoms used to screen people for possible testing or self-isolation.In addition to COVID-19, loss of smell can also result from allergies as well as other viruses, including rhinoviruses that cause the common cold. So anosmia alone does not mean you have COVID-19. Studies are being done to get more definitive answers about how common anosmia is in people with COVID-19, at what point after infection loss of smell occurs, and how to distinguish loss of smell caused by COVID-19 from loss of smell caused by allergies, other viruses, or other causes altogether.Until we know more, tell your doctor right away if you find yourself newly unable to smell. He or she may prompt you to get tested and to self-isolate. <SEP> Is a lost sense of smell a symptom of COVID-19? What should I do if I lose my sense of smell? <EOS>

In April, a dog in North Carolina tested positive for the coronavirus, as did two pet cats in New York and eight tigers at the Bronx Zoo. However, there has been no evidence that pets such as dogs or cats can spread the coronavirus, according to the World Health Organization and the C.D.C. (The animals showed mostly mild symptoms — though a tiger was “visibly sick” — and have recovered.)
Still, if you are sick with the coronavirus, it is best not to pet your family dog. And avoid petting other people’s dogs as well. 
But do take care of your animal’s mental health — this is stressful for them, too. Staying at home for months on end can acclimate your dog to an unrealistic reality, experts said. Start leaving for a bit, even to walk, so they get used to the idea that you won’t always be around.

Yes. Wearing a cloth face covering is just a part of your overall protection plan to keep you and others from spreading and getting COVID-19. That plan includes:

Social distancing, or staying at least 6 feet away from other people
Frequent hand washing with soap and water for 20 seconds
Not touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands
Avoiding close contact with people who are sick
Staying home when you are sick
Covering your coughs and sneezes with a tissue
Disinfecting high-touch surfaces often, such as buttons, handles, and knobs

Wearing cloth face coverings is an additional public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19, not the only measure. <SEP> Do I still need to stay at least 6 feet away from people if wearing a cloth face covering? <EOS>

Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses that can infect both animals and humans, causing respiratory ailments as mild as the common cold and as severe as pneumonia. Rarely, animal coronaviruses infect humans and then spread among them.

Another prominent, more recent coronavirus strain called MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) emerged in the Middle East in 2012, and scientists say initially moved from a camel to human. <SEP> What are coronaviruses? <EOS>
The county health department should be actively engaged in your city’s response and helping to brief citizens. If the health department is not, you should raise targeted questions about important issues like the county’s plan for testing, contract tracing, isolation, and quarantine. However, I would encourage striking a constructive tone. It's not just, ''Are you doing these things?'' but, ''How can I help you do these things?'' The amount of contact-tracing and support for isolation that will be necessary far exceeds what any jurisdiction or local public health department can do. One of the most important roles for mayors is to mobilize the business community (especially hotels) and universities. Offer and solicit help from all quarters.

 Each OTP should develop a business continuity plan that is inclusive of the recommendations from ADHS, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA). Should there be a disruption to services, notification should be made to AHCCCS and the Health Plans with which the provider is contracted, or to AHCCCS and the FFS Program(s) with which the member is enrolled, to ensure coordination of care efforts are implemented and access to care is not compromised. Providers should reference and utilize SAMHSA's TAP 34: Disaster Planning Handbook in the development of their plans. Providers should also work with Health Plan and FFS Program Emergency Response Coordinators for additional support. Please see SOTA OTP guidance memo on strategies for OTP Emergency Preparedness; Prevention and Education; Dosing for Take-Homes; Clinic Hours and Self-Administered Medication. <SEP>  What is the expectation for coordination and continuity for Opioid Treatment Program (OTP) providers specific to Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) in the event that an OTP clinic or OTP network becomes compromised? <EOS>
The Secretary of Defense directs that all individuals on Department of Defense property, installations, and facilities will wear cloth face coverings when they cannot maintain six feet of social distance in public areas or work centers. This guidance applies to all service members, DOD civilians, contractors, families (apart from residences on installations) and all other individuals on DOD property.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain, especially in areas of significant community-based transmission. They should not be worn by children under age 2 or anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, or unable to remove the mask without assistance.
CDC also advises the use of simple cloth face coverings to slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others. Cloth face coverings fashioned from household items or made at home from common materials at low cost can be used as an additional, voluntary public health measure.
If you want information on face coverings and how to make them visit these CDC sites:

Instructions for DIY/homemade cloth face covers and proper wear:
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html


The cloth face coverings recommended are not surgical masks or N-95 respirators.  Those are critical supplies that must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.

CDC knows that wearing cloth face coverings may not be possible in every situation or for some people. In some situations, wearing a cloth face covering may worsen a physical or mental health condition, lead to a medical emergency, or introduce significant safety concerns. For example,

If you are deaf or hard of hearing—or if you care for or interact with a person who is hearing impaired—you have problems if you rely on lipreading to communicate. In this case, consider asking others to use a clear face covering. If that’s not possible, ask them to consider using written communication, closed captioning, or decreasing background noise while wearing a cloth face covering that blocks your lips.
Some people with developmental disabilities, sensory integration concerns or tactile sensitivities, certain mental health conditions, or limited cognitive ability may have a negative reaction to wearing a cloth face covering. They should consult with their healthcare provider as part of the decision to wear a cloth face covering.
Younger children (e.g., preschool or early elementary aged) may be unable to wear a cloth face covering properly, especially for a long period. Have your children wear cloth face coverings when it’s hard to maintain a distance of 6 feet from others (e.g., during carpool drop off or pick up, or when standing in line at school). Ensure your child’s face covering is the right size and fit. Teach and remind your children about how important it is to wear face coverings. Make sure they wear the covering correctly. 
Don’t wear cloth face coverings while in activities that may cause the cloth face covering to become wet, like when swimming at the beach or pool. A wet cloth face covering may make it difficult to breathe. For these activities like swimming, it is important to maintain physical distance from others when in the water.
If you do high intensity activities, like running, wearing a cloth face covering may make it difficult to breathe. If you need to you should consider doing the activity where there is greater air circulation and air exchange (for instance, outdoors versus indoors). You need to maintain a safe physical distance from others.
If you work in a place where cloth face coverings may increase your risk of heat-related illness or cause safety concerns (e.g., straps getting caught in machinery), check with an occupational safety and health professional to find out what is the best face covering for your work. Outdoor workers may use of cloth face coverings when in close contact with other people, like during group travel or shift meetings. They may remove the covering when social distancing is possible.

If residents have filed taxes in 2018 or 2019, or they did not file taxes but receive Social Security payments, the IRS will automatically send stimulus payments to individuals and families. Individuals that have previously paid or received tax reimbursements with direct deposits should receive their money by mid-April. If the IRS doesn't have your bank information, it will send a paper check to your last known address. Those checks will be sent out starting at the end of April through early September.
However, the Tax Policy Center at the Brookings Institution estimates that there are as many as 10 million low-income, childless adults in the United States who are eligible for the federal government's stimulus payment program, but are at risk of missing out on the money because they have not filed taxes and do not participate in Social Security programs.
If you don't file taxes or get Social Security, the IRS and TurboTax have created an online portal to submit information on their direct-deposit details or mailing address and choose how they want to receive their stimulus check. Cities can utilize the infrastructure they have as part of their free tax prep programs or set up a virtual service that does outreach to low-income residents to ensure they have either filed in the past two years or registered with the IRS to receive payments.
Cities can also build people awareness about the stimulus payment scamming. The IRS has issued guidelines to help individuals discern what engagement is real.

There is no evidence that getting the vaccination against influenza will help against COVID-19. They are different viruses and the antibodies that protect us from one virus do not protect us against the other. You could, however, be infected with both viruses at the same time, and getting the vaccination against influenza will reduce your likelihood of getting the flu and being sick from two viruses at the same time.
Similarly, vaccines such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus. The term pneumonia means any lung inflammation caused by a bacterial or viral infection.
Although these vaccines are not effective against COVID-19, vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health.

National and international organizations are working on models to estimate the number of people who will get sick, but the situation is changing rapidly. It is possible that models will underestimate the number of sick individuals because those with mild symptoms will not seek medical attention, and researchers use different methods to attempt to account for that.
In February, scenarios from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention projected that between 160 million and 214 million people in the US could be infected over the course of the epidemic, and that as many as 200,000 to 1.7 million people could ultimately die. And, the calculations based on the CDC's scenarios suggested, 2.4 million to 21 million people in the US could require hospitalization, which would overburden our medical system.
However, the CDC's projected numbers did not account for steps that are being taken to slow COVID-19 spread, which is why it is critical that everyone begin intensive social distancing immediately - as much as possible, limit contact with people outside your family.

In most cases tuberculosis (TB) treatment is not different in people with or without COVID-19 infection. Experience on joint management of both COVID-19 infection and TB remains limited. However, suspension of TB treatment in COVID-19 patients should be exceptional. TB preventive treatment, treatment for drug-susceptible or drug-resistant TB disease should continue uninterrupted to safeguard the patient’s health, reduce transmission and prevent the development of drug-resistance. While treatment trials are ongoing, no medication is currently recommended for COVID-19 and therefore no cautions on drug-drug interactions are indicated at present. TB patients on treatment should nonetheless be asked if they are taking any medicines, including traditional cures, that may interact with their medication.Effective treatments to prevent TB and to treat active TB have been scaled up and are in use worldwide. The risk of death in TB patients approaches 50% if left untreated and may be higher in the elderly or in the presence of comorbidity. It is critical that TB services are not disrupted during the COVID-19 response.  Gathering evidence as this pandemic unfolds will be very important, while upholding the norms of professional conduct and patient confidentiality when handling clinical details. <SEP> Is tuberculosis treatment different in people who have both TB and COVID-19? <EOS>
There is no scientific proof or evidence that wearing a disposable mask or cloth face covering can hurt your immune system.   Face coverings help limit the amount of respiratory droplets that go into the air to help stop the spread of COVID-19.  Doctors, nurses and other medical staff have been wearing face masks for decades.  Disposable masks should be thrown away if they become wet or dirty, and only used one time.   Cloth face coverings should be washed.  See Cloth Face Covers for more information. <SEP> Does wearing a disposable mask or cloth face covering weaken the immune system? <EOS>
 Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats and bats.  Early on, many of the patients at the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in China had some link to a large seafood and live animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread.  Later, a growing number of patients reportedly did not have exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread.

SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in blood and stool specimens, and SARS-CoV-2 virus has been isolated in cell culture from the stool of some patients, including a patient with pneumonia 15 days after symptom onset. The duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in upper and lower respiratory tract specimens and in extrapulmonary specimens is not yet known but may be several weeks or longer. Duration of several weeks or longer has been observed in cases of MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV infection. While viable, infectious SARS-CoV has been isolated from respiratory, blood, urine, and stool specimens, viable, infectious MERS-CoV has only been isolated from respiratory tract specimens. It is not yet known whether other non-respiratory body fluids from an infected person including blood, vomit, urine, breast milk, or semen can contain viable, infectious SARS-CoV-2. <SEP> Which body fluids can spread infection? <EOS>
Transit riders should wear masks unless there is a medical reason that prevents them from wearing a mask, or unless they are unable to provide themselves with a mask or a suitable option (bandana, scarf, etc.) because of economic reasons.

Whether a child should go to school depends on their health condition, the current transmission of COVID-19 within their community, and the protective measures the school and community have in place to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. While current evidence suggests that the risk of severe disease for children is lower overall than for adults, special precautions can be taken to minimize the risk of infection among children, and the benefits of returning to school should also be considered. Current evidence suggests that people with underlying conditions such as chronic respiratory illness, obesity, diabetes or cancer are at higher risk of developing severe disease and death than people without other health conditions. This also appears to be the case for children, but more information is still needed. <SEP> Should children with underlying health conditions (asthma, diabetes, obesity) return to school? <EOS>
The Virginia Department of Health (VDH) continues to work closely with local, state and federal government partners, community partners, first responders, healthcare providers, and emergency management partners, to respond to this public health threat.
VDH is also working with state and local health departments, health care systems, businesses, schools, colleges and universities, and the general public to reduce widespread transmission of COVID-19.
When illness is reported to VDH, our health experts investigate. VDH assists with testing for COVID-19 through our state public health lab and private laboratories. If a case of illness is identified, VDH also works to identify those who have had close contact with the patient and monitor their health closely. <SEP> How is VDH responding to COVID-19? <EOS>
Small-business owners are struggling. Some are giving up or adapting to the point of being almost unrecognizable. Some owners have learned from the 2008 recession, but they’re still struggling. 
The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program.
But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don’t know how to use.

On August 3, 2020, the Protecting Nonprofits from Catastrophic Cash Flow Strain Act was enacted into law. This Act amends the CARES Act and now allows for reimbursable employers that are eligible to receive reimbursement to only pay 50% of the amount due on eligible benefit charges. Previously the CARES Act required that 100% of the benefit charges for the billing period be paid before the 50% reimbursement could be applied. 
The Department will post the reimbursement to the billing period once the funding for that billing period has been received from the US Treasury. The reimbursement amount will be reflected as a payment/credit on your account and will be applied to the appropriate billing period. If an over-payment exists after the 50% reimbursement is applied, a credit will be created that may be used to pay future benefit charge amounts due. <SEP> ​The CARES Act provides for state and local governmental entities, certain nonprofit organizations, and Federally recognized Indian tribes that make payments in lieu of contributions to their state’s unemployment fund to be reimbursed at 50 percent for payments made on benefit claims from March 13, 2020 to December 31, 2020.  When will Pennsylvania begin issuing those reimbursements? <EOS>

It’s difficult to track how far the virus spreads via asymptomatic people, especially since they show no signs of symptoms.  With this in mind, try to follow basic precautions, like social distancing, wearing a face covering when you go out and about, disinfecting commonly used surfaces, washing your hands frequently, and covering your coughs and sneezes. <SEP> How do you track the asymptomatic spread of COVID-19? <EOS>
The key measures to protect incarcerated persons, staff and the community are to take all steps possible to prevent the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into facilities, to identify early and isolate COVID-19 cases, and to implement appropriate infection prevention recommendations to prevent further spread in the facility and the community.
The Virginia Department of Corrections and Virginia’s local and regional jails have taken proactive steps to reduce opportunities for introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into facilities, including cancelling in-person visitation, reducing transfers and intakes if at all possible, applying social distancing measures in all possible parts of facilities, providing hand hygiene supplies, and educating and preparing staff and incarcerated persons for COVID-19 response. These facilities are working actively with state and local health department partners. <SEP> What measures can be taken to prevent COVID-19 cases in correctional facilities, detention centers, etc.? <EOS>
As much as possible, reduce sources of stress: Maintain contact with and seek support from family and friends via phone, email, text, etc. Try to maintain daily routines and make time for physical activity and sleep. Use relaxation exercises (e.g. slow breathing, meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, grounding exercises – see WHO Clinical handbook p.70) to relieve stressful thoughts and feelings. Engage in activities that in the past have helped with managing adversity. Seek information about COVID- 19 from reliable sources and reduce the time spent consuming news (for example, 1-2 times per day, rather than every hour). Seek care from a trained health provider for symptoms and conditions including injuries that need medical attention. Due to restrictions on movement, and pressure on health systems, it may be difficult to access healthcare in person at this time. In this case, find out what is available in your locality and seek alternatives, including information and support offered by phone or online.  If you are currently receiving healthcare and support for violence-related issues this could continue during COVID-19 – this could even be by phone or online if feasible and appropriate for your health needs. <SEP> I am safe, but I am suffering from mental / sexual / social / long-term physical health problems because of violence.

 An asymptomatic individual may be suspected of COVID-19 by their health care provider for various reasons, such as known exposure or working in a high-risk environment. Such use is within the authorized indications for use of tests intended for individuals suspected of COVID-19 by their health care provider. For health care providers who are ordering an authorized SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test to be used off-label (outside the authorization) to screen asymptomatic individuals not suspected of having COVID-19, we recommend they consider the information below.
Although the current available literature suggests that symptomatic individuals with COVID-19 and asymptomatic individuals without known exposure may have similar levels of viral genetic material, there is limited data on the distribution of viral loads in individuals with and without symptoms across demographics, different settings, and specimen types. Therefore, when screening asymptomatic individuals, health care providers should consider using a highly sensitive test, especially if rapid turnaround times are available. If highly sensitive tests are not feasible, or if turnaround times are prolonged, health care providers may consider use of less sensitive point-of-care tests, even if they are not specifically authorized for this indication (commonly referred to as “off-label”).  For congregate care settings, like nursing homes or similar settings, repeated use of rapid point-of-care testing may be superior for overall infection control compared to less frequent, highly sensitive tests with prolonged turnaround times.
If less sensitive tests, such as some rapid point-of-care tests, are used, health care providers should be aware of the performance of the tests and may want to consider different testing approaches, such as serial testing. “Negative” results should be considered as “presumptive negative,” and health care providers should consider them in the context of clinical observations, patient history, and epidemiological information.  Thus, if there is a significant new outbreak in a congregate care facility or high clinical suspicion of an infection in an individual resident, a negative point-of-care test should be confirmed with a highly sensitive molecular test (refer to CDC guidelines).  It is not necessary to perform confirmatory high-sensitivity molecular tests on individuals with negative antigen test or other point-of-care test results if they are obtained during routine screening or surveillance.
Commercial manufacturers and laboratories submitting an EUA request to the FDA for tests to screen asymptomatic individuals should consider the validation recommendations outlined in the EUA templates for such use. <SEP>  Does the FDA have recommendations for health care providers using SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests for screening asymptomatic individuals for COVID-19?

That depends on where you want to go. 
In recent weeks, many countries around the world, including the United States, have imposed travel restrictions to help curb the spread of the coronavirus. Airport closures, the suspension of all incoming and outgoing flights, and nationwide lockdowns are just some of the measures countries are adopting in an effort to help contain the pandemic.
Even as many countries remain off-limits to American visitors because of the high rate of coronavirus within the United States, about two dozen others have started to welcome U.S. citizens.

As of present, no cities have required curbside pick-up at businesses that remain open. However, some restaurants and grocery stores have converted to curbside pick-up only or have a curbside pick-up option. For example, national consumer electronics chain, Best Buy, has switched to “contactless” curbside service, allowing only employees into its stores. Helping businesses figure out how they can continue to provide services while maintaining safety for employees and customers should be a local problem-solving priority (guided by the best available advice and evidence on a national level for what procedures are required for safety).

The COVID-19 death count shown on the Cases in the U.S. web page includes deaths reported daily by state, local, and territorial health departments. This count reflects the most up-to-date information received by CDC based on preliminary reporting from health departments.
In contrast, provisional COVID-19 death counts from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) are updated Monday through Friday with information collected from death certificates. These data represent the most accurate death counts. However, because it can take several weeks for death certificates to be submitted and processed, there is on average a delay of 1–2 weeks before they are reported. Therefore, the provisional death counts may not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period, especially for more recent periods. Death counts from earlier weeks are continually revised and may increase or decrease as new and updated death certificate data are received. Provisional COVID-19 death counts may therefore differ from those on other published sources, such as media reports or the Cases in the U.S. web page. <SEP> Why are the death counts for the Cases in the U.S. webpage different from the Provisional Death Counts for COVID-19 webpage? <EOS>

 As stated in Section IV.D of the FDA's Policy for Coronavirus Disease-2019 Tests, while laboratories are encouraged to submit EUA requests for serology tests, the FDA does not intend to object to the development and use of serology tests to identify antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 by laboratories that are certified under CLIA to perform high-complexity testing, where the test has been validated, notification is provided to the FDA, and information that helps users and patients understand the test results, such as the following, is included in the test reports:
This test has not been reviewed by the FDA.
Negative results do not preclude acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. If acute infection is suspected, direct testing for SARS-CoV-2 is necessary.
Results from antibody testing should not be used to diagnose or exclude acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Positive results may be due to past or present infection with non-SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus strains, such as coronavirus HKU1, NL63, OC43, or 229E.
This policy does not apply to at-home testing, including at-home specimen collection.
The laboratories that have notified the FDA that they have validated and intend to offer serology tests as set forth in Section IV.D of the FDA's Policy for Coronavirus Disease-2019 Tests are listed on this FAQ page under What laboratories are offering serology tests under the policy outlined in Section IV.D of the Policy for Coronavirus Disease-2019 Tests?. <SEP>  I am a clinical laboratory certified to perform high-complexity testing under CLIA.

 Yes, under an emergency use authorization. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is working diligently to mitigate any potential shortages in the supply chain and taking action to assure health care personnel on the front lines have sufficient supplies of respiratory protective devices. The FDA concluded, based on the totality of scientific evidence available, that certain imported respirators that are not National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-approved are appropriate to protect the public health or safety.On March 24, 2020, the FDA issued an, Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), for importing non-NIOSH-approved N95 respirators. Under this EUA, among other criteria, the FDA accepted standards from Australia, Brazil, Europe, Japan, Korea, and Mexico who have similar standards to NIOSH. The FDA did not list KN95 respirators in this EUA because of concerns about fraudulent products listed as KN95s., , On June 6, 2020, the FDA reissued the two EUAs covering imported respirators by tightening criteria in the, Non-NIOSH-Approved Disposable Filtering Facepiece Respirators Manufactured in China, as well as in the, Imported, Non-NIOSH-Approved Disposable Filtering Facepiece Respirators, to not only include new language related to decontamination as noted above, but also to revise the Scope of Authorization with respect to which jurisdictions are included in the criteria for eligibility in both EUAs, among other revisions., On April 3, 2020, in response to continued respirator shortages, the FDA issued a new, EUA, for non-NIOSH-approved N95 respirators made in China, which makes KN95 respirators eligible for authorization if certain criteria are met, including evidence demonstrating that the respirator meets certain standards., , On May 7, 2020, the FDA revised and reissued the April 3, 2020 EUA based in part on concerns raised about the performance of certain respirators authorized under the third criterion of the April 3, 2020 EUA. For example, data from NIOSH testing on some respirators that were listed in, Appendix A, showed that some respirators failed to meet the expected filtration performance efficiency., , On June 6, 2020, the FDA reissued the, Non-NIOSH-Approved Disposable Filtering Facepiece Respirators Manufactured in China, by revising the Scope of Authorization such that authorized respirators listed in, Appendix A, will no longer be authorized if decontaminated. The FDA also reissued multiple decontamination system EUAs, such that, among other things, they are no longer authorized to decontaminate respirators manufactured in China, where applicable., The FDA also issued guidance outlining a policy to help expand the availability of general use face masks during this pandemic. Face masks may also be authorized for use as source control (for example, not as PPE) under the Face Mask umbrella EUA if certain criteria are met.The FDA has adjusted its import screening to further expedite imports of legitimate products and is continually monitoring its import systems to prevent and mitigate any potential issues. The FDA established a special email inbox, COVID19FDAIMPORTINQUIRIES@fda.hhs.gov, for industry representatives to quickly communicate with the agency and address questions or concerns. The FDA is ready and available to engage with importers to minimize disruptions during the importing process. <SEP>  Can respirators approved under standards used in other countries, such as KN95, be used in the U.S. during the COVID-19 pandemic? <EOS>
Each member of the community plays an important role in preventing the community spread of COVID-19 by following these precautions:

Avoid contact with sick people.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Clean your hands often by washing them with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60%–95% alcohol. Soap and water should be used if hands are visibly dirty. Do not use any hand sanitizer that is methanol based.  More information about methanol based hand sanitizers can be found here.
It is especially important to clean hands after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after coughing, sneezing or blowing your nose.
If you are sick, stay home and rest, even if illness is mild.
Practice social distancing, staying at least 6 feet from others if you have to go out.
Avoid in-person gatherings of 10 or more people. For parts of the state that have entered Phase II, gatherings of up to 50 people are permitted, but social distancing should be maintained. For parts of the state that have entered Phase III, gatherings of up to 250 people are permitted, but social distancing should be maintained.
Older adults and those with other risk factors are recommended to stay home if possible
Wear a cloth face covering when you are in public, particularly in locations where it’s difficult to practice social distancing (e.g., grocery store, pharmacy, etc.)

It is very important that people with even mild signs of illness (fever, cough, chills, muscle pain, sore throat, or new loss of taste or smell) stay home to prevent spreading illness to others! <SEP> How can my community prevent COVID-19 spread? <EOS>

No. Do not delay immunizations, particularly in babies and children under 2. There’s a very specific schedule for when babies and children should receive certain vaccines. That schedule is timed with the risk that a child could get a specific disease. 
For example, there’s an illness called pertussis (whooping cough) that can be devastating for younger babies. So we start that vaccine at 2 months, and then we give it again at 4 months and 6 months. Giving immunizations early is really important to protect your child. Many vaccines take time to work, and children need multiple doses before they can be immune.  
Children rarely become sick with the novel coronavirus. Vaccine-preventable illnesses pose a much higher risk to a child’s health than the novel coronavirus <SEP> Is it OK to postpone my child’s vaccines until after the crisis? <EOS>
Ask residents to actively monitor (at least daily) for COVID-19 symptoms, including fever and respiratory symptoms (shortness of breath, new or change in cough). Administrators should work with local health authorities to establish procedures for those who become sick. Sick residents should avoid contact with individuals who are healthy.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and OSHA are providing extensive guidance for infection prevention in healthcare  settings. OSHA's guidance materials include:

The Healthcare section of the COVID-19 Safety and Health Topics page
The high and very high exposure risk sections of  the Guidance for Preparing Workplaces for COVID-19 booklet (Spanish)

Both agencies' guidance materials describe how healthcare employers should develop and implement infection  control and preparedness plans and communicate those plans to workers through effective  training. Employers should assess the risks and follow the hierarchy of controls for worker protection:

Engineering controls (e.g., airborne infection isolation rooms);
Administrative controls (e.g., cohorting patients);
Work practices (e.g., handwashing, disinfecting surfaces); and
Appropriate personal protective equipment (e.g., gloves, respirators, face  shields or other eye protection, and gowns).

No. The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults. COVID-19 can look different in different people. For many people, being sick with COVID-19 would be a little bit like having the flu. People can get a fever, cough, or have a hard time taking deep breaths. Most people who have gotten COVID-19 have not gotten very sick. Only a small group of people who get it have had more serious problems.

A funeral or visitation service can be held for a person who has died of COVID-19. Funeral home workers should follow their routine infection prevention and control precautions when handling a decedent who died of COVID-19. If it is necessary to transfer a body to a bag, follow Standard Precautions, including additional personal protective equipment (PPE) if splashing of fluids is expected. Given the varying weights of decedents and variety, construction, and conditions of body bag materials, postmortem care workers should use prudent judgement determining if risks for puncture, tearing, or failure of body bags could occur and whether a second body bag or a body bag of thicker, stronger material (e.g. minimum of 6 mil thickness) is necessary. Risk factors can be found listed here on the CDC Postmortem Guidance under the heading “Cleaning and Waste Disposal Recommendations".  For transporting a body after the body has been bagged, disinfect the outside of the bag with a product that is EPA-approved against SARS-CoV-2. Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claims are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application method and contact time, etc.). Wear disposable nitrile gloves when handling the body bag.
Embalming can be conducted. During embalming, follow Standard Precautions including the use of additional PPE if splashing is expected (e.g. disposable gown, face shield or goggles and facemask). Wear appropriate respiratory protection if any procedures will generate aerosols or if required for chemicals used in accordance with the manufacturer’s label. Wear heavy-duty gloves over nitrile disposable gloves if there is a risk of cuts, puncture wounds, or other injuries that break the skin. Additional information on how to safely conduct aerosol-generating procedures is in the CDC’s Postmortem Guidance. Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions. Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claims are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application method and contact time, etc.).
After an autopsy of a decedent with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, the following recommendations apply for the autopsy room (and anteroom if applicable):

Keep ventilation systems active while cleaning is conducted; before cleaning, wait 24 hours in a non-healthcare setting, or if you know the air changes per hour of the room or area in a healthcare setting, follow the recommended wait time before cleaning.
Wear disposable gloves recommended by the manufacturer of the cleaner or disinfectant while cleaning and when handling cleaning or disinfecting solutions.
Dispose of gloves if they become damaged or soiled and when cleaning is completed, as described below. Never wash or reuse gloves.
Use eye protection, such as a face shield or goggles, if splashing of water, cleaner/disinfectant, or other fluids, is expected.
Wear a clean, long-sleeved fluid-resistant gown to protect skin and clothing.
Wear a NIOSH-approved disposable N95 or higher respirator if you need to clean the room or area in less than 24 hours or the recommended wait time cannot be met.
Additional PPE may be required to protect workers against potential hazards associated with the cleaning and disinfectant products used and in accordance with the label instructions.
If PPE is in low supply, and cleaning must occur before the recommended wait time has passed, consider having workers who performed autopsies conduct the cleaning and sanitizing of the area.
When respirators are necessary to protect workers, employers must implement a comprehensive respiratory protection program in accordance with the OSHA Respiratory Protection standard (29 CFR 1910.134) that includes medical exams, fit-testing, and training.
Ensure workers are trained on OSHA’s Hazard Communication standard, 29 CFR 1910.1200, to communicate with workers about the hazardous chemicals used in the workplace.
Use Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-approved disinfectants that meet the criteria for use against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application method, contact time).
Clean the surface first, and then apply the disinfectant as instructed on the disinfectant manufacturer’s label. Ensure adequate contact time for effective disinfection.
Adhere to any safety precautions or other label recommendations as directed (e.g., allowing adequate ventilation in confined areas and proper disposal of unused product or used containers).
Avoid using product application methods that cause splashing or generate aerosols.
Cleaning activities should be supervised and inspected periodically to ensure correct procedures are followed.
Do not use compressed air and/or water under pressure for cleaning, or any other methods that can cause splashing or might re-aerosolize infectious material.
Gross contamination and liquids should be collected with absorbent materials, such as towels, by staff conducting the autopsy wearing designated PPE. Gross contamination and liquids should then be disposed of as described below:
Use of tongs and other utensils can minimize the need for personal contact with soiled absorbent materials.
Large areas contaminated with body fluids should be treated with disinfectant following removal of the fluid with absorbent material. The area should then be cleaned and given a final disinfection.
Small amounts of liquid waste (e.g., body fluids) can be flushed or washed down ordinary sanitary drains without special procedures.
Hard, nonporous surfaces may then be cleaned and disinfected as described above.
Follow standard operating procedures for the containment and disposal of used PPE and regulated medical waste. State and local governments should be consulted for appropriate disposal decisions.
Dispose of human tissues according to routine procedures for pathological waste.
Clean and disinfect or autoclave non-disposable instruments using routine procedures, taking appropriate precautions with sharp objects.
Materials or clothing that will be laundered can be removed from the autopsy suite (or anteroom, if applicable) in a sturdy, leak-proof biohazard bag that is tied shut and not reopened. These materials should then be sent for laundering according to routine procedures.
Wash reusable, non-launderable items (e.g., aprons) with a detergent solution on the warmest setting possible, rinse with water, decontaminate using disinfectant, and allow items to dry completely before next use.
Keep camera, telephones, computer keyboards, and other items that remain in the autopsy suite (or anteroom, if applicable) as clean as possible, but treat as if they are contaminated and handle with gloves. Wipe the items after use with appropriate Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-approved disinfectants that meet the criteria for use against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. If being removed from the autopsy suite, ensure decontamination to the extent possible with appropriate disinfectant according to the manufacturer’s recommendations prior to removal and reuse.

When cleaning is complete and PPE has been removed, wash hands immediately with soap and water for 20 seconds. If hands are not visibly dirty and soap and water are not available, an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol may be used. However, if hands are visibly dirty, always wash hands with soap and water before using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Avoid touching the face with gloved or unwashed hands. Ensure that hand hygiene facilities are readily available at the point of use (e.g., at or adjacent to the PPE doffing area).

 Please refer to the Policy for Coronavirus Disease-2019 Tests.
The FDA encourages such laboratories developing diagnostic tests, whether using purchased components or making their own primers/probes, to consider the validation recommendations in the guidance as they seek to validate their tests. If you pursue an alternate approach, we recommend discussing plans with us early, through the pre-EUA program. Please contact us at CDRH-EUA-Templates@fda.hhs.gov.
As noted in the guidance, once your test is validated and you are ready to begin clinical testing, labs should notify the FDA at CDRH-EUA-Templates@fda.hhs.gov and provide the name of the lab, lab director, address, and contact person. In the guidance, we recommend that you confirm the first five positive and the first five negative samples with an EUA-authorized test and include in your test report a statement that the FDA review of the validation is pending.
As stated in the guidance, the FDA does not intend to object to the use of validated diagnostic tests for specimen testing for a reasonable period of time after validation while the laboratory is preparing an EUA request. The FDA believes 15 business days is a reasonable period of time to prepare an EUA submission for a diagnostic test that has already been validated. <SEP>  I am a clinical laboratory certified to perform high-complexity testing under CLIA and am interested in developing a SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test.

“Other Leave with Pay”, code 699 remains available for reasons indicated in past guidance; however, it is not intended to replace, or supplement, vacation. The manager should have a discussion with the employee to understand their rationale. If the reason is to extend the total time off by using “Other Leave with Pay” to supplement vacation, the request should not be granted for this purpose.
Managers should discuss a reasonable amount of vacation for the employees to take, based on the employees’ past usage of vacation leave over the summer and any vacation leave that may have been scheduled but modified after the onset of the pandemic. For example, if the employee has been on “Other Leave with Pay” for childcare reasons, the manager should determine with the employee the amount of vacation that the employee might reasonably have expected to take over the summer for childcare, based on past usage of vacation leave during the summer months and be prepared to discuss this with the employee. The manager should consider discussing how to approach this with their departmental labour relations representatives before speaking to the employee. The manager should discuss with their employees how they will use all their 2020–21 vacation leave during this fiscal year.
If operational needs and the applicable collective agreement, or applicable terms and conditions of employment, allow for it, an employee may use their vacation time in a flexible manner. Managers are encouraged to be sensitive to employees’ vacation requests and to make reasonable steps to accommodate them, where possible. <SEP> An employee is willing to take vacation over the summer but would like to combine it with use of “Other Leave with Pay”, code 699.

Yes.  Please continue to focus on your child’s immunization  just as you would for in person learning.  Immunization requirements have not been waived for the 20-21 school year . The Superintendent’s memo 132-20 (5/29/20) regarding health requirements for enrollment is included for your review and below is the link:
http://www.doe.virginia.gov/administrators/index.shtml
The Code of Virginia requires that children be adequately immunized (§ 22.1-271.2) before entering public kindergarten or elementary school. Other required immunizations include Human Papillomavirus (HPV) for girls entering sixth grade; and a Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis (Tdap) booster for entry into seventh grade.
These requirements have NOT been waived and families are encouraged to make appointments with their pediatrician or primary care provider now to avoid the "back to school rush". <SEP> My 7th grade student is choosing to do 100% virtual, do they need to have their Tdap completed before they can begin school? <EOS>
The only possible way to find out is to be tested for COVID-19. Common symptoms are respiratory issues, such as trouble breathing, a dry cough, and fever. If you believe you are suffering from the coronavirus, notify your a health professional and isolate yourself for 14 days. <SEP> If you're sick but you get better in a few days, does it mean you got infected with COVID-19 (or coronavirus)? <EOS>
When people infected with the COVID-19 virus breathe out, clear their throats, cough, sneeze, speak, or otherwise move air out through their nose or mouth, droplets of all different sizes, which can contain the virus, are ejected into the air. Many people infected with the COVID-19 virus – perhaps up to 25 percent – wouldn't even know they are ejecting virus-laden droplets, as they may not exhibit symptoms.
Droplets suspended in the air are called an aerosol. Droplets that are large can remain in the air for seconds to minutes before falling to the ground. Smaller droplets stay in the air longer – minutes to even hours. It is important to note, however, that unless you are physically near an infected person, or in an indoor space with inadequate ventilation, COVID-19 virus in the air is unlikely to be a risk, because it is not likely to be present at a high enough level in the air to cause an infection to those who are far away.
We should all be minimizing the amount of time we spend in any one place, especially if others are nearby. This limits the time a person is potentially exposed to the virus.
It is also very important to stay as far away from one another as possible, minimum 6 feet. The farther, the better. Some experts recommend staying at least 25 feet away from others, even when outdoors. And it's a good idea to avoid crowded indoor spaces.
The traditional definition of airborne transmission is that small droplets containing a pathogen remaining viable over long time periods travel long distances in the air and infect other people when the pathogen is breathed in. Measles and tuberculosis are examples of respiratory diseases that remain infectious in the air for long time periods. The measles virus can live for up to two hours in the air where an infected person coughs or sneezes. Tuberculosis can live in the air for up to six hours.
Under experimental conditions, researchers found that the COVID-19 virus stayed viable in the air for three hours. The researchers estimate that in most real-world situations, the virus would remain suspended in the air for about 30 minutes, before settling onto surfaces. This is similar to what was found for SARS and MERS, which some researchers consider likely to be spread via airborne transmission. One study estimates that a person infected with the COVID-19 virus who speaks loudly for one minute produces at least 1,000 virus-containing droplets that remain airborne for more than 8 minutes. Furthermore, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend airborne precautions for the care of COVID-19 suspected or confirmed patients.
Many unknowns remain about the COVID-19 virus, such as how many virus particles need to be breathed in for an infection to begin. However, it is likely that active COVID-19 virus travels through the air when ejected by infected people. By staying as far away from one another as possible, keeping on the move, avoiding touching our faces, frequently washing our hands well with soap and water, coughing or sneezing into the crook of our elbows, wearing cloth face coverings (masks), and staying home when sick, we can protect ourselves and others.

My personal opinion is that safe isolation should be offered as a voluntary option for all infected people. For example, people who don’t require hospitalization and who live with older adults or medically vulnerable people in close quarters, or homeless people, or others might best be cared for in hotels or dormitories. Infection control needs to be handled extremely well in any such location. Some countries in Asia require that all ill people go to isolation facilities, and some communities may wish to try this. My view is that making a facility attractive to patients and safe for all may be the best way to reduce the risk of spreading infection.

If you and your household are isolating because you are experiencing coronavirus symptoms, you and your household are able to end self-isolation early if you receive a negative test.
However, if you are isolating because you live with someone who has symptoms, you must continue to isolate for 14 days even if you receive a negative test. You may only end isolation early if the person with symptoms in your household receives a negative test.
If you are isolating because you have been contacted by NHS Test and Trace or because you are required to under public health measures at the border, you must continue to isolate for 14 days even if you receive a negative test. <SEP> 1.5 If I have had C19 symptoms, do I need to keep self-isolating if I have received a negative test result? <EOS>

As of July 6, youth day camps, including municipal summer programs, may operate so long as they comply with required social distancing and other mitigation policies.
Residential and overnight camps are prohibited from operating.
To help protect the health and safety of our children, camp workers, and communities against the spread of COVID-19, the Department of Health has released the following guidelines for youth summer camps which include:

Campers and staff must be screened for fever or signs of COVID-19 illness prior to being permitted to enter the facility or participating in camp programming. Persons that have a fever or other signs of illness should not be admitted to the camp.
Campers and staff members should be educated on steps to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
Groups should include the same children each day with the same staff person, if possible. Mixing between groups should be restricted. Camps should avoid communal dining and stagger mealtimes to ensure social distancing of groups. Surfaces should be cleaned and sanitized between each meal service.
Staff are encouraged to wear cloth masks while working unless (1) doing so would inhibit the individual's health, (2) the individual is in extreme heat outdoors, or (3) the individual is in water.
Cloth face coverings for staff and campers should be worn when social distancing of 6 feet between assigned groups cannot be maintained. Cloth face coverings should NOT be put on children under age two because of the danger of suffocation.
All youth camps are prohibited from off-site activities, engaging in full-contact sports and providing resident or overnight camp activities.
Handwash and hand sanitizers stations should be provided in numerous areas around the camp.
Common surfaces and rooms should be cleaned at least daily including restrooms and countertops.
Gloves should be worn when handling or serving food to campers.
Social distancing is encouraged during bussing/transportation to and from camp. Vehicles should be cleaned and disinfected between each use. Face coverings should be worn when social distancing can't be maintained.

For a full list of required safety policies, refer to Department of Health's Executive Directive 20-021.
To open, youth camps must submit application form at least 14 days prior to the start date of camp activities and attestation form at least 24 hours prior to opening. For these forms and detailed guidance on youth summer camp standards, refer to the Department of Health's Youth Camps page.
Swimming Pools
Summer camps may use their pools when they reopen, so long as they comply with required safety protocols.
Pools must follow the appropriate requirements from Executive Order No. 153, Executive Order No. 157, and the Department of Health's Executive Directive 20-022 and COVID-19 Pools and Aquatic Recreation Facility Standards, including developing and implementing a COVID-19 Pool Operation Prevention Plan that must be submitted to and approved by the local health authority.
Safety Grants for Youth Camps
Up to $20 million in grants is available to help child care centers and youth camps meet health and safety guidelines in response to COVID-19.
Youth camps can receive up to $2,000 to purchase additional cleaning products, personal protective equipment, and other products and services. The providers must be registered with the NJ Workforce Registry and must apply through the New Jersey Child Care Information System (NJCCIS).

 Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses, meaning they are one of the easiest types of viruses to kill with the appropriate disinfectant product. All FSIS-regulated establishments are required to have Sanitation Standard Operating Procedures (Sanitation SOP), which are written procedures that an establishment develops and implements to prevent direct contamination or adulteration of product. It is the establishment’s responsibility to implement the procedures as written in the Sanitation SOPs. The establishment must maintain daily records sufficient to document the implementation and monitoring of the Sanitation SOPs and any corrective action taken. FSIS verifies that regulated establishments adhere to the procedures in place. The same sanitary procedures that establishments are already following to protect food safety will also help prevent the spread of respiratory illnesses like COVID-19. <SEP>  How will FSIS-regulated establishments handle cleanup if cases have been identified at the facility? <EOS>
There is currently no scientific evidence to show that taking ibuprofen while sick with COVID-19 will lead to worsening illness.

Both acetaminophen and ibuprofen, like any other medication, can have serious side effects and healthcare providers should use their clinical judgement to determine the most appropriate treatment for their patient. <SEP> Is it safe to give ibuprofen to patients with COVID-19? <EOS>
Ventilation is an important factor in preventing the virus that causes COVID-19 from spreading. Recirculated air from split air conditioning units, fan coils or any system that runs with a recirculation mode should be avoided where possible, unless in a single occupancy room with no one else present. If recirculation is unavoidable, increase outdoor air exchange by opening windows, if possible and safe to do so, and minimize air blowing from one person directly at another. Floor or ceiling fans can provide ventilation when the people occupying the room are from the same household, but are not recommended when travelers from different households are together. <SEP> Is it safe to use fans or air conditioning in an accommodation? <EOS>
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends following good hygiene practices, including frequent hand washing, staying hydrated, coughing into one’s arm or a tissue, and staying home if you feel ill. In addition, even when you’re not ill, we advise you to stay at home unless you absolutely need to go out, and practice social distancing (staying at least six feet away from others). <SEP> How can people help prevent the spread of the disease? <EOS>
When infected with COVID-19, some people may exhibit no or minor symptoms, while others may become very sick, or even die. The severity of the virus ranges from person to person. Older people and people with preexisting health issues such as heart and lung disease have had a higher risk of developing more severe COVID-19 illnesses.
A large World Health Organization study of nearly 56,000 confirmed cases in China showed that about 80% of cases were mild to moderate, while 14% were severe and 6% were critical. Critical cases exhibited respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction/failure.
As of May 14th, around 6.8% of reported COVID-19 cases (globally) had died. The current mortality for known cases of COVID-19 is about 2.4% in South Korea and 4.5% in Germany, countries where there has been widespread testing. By comparison, seasonal flu generally kills about 0.1% of those infected on average.
Because many mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 infections go unreported, it is thought the case fatality ratio is lower than 2%, possibly about 1%; but that would still mean that COVID-19 is at least ten times more deadly than the flu, and very dangerous.

NIH understands the effect of closures on the progress of NIH-funded research. Recipients affected by COVID-19 should contact the funding IC to discuss the progress on the specific award and identify potential solutions.While Institutes and Centers plan, based on availability of funding, to issue administrative supplements when absolutely necessary, it is clear that for the vast majority of grantees, supplement requests in the next 2-3 months would be premature. We therefore recommend that institutions hold off on submitting COVID19-related administrative supplement requests until such time as (1) the full impacts of the pandemic on your research are clear, and (2) you have had the chance to discuss the various options with the relevant NIH staff and you have agreed that an administrative supplement is the best option for your project.There are two exceptions. The exceptions to this recommendation are for (1) supplements to existing projects that will allow investigators to immediately address scientific questions of direct relevance to the COVID19 epidemic, and (2) supplements that are needed to address immediate, mission critical needs over the next 3 months. Investigators who believe they meet these exceptions should raise these issues with their program officers or grants management specialists prior to submitting such requests. <SEP> 6.

The CDC recommends that employers take steps to ensure that workers are not too fatigued to work safely. One option is scheduling shorter shifts for physically and mentally demanding workloads. However, make sure that schedule or shift changes don’t have unintended safety risks for workers. For example, replacing fewer, longer shifts with shorter, more frequent shifts could put workers at greater risk if they then need to commute more frequently via public transportation. When considering shifts in schedules, consult with workers to be sure you are taking all potential effects on worker safety into account. (Dr. Caitlin Rivers, 5/19/20) <SEP> Would shorter shifts reduce risk for employees? <EOS>
Yes, but guests  must continue to practice physical distancing precautions, including remaining  at least 6 feet apart from others and wearing a face covering. This means you  should not hug, kiss, hold hands or otherwise touch others in attendance.

People with weakened immune systems or underlying health conditions should continue to follow their treatment plans, including continuing medications, obtain at least a 2-week supply of prescription and non-prescription medications, and ensure vaccinations are up-to-date. Keep your regularly scheduled medical appointments. If a medical emergency happens, do not delay going to the Emergency Room or calling 911 because of concern about COVID-19.
Additionally, these individuals should take the following precautions to reduce the risk of exposure to COVID-19:

Avoid leaving home as much as possible. If you must leave home, try to maintain a distance of at least six feet between you and people outside your household.
Wash your hands often.
Keep these items on hand and use them when venturing out: a cloth face covering, tissues, and a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, if possible.
Cover your mouth and nose with a cloth face covering when around others to protect other people in case you are infected, and ask others to do the same. For more information about cloth face coverings, including how to make one, please see CDC’s guidance here.
Limit contact with frequently touched services. Clean and disinfect these surfaces when possible.
Avoid all cruise travel and non-essential air travel.

Check to see if your facility has guidance on how to don and doff PPE. The procedure to don and doff should be tailored to the specific type of PPE that you have available at your facility.
If your facility does not have specific guidance, the CDC has recommended sequences for donning and doffing of PPEpdf icon.
It is important for HCP to perform hand hygiene after removing PPE. Hand hygiene should be performed by using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60-95% alcohol or washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.  If hands are visibly soiled, soap and water should be used before returning to alcohol-based hand sanitizer. <SEP> How do I put on (don) or take off (doff) my gloves? <EOS>
In a situation where there is no choice — such as if the grandparent lives with the grandchildren — then the family should do everything they can to try to limit the risk of COVID-19. The grandchildren should be isolated as much as possible, as should the parents, so that the overall family risk is as low as possible. Everyone should wash their hands very frequently throughout the day, and surfaces should be wiped clean frequently. Physical contact should be limited to the absolutely necessary; as wonderful as it can be to snuggle with Grandma or Grandpa, now is not the time. <SEP> I live with my children and grandchildren.

There are many different kinds of coronavirus. Some only affect animals.
Some have been circulating among human beings for years, causing mild
colds. Others have caused small, severe human disease outbreaks in the
past, such as the coronaviruses that caused SARS in 2003 and MERS in 2012.
The new coronavirus is different from these, and was only identified in
December 2019.

It is difficult to estimate what percentage of the US population will become infected with COVID-19. However, some researchers have made educated guesses. Modeling work is based on many assumptions about infection transmissibility, population characteristics, effectiveness of policy measures, etc. – changing these assumptions changes the estimates. Some estimates put the total US population that would be infected during the pandemic without intervention at between 20-60%. A modeling analysis published from the Imperial College of London predicted that in the absence of control measures and changes in individual behavior, 81% of the US population would become infected.

The decision to stop hydroxychloroquine’s use in the Solidarity trial does not apply to the use or evaluation of hydroxychloroquine in pre or post-exposure prophylaxis in patients exposed to COVID-19. <SEP> What is WHO’s view of the use of hydroxychloroquine in pre or post-exposure prophylaxis? <EOS>
No. You can travel irrespective of distance, but you should take hygiene and safety precautions if using services on the way.
You can use public transport but it is better to travel in other ways if possible. It is difficult to socially distance during car journeys and transmission of coronavirus can definitely occur in this context. So avoid travelling with someone from outside your household or your support bubble unless you can practise social distancing.
Further guidance on car sharing is available. If you need to use public transport, you should follow the safer travel guidance for passengers. When travelling on public transport you are legally required to wear a face covering.
If visiting other parts of the UK – Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland – you must adhere to the laws and guidance of the devolved administrations at all times. If you wish to travel internationally, you should follow the laws of other countries and FCO international travel guidance. Upon return to the UK, you must by law self-isolate for 14 days, unless you have come from one of the countries listed here. This is crucial to help to ensure the virus does not spread across borders. <SEP> 3.1 Are there restrictions on how far I can travel? <EOS>
In this temporary guidance for receiving facilities and FSVP importers, the FDA made clear its intent in certain circumstances related to impact of the coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19), not to enforce requirements in three foods regulations to conduct onsite audits of food suppliers if other supplier verification methods are used instead. The three regulations are:
Current Good Manufacturing Practice, Hazard Analysis, and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Human Food (21 CFR part 117)
Current Good Manufacturing Practice, Hazard Analysis, and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Food for Animals (21 CFR part 507)
Foreign Supplier Verification Programs for Importers of Food for Humans and Animals (21 CFR part 1 subpart L)

A return to work policy for staff who have been infected and recovered from COVID-19 should be in place. WHO recommends that a confirmed patient could be released from isolation once their symptoms resolve and they have two negative PCR tests at least 24 hours apart.  If testing is not possible, WHO recommends that a confirmed patient can be released from isolation 14 days after symptoms resolve. Taking the temperature of food workers is not recommended. Fever is only one of the symptoms of COVID-19 and absence of fever alone is not a reliable indicator of wellness. As part of a food business ‘fitness to work’ guidelines, staff should report to management if they are sick with typical COVID-19 symptoms, particularly fever. <SEP> When can an employee return to work following illness? Are temperature checks appropriate? <EOS>
Yes, you should contact your healthcare professional just like you would at any other time. You should not delay in seeking medical care if you are concerned about your health, but call your healthcare provider before visiting the office.
If you are concerned about visiting your doctor, ask about what telehealth services they may offer. Your doctor’s office may ask screening questions, limit the number of people who can be in the office at any one time, require face masks, and introduce other processes to keep you safe. <SEP> Can I go to my doctor’s office for other health concerns? <EOS>
These steps can't guarantee that you won't get coronavirus, or any other illness, because viruses can spread person-to-person. But cleaning all the surfaces you touch will make you much safer and reduce your chances of getting sick. <SEP> .>. Does this prevent me from getting corona? <EOS>
COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning how it spreads. The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to mainly spread from close contact (i.e., within about 6 feet) with a person who is currently sick with COVID-19. The virus likely spreads primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory infections spread. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. This type of spread is not a concern after death.
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
People should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of COVID-19. Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness. There may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing. Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible. If washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, families are encouraged to work with their community cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible. At a minimum, people conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves. If splashing of fluids is expected, additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be required (such as disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and facemask).
Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturer's instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application method and contact time, etc.). Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens
are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses. After removal of PPE, perform hand hygiene by washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available. Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled.

Although there have been a few reports of pets becoming sick with COVID-19 in the United States, this is a new virus and it is not fully understood. For this reason, it is recommended that people sick with COVID-19 limit contact with animals, just as you would restrict your contact with other people. There is some indication that pets can contract the virus from people in the household who have been sick with COVID-19. Out of an abundance of caution, persons ill with COVID-19 should have another member of your household or business take care of feeding and otherwise caring for any animals, including pets, whenever possible. If you have a service animal or you must care for your animals, including pets, wear a cloth face mask; don’t pet, share food, kiss, or hug them, or allow your pet to lick you; and wash your hands before and after any contact with your pet, service animal, and their supplies. You should not share dishes, drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils, towels, or bedding with other people or pets in your home. <SEP> Can I give COVID-19 to my pet? <EOS>
NIH understands the potential effects of COVID-19 on the progress of NIH supported research. Recipients must report any effects on the NIH funded research in their next RPPR submission. Recipients are not to submit standard letters, but rather report these details within the RPPR.

A specialized diagnostic test must be done to confirm that a person has an active coronavirus infection. Most often a clinician takes a swab of your nose (or both your nose and throat). Some tests may be done using a saliva sample. The sample is then checked for the virus's genetic material (PCR test) or for specific viral proteins (antigen test).Antibody tests can tell if someone has been infected with COVID-19. But the infected person doesn't begin producing antibodies immediately. It can take as long as three weeks for a blood antibody test to turn positive. That's why it is not useful as a diagnostic test for someone with new symptoms. <SEP> How is someone tested for COVID-19? <EOS>

Casinos, including casino gaming floors and retail sports wagering lounges, can reopen, while complying with mitigation requirements.
Casinos must comply with all requirements from Executive Order No. 157, Executive Order No. 158, and the Division of Gaming Enforcement and with reopening protocols from the Casino Association of New Jersey.
What to Expect at Casinos
The following summarizes some of the protocols contained in EO 157, EO 158, and the reopening plan from the Casino Association of New Jersey. However, this summary is not a replacement for fully complying with the terms of EO 157, EO 158, and any and all additional requirements imposed by the Division of Gaming Enforcement, including Casino Association of New Jersey protocols. Casinos should read the full guidance carefully to ensure full compliance.
Reopening protocols at casinos include:

Guests and employees will be required to wear masks in all public areas; guests will be asked to be briefly lower masks for cage transactions for surveillance coverage purposes.
Employees will be screen for fever and COVID-19 symptoms at the beginning of their work shift and guests will be screened by employees through questions about symptoms and possible contact with COVID-19.
Promote social distancing and hygiene by establishing spacing and adding appropriate signage.
Limit total number of patrons in and around gaming areas of a casino hotel facility to 25 percent of total occupancy limits, not including employees.
Cordon off any indoor or outdoor dance floors to the public;
Sanitizer stations will be placed throughout the casino hotel complex.
The consumption of food and beverages will not be allowed in any indoor area open to the public.
Smoking in indoor areas is prohibited.
Indoor showrooms and nightclubs are closed.
At table games and at gaming machines, there must be one empty position between a single guest and another unrelated guest.
Total number of players at a gaming table will be limited (eg, 3 players per blackjack table)
By July 16, all table games will have Plexiglas or glass barriers installed between dealer/game operator and guests.
Casinos will adhere to additional cleaning and disinfecting protocols.
Individuals who are at a casino at a specific time, a specific location, and for a common reason, such as a poker tournament, are subject to the State's gathering limits, currently restricting indoor capacity at 100 people or 25% of a room's capacity.

Information for Employees

Employees must wear masks in all public areas, in hotel rooms, and when less than 6 feet from a co-worker or guest.
Employees shall maintain a distance of 6 feet from guests and co-workers, when possible.
Hand sanitizer or sanitizing wipes will be at every timeclock station, sanitizer stations will be placed throughout back of house areas, and sanitizer fluid or wipes will be provided in employee cafeteria.
Employees will be educated on COVID-19 and instructed to stay home if they do not feel well or have any signs or symptoms of COVID-19.
Where possible, employee break areas, cafeteria, training areas, and locker rooms will be set up such that employees can maintain 6 feet of separation.
Employees will be provided with a list of COVID-19 viral testing opportunities in Atlantic County and testing information will be posted near each employee entrance and in the employee cafeteria.
Employees will be screened at the beginning of their work shift for fever and COVID-19 symptoms and will be trained on the policy for sending employees home, employee self-quarantine, and return to work.
The casino hotel complex will arrange for COVID-19 testing for any employee who is not permitted to work at no cost to the employee, provide material on preventing the spread of COVID-19, and encourage employees to contact local health provider.
Employees who can do their job at home will be allowed to continue working from home as long as practicable.

While some UV light devices are used for hospital disinfection, UV light only kills germs under very specific conditions — including certain irradiation dosages and exposure times, the World Health Organization said. 
But UV light can also damage the body. 
Two factors are required for UV light to destroy a virus: intensity and time. If the light is intense enough to break apart a virus in a short time, it’s going to be dangerous to people, said Donald Milton, a professor at the University of Maryland. 
UVA and UVB light both damage the skin. UVC light is safer for skin, but it will damage tender tissue such as the eyes.
And don’t be fooled by claims that hot weather will kill coronavirus.
“You can catch COVID-19 no matter how sunny or hot the weather is,” the WHO said. “Countries with hot weather have reported cases of COVID-19.” <SEP> Can UV light kill coronavirus? <EOS>
For most people, yes. Executive Order 2020-24(1) suspends strict compliance with the Michigan Employment Security Act’s disqualification provisions, MCL 421.29(1)(a), to provide that people who are laid off or leave for medical reasons related to COVID-19 are not disqualified from benefits. This includes those who become ill, those in self-isolation or quarantine, those with exposure to COVID-19, those needing to care for family diagnosed with COVID-19, and those with sudden family care responsibilities arising from government directives (e.g., caring for children who are out of school). Note that the order does not suspend all of the possible disqualification reasons, so if you are unemployed for reasons unrelated to COVID-19, the usual disqualification provisions could still apply. <SEP> Can I apply for unemployment insurance benefits if I'm out of work due to COVID-19? <EOS>
The more granular and specific we can get with the data, the more helpful it will be. Cities and hospitals can work with county or state health departments to get this information for the communities they serve. The CDC has made an effort to weight data based on the particular communities within a state, to account for the difference in distribution of people of different racial and ethnic groups across a larger geographic area. It’s even more informative to have the data at a zip code or neighborhood level, if possible.
We should also realize a lot of the data presented in the media is not adjusted for age. The white population is older, on average, than most populations of color. If we accounted for age differences, we would find that African Americans are actually dying at even higher rates than expected because they're younger than the white population. There are lots of other things that need to be taken into account, but more granular information is most helpful.

Infections among health care workers are not inevitable. Singapore has had over 1,000 infections and hardly any among health care workers. Those few infections that did occur appear to have happened in the community, not in health care. They did that not with high-tech interventions but by ensuring consistent practices and policies, not just with PPE but also through what is called the “hierarchy of controls.” Those are source control (e.g., patients not coming in unless very ill, and all patients wearing a mask), engineering control (e.g., partitions in triage areas), administrative controls (e.g., cohorting of health care workers to reduce transmission among them), and personal controls (PPE) so that you reduce the amount of virus and the exposures. Meticulous attention to detail is crucial. (Dr. Tom Frieden, 4/21/20) <SEP> How can frontline health care workers protect their families? <EOS>
You should take many of the same precautions as you would if you were caring for someone with the flu:
Stay in another room or be separated from the person as much as possible. Use a separate bedroom and bathroom, if available.
Make sure that shared spaces in the home have good air flow. Turn on an air conditioner or open a window.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60 to 95% alcohol, covering all surfaces of your hands and rubbing them together until they feel dry. Use soap and water if your hands are visibly dirty.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
Extra precautions:
You and the person should wear a face mask if you are in the same room.
Wear a disposable face mask and gloves when you touch or have contact with the person's blood, stool, or body fluids, such as saliva, sputum, nasal mucus, vomit, urine.
	
Throw out disposable face masks and gloves after using them. Do not reuse.
First remove and throw away gloves. Then, immediately clean your hands with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Next, remove and throw away the face mask, and immediately clean your hands again with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer.


Do not share household items such as dishes, drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils, towels, bedding, or other items with the person who is sick. After the person uses these items, wash them thoroughly.
Clean all "high-touch" surfaces, such as counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables, every day. Also, clean any surfaces that may have blood, stool, or body fluids on them. Use a household cleaning spray or wipe.
Wash laundry thoroughly.
	
Immediately remove and wash clothes or bedding that have blood, stool, or body fluids on them.
Wear disposable gloves while handling soiled items and keep soiled items away from your body. Clean your hands immediately after removing your gloves.


Place all used disposable gloves, face masks, and other contaminated items in a lined container before disposing of them with other household waste.

It feels a lot like 2008, doesn’t it? Peter S. Goodman, an economics correspondent for The Times, says there’s a key difference between that economic turmoil and today’s: the utter unpredictability of the outbreak’s spread. 
“The disaster feels eerily familiar, with trillions of dollars in wealth annihilated near-daily and deepening fears that businesses will fail,” he writes. “Yet the traditional policy prescriptions seem no match for the affliction at hand.”
But even the 2008 crisis pales in comparison to the scale of the destruction wrought by the coronavirus. The United States lost 20 million jobs in a single month, a fall that one expert called "literally off the charts." And the very means of controlling the health crisis — keeping workers home, limiting travel and disrupting commerce — risk making the economic crisis worse.

If washing the body, shrouding, or other important religious or cultural practices are observed in a specific tribal community, families are encouraged to consider this guidance and work with their cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible.
If you participate in these activities, wear disposable gloves (nitrile, latex, or rubber). And you may need additional equipment (called personal protective equipment, or PPE). For example, you may need the following:

Disposable, waterproof isolation gown
Face shield or goggles
Facemask

Following preparation of the body remove PPE and throw away. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.

I have not seen a specific concern about people passing out with masks. Sometimes it is hard to breathe through a medical-grade N95 or other industrial masks, but a loose-fitting cloth mask shouldn't be a challenge. If people are having trouble breathing through a mask, they should loosen it. A member of the public should never have trouble breathing in one.
During the 1918 flu pandemic flu there was an anti-mask league. There's a long history of people not wanting to wear masks in this country. This is an example of where it's important to find people who are community leaders in different ways—faith leaders, ideally bipartisan leaders—who can explain that they're wearing masks to protect other people, and they hope others will wear masks to protect them. Making it less about a rule and more about it being the right thing to do is really what motivates people and creates the cultural expectation that people will wear masks. (Dr. Josh Sharfstein, 5/19/20) <SEP> How should we respond to claims that masks are actually bad for the wearer’s health or cause oxygen deprivation? <EOS>
​Yes, your employer is

The most important thing to know about coronavirus on surfaces is that they can easily be cleaned with common household disinfectants that will kill the virus. Studies have shown that the COVID-19 virus can survive for up to 72 hours on plastic and stainless steel, less than 4 hours on copper and less than 24 hours on cardboard.
As, always clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Avoid touching your eyes, mouth, or nose. <SEP> How long does the virus survive on surfaces? <EOS>
Testing run by the State of Delaware at community-based sites are free, however if you have health insurance, you may be asked to provide that information.

It is not yet known whether weather and temperature affect the spread of COVID-19. Some other viruses, like the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months, but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months. From the evidence so far, the COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in all areas, including those with hot and humid weather. <SEP> Will warm weather stop the outbreak of COVID-19? <EOS>
Call your doctor if you have fever, cough, and shortness of breath and have recently returned from travel or come into contact with an infected person. Tell them you suspect you may have COVID-19 and ask your doctor what to do. They will likely tell you to either stay home and isolate yourself or go to an isolated medical setting for testing. State public health labs and the CDC are handling all testing as of March 2020, and there could be a backlog in your area. 

Call ahead to your doctor or to a hospital and let them know that you want to come in and you suspect you have COVID-19. Giving them this warning will allow them to make preparations so you don't spread the disease to others if you do have it.
If you have a medical emergency, let emergency responders know when you call them that you suspect you have COVID-19 so they can also take precautions. They will likely isolate you in a negative pressure room so it’s less likely the virus will infect others.
If you are outside the United States, your national health agency or the World Health Organization (WHO) will likely manage testing in your area. <SEP> What should I do if I think I'm sick with COVID-19? <EOS>
These tests tell us someone has been exposed to SARS-CoV-2. We don’t know if everyone who has been exposed develops antibodies.
But the key is: just because you have antibodies, doesn’t mean you’re protected from reinfection.
We can’t say exposure means you’ll never get it again. If you’re protected, we don’t know for how long. Research is happening right now to learn more about this. <SEP> What do these tests tell us (and not tell us)? <EOS>
In work areas at high risk, assess the possibility of suspending the activity; enhance regular hand hygiene; provide medical masks, disposable gowns, gloves, and eye protection for workers who must work in the homes of people who are suspected or known to have COVID-19; train workers in infection prevention and control practices and use of personal protective equipment; avoid assigning tasks with high risk to workers who have pre-existing medical conditions, are pregnant, or older than 60 years of age. <SEP> What additional measures should be taken at workplaces and for jobs at high risk? <EOS>
"Without symptoms" can refer to two groups of people: those who eventually do have symptoms (pre-symptomatic) and those who never go on to have symptoms (asymptomatic). During this pandemic, we have seen that people without symptoms can spread the coronavirus infection to others.A person with COVID-19 may be contagious 48 to 72 hours before starting to experience symptoms. In fact, people without symptoms may be more likely to spread the illness, because they are unlikely to be isolating and may not adopt behaviors designed to prevent spread.But what about people who never go on to develop symptoms? A recent study compared the amount of coronavirus in the nose, throat, and lungs of symptomatic and asymptomatic adults infected with SARS-CoV-2 (the COVID-19 coronavirus). Both groups of patients had similar amounts of virus in their bodies throughout the infection. This study did not look at the degree to which people with asymptomatic infections may infect others.This study provides yet another reason to wear face masks and observe physical distancing. Both measures can help reduce the risk that someone who does not have symptoms will infect others. <SEP> Do people without symptoms have the same amount of coronavirus in their bodies as people with symptoms? And can people without symptoms spread the virus to others? <EOS>
Doctors and researchers are working on medicines and a vaccine for coronavirus.
               Most people with the illness, including children, get better with rest, fluids, and
               fever-reducing medicine. People with more severe symptoms may need treatment in the
               hospital. <SEP> How Is Coronavirus (COVID-19) Treated? <EOS>
Scientists are currently testing different types of antivirals that work against influenza, HIV, and even Ebola, to see if they are effective against COVID-19 virus.
Remdesivir is one treatment that's been shown in a clinical trial to have an effect on COVID-19. Preliminary results from that trial, which included sites worldwide, found that the drug reduced patients' length of hospital stay by about four days, from 15 days, on average, to 11 days. The ongoing trial did not show the drug had a significant impact on deaths.
Dexamethasone, a cheap, widely available steroid, has been shown to reduce deaths by one-third among patients on mechanical ventilators, and by one-fifth among patients receiving supplemental oxygen by other means.
In addition, there are clinical trials of other drugs, including favipiravir, ribavirin and galidesivir.
The Milken Institute is curating a resource that tracks COVID-19 treatments and vaccine progress.

Cleaning with soap and water removes germs, dirt, and impurities from surfaces. It lowers the risk of spreading infection. Disinfecting kills germs on surfaces. By killing germs on a surface after cleaning, it can further lower the risk of spreading infection. <SEP> What is the difference between cleaning and disinfecting? <EOS>
If you choose to breastfeed:

Breast milk provides protection against many illnesses and is the best source of nutrition for most infants. 
You, along with your family and healthcare providers, should decide whether and how to start or continue breastfeeding.
We do not know for sure if mothers with COVID-19 can spread the virus to babies in their breast milk, but the limited data available suggest this is not likely.

If you have COVID-19 and choose to breastfeed:

Wear a cloth face covering while breastfeeding.  Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds before each feeding.

If you have COVID-19 and choose to express breast milk:

Use a dedicated breast pump (not shared).
Wear a cloth face covering during expression and wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds before touching any pump or bottle parts and before expressing breast milk.
Follow recommendations for proper pump cleaning after each use, cleaning all parts that come into contact with breast milk.
If possible, expressed breast milk should be fed to the infant by a healthy caregiver who does not have COVID-19, is not at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19, and is living in the same home.

Based on the current best available scientific evidence, COVID-related risks in schools serving elementary-age students (grades TK-6) are lower than and different from the risks to staff and to students in schools serving older students. In particular, there appears to be lower risk of child-to-child or child-to-adult transmission in children under age 12, and the risk of infection and serious illness in elementary school children is particularly low. <SEP> Why does the waiver only apply to elementary schools and not middle or high schools? <EOS>
The coronavirus may remain detectable for hours to days on surfaces made from a variety of materials, including clothing. It is not known how infectious this virus is, and it is less infectious over time. In addition, the absorbent fibers in some clothing may cause the virus to dry up more quickly than it does on plastics and metals. Washing clothing is thought to be sufficient to inactive the virus. Wash clothing on the warmest possible setting appropriate for the material and dry completely.

Businesses are required to check the temperature of employees upon discovery that the business has been exposed to a person who is a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case. However, the Department of Health recommends that employers check the temperature and or symptoms of all employees at the beginning of each shift, particularly in those areas of the Commonwealth with high positive case numbers. This can be done in several ways:
If thermometers can be procured:

— Employers may take their employees’ temperatures on site utilizing best practices.
— Employees may self-screen taking their temperature at home with business-provided thermometers or their own personal thermometer.

If thermometers cannot be procured:

— Employers may ask their employees to conduct a questionnaire-based screening at the worksite utilizing the Department approved screening tool or equivalent.
— Employees may self-screen by conducting a questionnaire-based screening at their home utilizing the Department approved screening tool or equivalent.

If utilizing self-screening, businesses must also establish a policy for employees to report their temperature or symptoms to the employer on a daily basis. This policy should include a provision that would not allow employees with symptoms to come onto the worksite.
Additionally, businesses should consider paid leave policies that incentivize workers to stay home when reporting symptoms, including a temperature of 100.4 F or higher. This would alleviate the potential of employees lying to avoid losing pay, or potentially losing jobs.
Daily self-screening is encouraged even if the employee is not scheduled to enter the worksite. For example, if an employee is off for the weekend, performing a self -screening is not required but a matter of good public health. <SEP> Businesses are required to check the temperature of employees upon discovery that the business has been exposed to a person who is a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case.

The onset and duration of viral shedding and the period of infectiousness for COVID-19 are not yet known. It is possible that SARS-CoV-2 RNA may be detectable in the upper or lower respiratory tract for weeks after illness onset, similar to infections with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. However, detection of viral RNA does not necessarily mean that infectious virus is present.
There are reports of asymptomatic infections (detection of virus with no development of symptoms) and pre-symptomatic infections (detection of virus prior to development of symptoms) with SARS-CoV-2. For the purposes of contact tracing, a close contact is defined as being within 6 feet of a person with COVID-19 for at least 15 minutes or having exposure to the person’s respiratory secretions (for example, being coughed or sneezed on; sharing a drinking glass or utensils; kissing) while they were contagious. A person with COVID-19 is considered to be contagious starting from 2 days before they became sick (or 2 days before they tested positive if they never had symptoms) until they meet the criteria to discontinue isolation.
Based on existing literature, the incubation period (the time from exposure to development of symptoms) of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses (e.g. MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV) ranges from 2–14 days, with an average of 5 days.

Fear is best dealt with by taking action to manage the situation effectively, allowing you to replace fear with a sense of control. In this situation, if you live away from your elderly relatives, stop visiting but stay in touch via Skype, Zoom, etc. and phone calls. Leave groceries and other supplies for them but don't go inside. If you live with them, take all precautions you can, such as working from home where possible to avoid interacting with others outside who might have the virus, washing your hands often, keeping high standards of hygiene in the home environment, etc. If you do work outside of home in one of the essential services or healthcare, consider relocating temporarily to avoid increasing the chances of bringing home the virus.

The virus that causes COVID-19 has been found in the feces of some patients diagnosed with COVID-19. However, it is unclear whether the virus found in feces may be capable of causing COVID-19. There has not been any confirmed report of the virus spreading from feces to a person. Scientists also do not know how much risk there is that the virus could be spread from the feces of an infected person to another person.

While the WHO does not recommend and advises against the application of any travel restrictions based on the information currently available on COVID-19, as an occupational health measure, it is recommended that for all official travel, UN managers and/or UN personnel undertake a risk assessment to evaluate the criticality of the proposed travel balanced against the risks to the traveler for any travel to or meetings in affected areas experiencing ongoing transmission of COVID-19. This includes risks posed by both medical issues and evolving travel/border restrictions enacted by states parties.
Please be aware that local authorities may begin to implement travel restrictions and health screening measures for travelers entering or exiting the country. All UN personnel who are planning to travel should check with the destination countries’ embassy, consulate, or Ministry of Health and keep up to date with local health advice before and during your travel.

These times are emotionally challenging as organized sports have suddenly stopped, and a competition or event that you or your child may have been working toward has been cancelled, which can cause stress or feelings of sadness. Acknowledge and validate those feelings and help discuss with your child ways to still feel connected to a particular sport or team such as weekly virtual check-ins with teammates or online leader boards for family workouts. Exercises that promote positive imagery can also help. That nurtured connectedness is key to maintaining mental wellness. In addition, focusing on being active instead of being the absolute best can help take away performance pressure and additional stress. <SEP> Give yourself and your athlete acceptance and empathy <EOS>
Quarantine: This is when someone who might have been exposed
               to the virus but has no symptoms needs to stay home for 14 days (2 weeks). <SEP> What Does Quarantine Mean? <EOS>
Many countries are implementing travel restrictions and mandatory quarantines, closing borders, and prohibiting non-citizens from entry with little advance notice. If you choose to travel internationally, your travel plans may be disrupted. If you get sick or are exposed to a person with COVID-19 during your trip, you may be isolated or quarantined and your return to the United States may be delayed.
For the most up-to-date information on travel advisories, please visit CDC’s travel advisory website and the U.S. Department of State website. <SEP> If I fly internationally, am I going to get stuck there, or will I be able to fly back to the U.S.? <EOS>
Yes, you are able to.  A South Korean study shows that asymptomatic people may have just as much of the virus in their throat, lungs, and nose as symptomatic individuals do.  With this in mind, regular exhales can move the virus along a sizable distance. 
Many asymptomatic people may not realize that they have the virus, so they may not be distancing themselves from others. This raises the risk by quite a bit. <SEP> Can you transmit COVID-19 asymptomatically? <EOS>
No. If you are offered work by your employer and refuse to accept it, without good cause, you may no longer be eligible for UC. Determining whether there was good cause for a refusal of work is driven by the facts of each claimant’s circumstances. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, if an employee refuses to return to work because they are at high risk of complications from the virus and their employer cannot make reasonable accommodations for them, or if they were being asked to return to work at reduced hours that result in them earning less than they did before the pandemic, UC staff would review those specific reasons and make determinations based on the facts of their individual cases.  If you do return to work at reduced hours, and this results in a reduced weekly income compared to your weekly income prior to filing for UC, you may be eligible for partial UC plus the $600 FPUC per week. <SEP> ​My employer offered me my job back, but I would make more staying on Unemployment.  Can I do this? <EOS>

Decisions to test should be based on a number of factors including a link to a known human or animal infected with SARS-CoV-2, detection of atypical patterns of animal illness (particularly in a congregate or shelter-type setting) and/or in association with an academic research institution.
Veterinarians are encouraged to take a thorough history to assess for likely SARS-CoV-2 exposure or risk factors in the 2 weeks prior to symptom onset (such as whether the animal has been in in close contact with a person or animal suspected or confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, a person with COVID-19 compatible symptoms, or had recent exposure to a known high-risk environment, such as a nursing home) and consider other, more common causes of illness. Veterinarians with additional questions about testing for SARS-CoV-2 are encouraged to contact either their State Public Health Veterinarian or their State Veterinarian. State animal health officials and public health officials will work together in consultation with federal partners when considering testing an animal for SARS-CoV-2. <SEP> How would the decision be made to test an animal for SARS-CoV-2? <EOS>

Even if the person in quarantine or isolation does not have symptoms, all members
               of the household should:

Stay home as much
               as possible.
Wear a mask and stay 6 feet away from others if they need to go out.
Wear a mask if they need to be in the room with the person who is in isolation
               or quarantine.
Make sure shared spaces in the home have good air flow. You can open a window
               or turn on an air filter or air conditioner.
Not have any visitors into the home.
Wash their hands well and often. Wash with soap and water for at least 20 seconds,
               or use alcohol-based hand sanitizer.

Other ways to lower the risk of spreading the virus:

If doing
               the laundry of the person in quarantine or isolation, wash it with detergent on
               the hottest temperature possible. To avoid sending the virus into the air, don't shake
               the laundry. Wear gloves, if possible. Wash hands well after handling the laundry,
               even if you wore gloves.
Every day, use a household cleaner or wipe to clean things that get touched a
               lot. These include doorknobs, light switches, toys, remote controls, sink handles,

Animals imported from China will need to meet CDC and USDA requirements for entering the United States. At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals including pets can spread COVID-19. As with any animal introduced to a new environment, animals recently imported from China should be observed daily for signs of illness. If an animal becomes ill, the animal should be examined by a veterinarian. Call your local veterinary clinic before bringing the animal into the clinic and let them know that the animal was recently in China.

The testing strategy is different for different times and places. Where tests are scarce, we encourage people with mild symptoms not to get tested. If your city has testing capacity and only a few cases, you should be recommending the opposite: that everyone with symptoms get tested so they can be contact traced and isolated and their contacts quarantined. But wherever public health and healthcare systems are stressed, individuals with mild symptoms seeking tests may infect others and use up scarce resources such as test kits, protective equipment, healthcare supplies, and worker time.
If you test positive and your symptoms are not severe in an area with widespread transmission, the recommendation will be to stay home, which is exactly what you would have done if you had not had a test. The key is to coordinate with your health department and doctor to see when testing and contact tracing get turned on and off. (Dr. Tom Frieden, 4/2/20) <SEP> What happens when you have too many people who need tests and too many people to be contact traced? <EOS>

Some French doctors advise against using ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil, many generic versions) for COVID-19 symptoms based on reports of otherwise healthy people with confirmed COVID-19 who were taking an NSAID for symptom relief and developed a severe illness, especially pneumonia. These are only observations and not based on scientific studies.The WHO initially recommended using acetaminophen instead of ibuprofen to help reduce fever and aches and pains related to this coronavirus infection, but now states that either acetaminophen or ibuprofen can be used. Rapid changes in recommendations create uncertainty. Since some doctors remain concerned about NSAIDs, it still seems prudent to choose acetaminophen first, with a total dose not exceeding 3,000 milligrams per day.However, if you suspect or know you have COVID-19 and cannot take acetaminophen, or have taken the maximum dose and still need symptom relief, taking over-the-counter ibuprofen does not need to be specifically avoided. <SEP> Is it safe to take ibuprofen to treat symptoms of COVID-19? <EOS>

Medicolegal death investigators may supervise or be involved in the transportation of human remains. The following are important considerations for preparation and transport of a decedent where COVID-19 infection is known or suspected:

Current CDC guidance recommends standard body bagging procedures for decedents with suspected COVID-19 (consistent with those for decedents where COVID-19 is not suspected). This includes the use of a single body bag (minimum 6 mil thickness) that is wiped down with an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-approved disinfectantexternal icon after the decedent has been placed inside.
When handling the body, the following PPE should be worn:

A single pair of non-sterile disposable medical examination gloves. However, heavy-duty tear-resistant gloves preferably with coverage above the wrists (or double pair of disposable gloves) should be worn over the examination gloves if there is a risk of cuts, tears, punctures, abrasions, or hazards on or around the body that could penetrate the skin.
Clean, long-sleeved fluid-resistant or impermeable isolation gown for barrier protection of skin and clothing.
Disposable facemask.
Goggles or face shield that covers the front and sides of the face.
Shoe coverings with non-slip tread.


The investigator should be aware of special circumstances that may warrant the use of two or more body bags or bags of stronger material (e.g., 8 mil or thicker), such as:

Decedents’ body weights and sizes vary greatly as does construction and conditions of body bags and bag handles. Investigators should use prudent judgement determining if risks for puncture, tearing, or failure of body bags could occur and whether a second body bag or a body bag of thicker, stronger material is necessary. Refer to body bag weight capacities, if available.
Presence of sharp objects on the decedent that could cause punctures or tears (e.g., jewelry or piercings).
Thickness of the initial body bag (6 mil, 8 mil, 15 mil, etc.)
Presence of body fluids that could pose exposure risks to workers handling and/or transporting the body should a puncture, tear, or failure to the initial body bag occur. Standard precautions should always be taken to prevent exposure to bloodborne pathogens.
Visible contamination on the outside of the body bag that occurred by contact with the environs or during body transport.


It is good practice to wipe down the outside of the bag with an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-approved disinfectant external iconbefore putting the body in the transport vehicle. This protects death care workers who may be in contact with the bag in the future. <SEP> What should medicolegal death investigators know about transportation of human remains in cases of suspected or confirmed COVID-19? <EOS>

If you do not have health insurance or lose coverage, you may be eligible for free or low-cost coverage (www.njfamilycare.org) through NJ FamilyCare, New Jersey's publicly funded health insurance program. NJ Family Care includes CHIP, Medicaid and Medicaid expansion populations and covers doctor visits, prescriptions, vision, dental care, mental health and substance use services and even hospitalization.
Protections From Discrimination and Harassment
Under the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination (LAD), a place of public accommodation, which includes a doctor's office, hospital, clinic, testing site, or other medical facility cannot discriminate against you because of your actual or perceived race, national origin, religion, disability, or other LAD-protected characteristic.
This means medical facilities must ensure they do not discriminate in their provision of services, including the provision of tests or care related to COVID-19. For example, it is unlawful for a medical facility to discriminate in the administration of COVID-19 tests or provide different levels of COVID-19 treatment to Black and white patients because of their race.
Medical facilities also must take action to stop harassment based on LAD-protected characteristics if they know or should have known about it, even if the harassment comes from another patient.

The most important aspect of scenario analysis is getting people to imagine the alternatives. That conversation spreads out their thinking, so that they are no longer focused on optimizing against a single scenario or accustomed way of thinking.
You give the problem to them and ask, “what are some issues that might arise?” The decision makers might have a lot of experience and knowledge. But this situation is unprecedented, so everyone needs to be cautious about whether we’re getting it right and aware of why things might go wrong. Encourage them to think through those possibilities, and that will get them to start thinking about how they will optimize against all the different possible futures. (Dutch Leonard, 5/29/20)

Most viruses don’t spread easily on airplanes because of how the air circulates and is filtered, the CDC says. 
Modern commercial jets recirculate 10-50% of the air in the cabin, mixed with outside air. 
                “The recirculated air passes through a series of filters 20-30 times per hour,” the CDC says. 
“Furthermore, air generally circulates in defined areas within the aircraft, thus limiting the radius of distribution of pathogens spread by small-particle aerosols. As a result, the cabin air environment is not conducive to the spread of most infectious diseases.” <SEP> Since a plane's cabin keeps circulating air, will I get sick if another passenger is sick? <EOS>
The risk depends on where you are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.
For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places around the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to comply with any local restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID-19.
COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in China and some other countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It’s important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go. WHO publishes daily updates on the COVID-19 situation worldwide.

Some treating doctors in France have speculated that non-steroidal anti-inflammatories like Ibuprofen might increase the risk of worsening a COVID infection when used to treat fever, possibly resulting in some people being admitted to intensive care. However, as of 19 March 2020, while the World Health Organization is aware of the concerns relating to this medication, it is still consulting on the matter with treatment physicians and has not confirmed reports of negative effects at this stage. This is something to keep a watching brief over. If you want to avoid Ibuprofen, you can use acetaminophen (e.g. Tylenol, Paracetamol, etc.) instead, which has had no reports of problems made about it. <SEP> Is it not safe to take Ibuprofen for aches caused by COVID-19? <EOS>

No, a waiver from OLAW is not required for institutions employing the flexibilities provided in the PHS Policy that are applicable to a pandemic situation. This includes provisions that may be instituted as social distancing measures to prevent the spread of disease (see NOT-OD-20-088). However, institutions must ensure that all IACUC members are kept apprised of the flexibilities prior to implementation, and that any permanent program changes are included in the 2020 annual report to OLAW. The Assurance should then be updated at the time of renewal if these become part of the institution’s ongoing plan. <SEP> 16.

A positive test result for COVID-19 indicates that RNA from SARS-CoV-2 was detected, and the patient is presumptively infected with SARS-CoV-2 and presumed to be contagious. Laboratory test results should always be considered in the context of clinical observations and epidemiological data in making a final diagnosis and patient management decisions. Patient management should follow current CDC guidelines and NIH Treatment guidelines.

RT-PCR test performance varies by the type of test/manufacturer and other factors, such as timing of specimen collection, type of specimen, and quality of specimen.
RT-PCR tests are typically very specific (99-100%), meaning very few false positives. Please see Table 3 in the IDSA guidelines.
RT-PCR sensitivity will vary. The sensitivity will depend on factors like specimen type and timing of specimen collection. Per IDSA guidelines, sensitivities may range from ~55% for oral specimen to 100% for mid-turbinate specimen. In general, it is best to collect specimens as close to symptom onset as possible or within the first week when viral shedding is believed to be highest (or 5-7 days after exposure, if asymptomatic). Positivity starts to decline around the 3rd week of infection.

The CDC COVID-19 Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel (the test being used by DCLS) has been designed to minimize the likelihood of false positive test results. The current assay has a >95% sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity was assessed with limit of detection studies, with consistent detection at 3 RNA copies/uL. Specificity was assessed with seasonal coronaviruses, MERS,SARS, flu and other respiratory viruses. No cross reactivity with these pathogens was observed when testing with the nCoV assay. However, in the event of a false positive result, risks to patients could include the following: a recommendation for isolation of the patient, monitoring of household or other close contacts for symptoms, patient isolation that might limit contact with family or friends and may increase contact with other potentially COVID-19 infected patients, limits in the ability to work, the delayed diagnosis and treatment for the true infection causing the symptoms, unnecessary prescription of a treatment or therapy, or other unintended adverse effects.

Cloth face coverings:

May be commercially produced or improvised (i.e., homemade) garments, scarves, bandanas, or items made from t-shirts or other  fabrics.
Are worn in public over the nose and mouth to contain the wearer's potentially infectious respiratory droplets produced when  an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks and to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), to others.
Are not considered personal protective equipment (PPE).
Will not protect the wearer against airborne transmissible infectious agents due to loose fit and lack of seal or inadequate filtration.
Are not appropriate substitutes for PPE such as respirators (e.g., N95 respirators) or medical face masks (e.g., surgical masks) in workplaces where respirators or face masks are recommended or required to protect the wearer.
May be used by almost any worker, although those who have trouble breathing or are otherwise unable to put on or remove a mask without assistance should not wear one.
May be disposable or reusable after proper washing.

Surgical masks:

Are typically cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug  Administration as medical devices (though not all devices that look like  surgical masks are actually medical-grade, cleared devices).
Are used to protect workers against splashes and  sprays (i.e., droplets) containing potentially infectious materials. In this  capacity, surgical masks are considered PPE. Under OSHA's PPE standard (29 CFR 1910.132), employers must provide any necessary PPE at no-cost to workers.1
May also be worn to contain the wearer's  respiratory droplets (e.g., healthcare workers, such as surgeons, wear them to  avoid contaminating surgical sites, and dentists and dental hygienists wear  them to protect patients).
Should be placed on sick individuals to prevent the  transmission of respiratory infections that spread by large droplets.
Will not protect the wearer against airborne  transmissible infectious agents due to loose fit and lack of seal or inadequate filtration.
May be used by almost anyone.
Should be properly disposed of after use.

Respirators (e.g., filtering  facepieces):

Are used to prevent workers from inhaling small  particles, including airborne transmissible or aerosolized infectious agents.
Must be provided and used in accordance with OSHA's Respiratory Protection standard (29 CFR 1910.134).

Must  be certified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).

OSHA has temporarily exercised its enforcement discretion concerning supply shortages of disposable filtering  facepiece respirators (FFRs), including as it relates to their extended use or reuse, use beyond their manufacturer's recommended shelf life, use of equipment from certain other countries and jurisdictions, and decontamination.


Need proper filter material (e.g., N95 or better) and, other than for loose-fitting  powered, air purifying respirators (PAPRs), tight fit (to prevent air leaks).
Require proper training, fit testing, availability of appropriate medical evaluations  and monitoring, cleaning, and oversight by a knowledgeable staff member.

OSHA has temporarily exercised its enforcement discretion concerning annual fit testing requirements in the Respiratory Protection standard (29 CFR 1910.134), as long as employers have made good-faith efforts to comply  with the requirements of the standard and to follow the steps outlined in the March 14, 2020, and April 8, 2020, memoranda (as applicable to their industry).


When necessary to protect workers, require a respiratory protection program that is compliant with OSHA's Respiratory Protection standard (29 CFR 1910.134). OSHA consultation staff can assist with understanding  respiratory protection requirements.
FFRs may be used voluntarily, if permitted by the employer. If an employer permits  voluntary use of FFRs, employees must receive the information contained in Appendix D of OSHA's Respiratory Protection standard (29 CFR 1910.134).





1 If surgical masks are being used only as source control—not to protect workers against splashes and sprays (i.e., droplets) containing potentially infectious materials—OSHA's PPE standards do not require employers to provide them to workers. However, the General Duty Clause, Section 5(a)(1) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, requires each employer to furnish to each of his employees employment and a place of employment which are free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm. Control measures may include a combination of engineering and administrative controls, including safe work practices like social  distancing. Choosing to ensure use of surgical masks for source control may constitute a feasible means of abatement as part of a control plan designed to address hazards from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Back to Text <SEP> What are the key differences between cloth face coverings, surgical masks, and respirators? <EOS>
Yes. To determine if residents and HCP have a current infection, they should have a viral test (e.g., reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR]) regardless of their antibody test result. A positive antibody test result shows that an individual has antibodies from an infection with the virus that causes COVID-19, or possibly from infection with a related virus from the same family of viruses (called coronavirus), such as one that causes the common cold. We do not know yet if having antibodies to the virus that causes COVID-19 can protect someone from getting infected again or, if they do, how long this protection might last. Therefore, antibody tests should not be used to diagnose COVID-19 and should not be used to inform infection prevention actions. <SEP> Should residents or HCP who have a positive antibody test for SARS-CoV-2 be tested as part of facility-wide testing? <EOS>
Colorado provides death data related to COVID-19 in two ways:
Deaths caused by COVID-19:
The vital records death data is based on CDC coding of death certificates, and it reflects the number of deaths due to COVID-19, based on the expert judgment of health care providers and coroners. 

		The number comes from death certificates where COVID-19 is listed as the cause of death or a significant condition contributing to death.
This number is determined by the CDC and is updated daily for dates through the previous Saturday.  


Deaths among people who died with COVID-19:
The epidemiological death data reflects people who died with COVID-19, but COVID-19 may not have been the cause of death listed on the death certificate. It comes from two sources:
		From health care providers and laboratories that report cases to the state using a national case definition.
From state-reviewed death certificates where COVID-19 is listed as the cause of death or a significant condition contributing to death. These death certificates may not yet have been coded by the CDC.
This information is required by the CDC and is crucial for public health surveillance, as it provides more information about disease transmission and can help identify risk factors among all deaths across populations. <SEP> What do the death data mean? <EOS>
The term "coronavirus" refers to a large family of viruses that make people sick. Most of these viruses cause the common cold and are very prevalent. Less common strains of coronavirus also cause Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which are serious variations of the virus.  COVID-19 is a new, rare type of coronavirus that came to the public's attention in late 2019. 

The coronavirus we are currently dealing with is new, meaning that it hasn't been seen in people before.
COVID-19 is a term for the respiratory syndrome that can be caused by this new coronavirus, meaning that it causes you to have difficulty breathing. In some cases, it can cause pneumonia. <SEP> What is a coronavirus? <EOS>
Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person through respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen temperatures.

The design of the public pool, hot tub, or water playground and surrounding deck and if visitors live together or not will affect how many people can stay at least 6 feet apart from those they don’t live with.
CDC recommends operators of public pools, hot tubs, and water playgrounds:

comply with local, state, territorial, federal, and tribal regulatory agency policies and requirements on gathering (so the number of swimmers in the water isn’t more than the maximum allowed) and
teach and reinforce social (physical) distancing among visitors and staff.

Operators might want to limit the number of people in and around the water so if the water needs to be evacuated (because of lightning or other health or safety threat) social distancing can be maintained on the deck. Otherwise, if the water is evacuated and social distancing cannot be maintained on the deck, close the deck to visitors. There is no standard formula to determine how many people can maintain social distancing in the water and on the surrounding deck.
See Considerations for Public Pools, Hot Tubs, and Water Playgrounds for more information. <SEP> How many people, visitors and staff, can be in and around a public pool, hot tub, or water playground (such as at an apartment complex or owned by a community) at the same time? <EOS>
Here is guidance from the Defense Health Agency:   

Immunization of uniformed service members is of the highest priority.  The goal is to achieve and maintain readiness.
Military clinics:
    
Provider exams may not be necessary (e.g., well-baby check).  This is a military hospital or clinic decision.
Pediatric clinics:  The priority is for newborns, infants, young children, and those prone to infection (e.g., immune problems).  They are likely to get shots before older children with routine needs. 
Adult Clinics:  The priority is for those prone to infection.  They are likely to get shots before those needing routine shots. 


To limit COVID-19, you may experience:
    
Verbal screening for possible infection,
Separate appointments for immunization versus sick-patient visits, and/or
Separate immunization locations.


Immunization clinics are to inform to parents and patients.  They should tell you about how to catch up on routine immunizations after COVID-19.
Civilian providers and clinics may have similar guidance and processes.   Contact you provider for more specific information.

Note:  Rabies post-exposure treatment is the only immunization considered “urgent”.

Water, Gas, and Electricity
Public water, gas, and electric utility companies regulated by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU) have all agreed to extend their voluntary moratorium preventing shutoffs to both residential and commercial customers until October 15th.
The utilities will offer residential and commercial customers a flexible and extended Deferred Payment Agreement (DPA) of at least 12 months and up to 24 months. No down payments will be required for this assistance.
Customers may start to receive shutoff notices in September. Should that occur, those customers should contact their utility as soon as possible prior to October 15 to make arrangements to continue their utility service, to explore enrolling in a DPA, and to learn about what other assistance programs might be available. However, no customer will be shut off before October 15.
Although utility service shutoffs are still suspended, customers should make payments toward their utility bills if they can.
If you are struggling to pay your utility bills, contact your utility company about assistance programs and payment plans, or visit BPU's "Assistance Programs" page for information about programs that can help.
Note: For any questions about your service, first contact your utility company. A list of public gas and electricity utility company phone numbers is available here.
If you are unable to resolve an issue with your utility company, you should contact BPU's Customer Assistance team by filling out this online form, or by calling (800) 624-0241 and leaving a voicemail.
Phone and Internet
The executive order prohibiting Internet and phone services from being shut off until 30 days after our current public health emergency has ended remains in effect.
All service downgrades, service reductions, or late fees due to nonpayment are prohibited unless they are imposed in accordance with a policy approved by the Board of Public Utilities.
Any Internet or phone service that was disconnected due to nonpayment after March 16 must be reconnected.
Note: A cable or telecommunications provider that provides residential internet and voice services to New Jersey residents may collect 1) a fee or charge imposed for late or otherwise untimely payments that become due from the date of this Order for residential internet or 2) a fee or charge imposed for voice service reconnections, other than what is described below, only if acting pursuant to a policy approved in writing by the Board of Public Utilities as long as this Order remains in effect.

On April 3, 2020, CDC issued a recommendation that people wear a cloth face covering when going to places where social distancing can be difficult to maintain, like grocery stores, especially in areas of significant COVID-19 community spread. VDH concurs with CDC’s recommendation. Cloth face coverings should be washed after each use. Cloth face coverings should not be placed on young children younger than 2 years of age, anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the cover without assistance.
The cloth mask can be purchased or made at home. A video about how to make one at home can be found here. Surgical or medical-grade facemasks or N95 respirators should NOT be used in place of a cloth mask--these medical supplies are greatly needed and reserved for healthcare providers.

You'll probably see lots of health care people wearing masks. Doctors and nurses
               will wear them. Medical people who give therapies and treatments will wear masks.
               They also might wear clear face shields or plastic glasses. Those can help stop germs
               too. In the hospital, people who keep the rooms

While coronavirus is going around, doctors might see people with video visits instead
               of in person. They don't need to wear a mask for that.
Anyone can wear a mask when they need to be near other people. Many people who

Here are examples of activities and situations that can increase your risk of exposure to COVID-19:

Being in an area that is experiencing high levels of COVID-19 spread. You can check the levels for places you traveled, including countries as well as S. states, territories, counties, and cities.
Going to a large social gathering like a wedding, funeral, or party.
Attending a mass gathering like a sporting event, concert, or parade.
Being in crowds — for example, in restaurants, bars, airports, bus and train stations, or movie theaters.

Convalescent plasma is the liquid part of blood from patients who have recovered from an infection, the US Food and Drug Administration says. “Antibodies present in convalescent plasma are proteins that might help fight the infection.”
But just like normal blood donation, donors and recipients must be matched by blood type. Type AB plasma is the only universal type and can be given to patients of any blood type. 
The FDA said patients who are fully recovered from Covid-19 for at least two weeks are encouraged to consider donating plasma.
The Red Cross said there are other requirements for plasma donors: 

You are at least 17 years old and weigh at least 110 pounds. (The age requirement may differ according to organization and state). Other weight requirements apply for donors age 18 or younger.
You must be in good health overall health now. 

 You cannot donate if you are pregnant or have certain conditions, such as HIV or sickle cell disease.

2020-2021 SCHOOL YEAR
Schools may reopen for in-person instruction this fall.
Every school must reopen in accordance with the health and safety guidelines outlined in the State's reopening guidance, but this is a challenge for many school districts.
If a district can't meet the standards currently, these districts can begin the school year via remote-only instruction until they can meet health and safety standards. They must also submit a plan and timeline for when they can meet these standards.
Parents will have the option to choose all-remote learning for their children.
Many students will need a safe space to learn, even during periods of remote instruction as not all families can provide supervision during remote instruction days.
For this reason, the State is encouraging districts to open spaces (provided they can do so safely) or to partner with community organizations to create remote learning centers where students can continue their remote learning in a supervised environment.
Reopening Guidance for In-Person Instruction
The Department of Education has provided a School Reopening FAQ page with common questions about fall school reopening guidelines.
The reopening guidance describes several health and safety standards to be prioritized in school reopening, recognizing that flexibility is needed as each school will have unique needs and circumstances, and some efforts will need to be guided by local health officials:

Social distancing: Schools and districts must allow for social distancing within the classroom. If schools are not able to maintain this physical distance, additional modifications should be considered.
Face coverings: Students are required to wear face coverings at all times while inside a school building, regardless of social distancing, unless doing so would inhibit the individual's health. School staff and visitors are also required to wear face coverings. For more information, refer to DOE's guidance on face coverings.
Limited capacity: It is recommended that students and staff be seated at least six feet apart in class when practicable. When weather allows, windows should be opened to allow for greater air circulation.
Cleaning/disinfecting: Procedures must be implemented by each school district for the sanitization of school buildings and school buses. Increased handwashing measures are also important for students and staff.

Other provisions in the guidance include:

Cafeteria directors should consider staggering meal times to allow for social distancing; discontinuing self-serve or buffet lines; having students eat meals outside or in their classrooms; and requiring staff to disinfect eating areas between groups.
Recess should also be held in staggered shifts, with efforts to promote social distancing and hygiene protocols.
Cohorting: Schools may wish to identify small groups of students and keep them together (cohorting) to ensure that student and staff groupings are as static as possible, thereby limiting exposure to large groups of students.
School buses: If a district is providing transportation services on a school bus, a face covering must be worn by all students upon entering the bus unless doing so would inhibit the student's health. Operators should encourage social distancing. CDC guidelines recommend seating on a school bus such that there is one student seated per row, skipping a row between each child, if possible.

For full details, refer to the Department of Education's reopening page for reopening guidance, updates, and supplemental guidance.
For larger districts, the sheer number of students in a building may make it impractical for all students to be in their schools at once. For these districts, we are providing them with flexibility to rearrange their school schedules to allow for grouping -- or cohorting -- of students, or by implementing hybrid learning environments in which students receive both in-person and remote instruction.
Districts should share preliminary scheduling plans with staff, families, and students at least four weeks before the start of the school year in order to allow families to plan child care and work arrangements.
To assist with development and review of school reopening plans, the DOE has provided a Checklist for the Re-Opening of Schools.
Public Health Recommendations for School Reopening
Because reopening is dependent upon health data and informed by experts in the health field, districts will need to be prepared to pivot to remote instruction at any time during the 2020-2021 school year.
The Department of Health has released detailed health and safety guidance for local health departments to use in partnership with school districts.
This guidance uses a regional approach to determine risk within the broader school community and provides specific instructions regarding what to do in the event that a student or staff member becomes ill with COVID-19 or symptoms of COVID-19.
Every week, the Department of Health will provide information on COVID-19 transmission at the regional level, characterizing risk as low (green), moderate (yellow), high (orange), and very high (red).
When regions are in the very high-risk category (red), it is recommended that they implement fully remote learning.
Schools in other risk levels will consult with their local health departments as they work to implement protocols requiring staff and students to stay home when sick or if they have been in close contact with someone with COVID-19, develop a policy for daily symptom screening, and identify rapid testing resources when staff and students develop COVID-19 symptoms.
If a student tests positive for COVID-19, the places where the student spent significant time should be closed for 24 hours and then cleaned before they are put back in use. Districts must also report any known positives to the local health department, who will use a newly developed DOH Regional Risk Matrix to determine whether further steps—such as completely closing a school—are necessary.
Remote Learning Option
All districts must provide a remote learning option for parents or guardians who request it for their children.
The Department of Education has issued additional guidance for parents who choose full-time remote learning for their children in the 2020-2021 school year.
The core elements of the guidance include:

Universal eligibility: All students, including students who receive special education or related services, are eligible for full-time remote learning if their parent or guardian chooses.
Policies and procedures: School districts must set clear policies and procedures for families who want full-time remote learning for their children. School districts also need procedures for students in full-time remote learning to transition back to in-person services.
Communications: School districts must communicate clearly and frequently with families, in their home language, about the availability of this offering and the related procedures.
Quality of programming: Students participating in all-remote instruction should receive the same quality of instruction that is provided to any other student. In addition, full-time remote programs must adhere to the same policies and regulations that in-person and hybrid programs follow regarding student attendance and the length of the school day.
Data reporting: To help the Department evaluate fulltime remote learning, school districts will report data to the Department about student participation in these programs.

The full guidance is available on the Department of Education's "Restart and Recovery: The Road Back" webpage.
Closing The Digital Divide
To address "the digital divide" and ensure reliable internet connectivity and access to one-to-one digital devices for every student, New Jersey is:

Offering $10 million of the State's federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) funds to public school districts to purchase digital devices and internet connectivity for one-to-one student use – the Department of Education will release an application for districts;
Redirecting up to $44 million in Coronavirus Relief Fund (CRF) funds, with an additional $6 million available for nonpublic schools, to close any remaining gap and fill the unmet digital device and internet connectivity needs of New Jersey students.

2020 SUMMER PROGRAMS
As of July 6, school districts may hold in-person summer educational programs including extended school year and special education services so long as they follow the health and safety protocols outlined by the NJ Department of Health for Youth summer camps. For more details on these requirements, refer to this article.
School districts may decide the best way to meet their students' educational needs in a safe environment – whether it be in-person, remote, or hybrid.
In addition, the Department of Education has released guidance that will allow districts to provide robust programs in a safe environment, while preparing students for the school year ahead.
To learn more, refer to the Department of Education's Summer Learning Resource Guide and Guidance on the Delivery of Extended School Year Services.

Masks hide part of a person's face. Young children rely on faces. From the time
               they are babies, young children look at faces for the signals they need to feel safe.
When faces are partly hidden by masks, kids can't see the friendly smile or familiar
               look that usually puts them at ease. When kids can't see the person's whole face,
               it's harder to feel safe. It's natural to feel scared.
But slowly and gently, parents can help kids feel more comfortable. Even very young
               kids can learn that something that seemed too scary at first is not so scary after
               all. <SEP> Why Do Some Young Kids Feel Scared of Masks? <EOS>

To learn more about COVID-19-related scams and rumors, visit the COVID-19 Rumor Control and Disinformation site created by New Jersey law enforcement and various emergency preparedness entities.
Note: Violations of Executive Orders should still be reported at https://covid19.nj.gov/violation.
Unlawful activities include:
Excessive Third-Party Delivery Service Fees

A new law places limits on service fees charged to restaurants by third-party delivery apps and websites during the COVID-19 state of emergency.
Under the law, which is now in effect, third-party food takeout and delivery service apps and websites cannot charge service fees greater than 20 percent of the cost of the individual order or greater than 10 percent of the cost of the individual order, when the order is delivered by an employee of the restaurant or an independent contractor with whom the restaurant has contracted directly.

Price Gouging

New Jersey's law against price gouging is in effect, prohibiting excessive price increases during a declared state of emergency, or for 30 days after the termination of the state of emergency.
Excessive price increases are price increases more than 10 percent higher than the price at which merchandise was sold during the normal course of business prior to the state of emergency. See New Jersey's Consumer Fraud Act for more information.

Hoarding

Under a new federal law, individuals or businesses hoarding designated health and medical resources necessary to respond to the spread of COVID-19 that are scarce or the supply of which would be threatened by excessive accumulation will be subject to prosecution.
The State is also cracking down on any physician or pharmacist hoarding certain prescription drugs, or inappropriately prescribing them to friends. Administrative Order 2020-01 imposes state wide restrictions on prescribing and dispensing of drugs. This is to protect the supply of certain drugs being investigated for their potential in treating COVID-19. Violations can be reported to the State Board of Medical Examiners.

Common COVID-Related Scams

Contact Tracing scams: Scammers posing as contact tracers are attempting to steal private information. New Jersey contact tracers will never ask for your social security number or sensitive financial details like your bank or credit card number.
Treatment scams: Scammers are offering to sell fake cures, vaccines, and advice on unproven treatments for COVID-19.
Supply scams: Scammers are creating fake shops, websites, social media accounts, and email addresses claiming to sell medical supplies currently in high demand, such as surgical masks. When consumers attempt to purchase supplies through these channels, fraudsters pocket the money and never provide the promised supplies.
Provider scams: Scammers are also contacting people by phone and email, pretending to be doctors and hospitals that have treated a friend or relative for COVID-19, and demanding payment for that treatment.
Charity scams: Scammers are soliciting donations for individuals, groups, and areas affected by COVID-19.
Phishing scams: Scammers posing as national and global health authorities, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), are sending phishing emails designed to trick recipients into downloading malware or providing personal identifying and financial information.
App scams: Scammers are also creating and manipulating mobile apps designed to track the spread of COVID-19 to insert malware that will compromise users' devices and personal information.
Investment scams: Scammers are offering online promotions on various platforms, including social media, claiming that the products or services of publicly traded companies can prevent, detect, or cure COVID-19, and that the stock of these companies will dramatically increase in value as a result. These promotions are often styled as "research reports," make predictions of a specific "target price," and relate to microcap stocks, or low-priced stocks issued by the smallest of companies with limited publicly available information.

Tips on Avoiding COVID-19 Scams
The New Jersey COVID-19 Fraud Task Force, a joint federal-state effort to investigate and prosecute unlawful and misleading activities related to COVID-19, has provided several recommendations to avoid common COVID-19 related scams:

Independently verify the identity of any company, charity, or individual that contacts you regarding COVID-19.
Check the websites and email addresses offering information, products, or services related to COVID-19. Be aware that scammers often employ addresses that differ only slightly from those belonging to the entities they are impersonating. For example, they might use "cdc.com" or "cdc.org" instead of "cdc.gov."
Be wary of unsolicited emails offering information, supplies, or treatment for COVID-19 or requesting your personal information for medical purposes. Legitimate health authorities will not contact the general public this way.
Ignore offers for a COVID-19 vaccine, cure, or treatment. Remember, if there is a medical breakthrough, you won't hear about it for the first time through an email, online ad, or unsolicited sales pitch.
Research any charities or crowdfunding sites soliciting donations in connection with COVID- 19 before giving. Remember, an organization may not be legitimate even if it uses words like "CDC" or "government" in its name or has reputable looking seals or logos on its materials. For online resources on donating wisely, visit the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) website.

Schools should immediately notify the health authorities if a confirmed case is identified at the school.
When an individual tests positive for COVID-19, swift identification and management of those who have had contact with the case is necessary in order to intervene and interrupt further transmission.
This is achieved by:
Promptly identifying the contacts of a confirmed case of COVID-19.
Providing contacts with information on self-quarantine, proper hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette measures, and giving advice on what to do if they develop symptoms.
Performing laboratory tests in a timely manner to detect the virus in all contacts with symptoms, and those who are at high-risk of exposure.
Contact tracing should be conducted by local public health authorities, who will need to work closely with school authorities.
Contacts should be managed on the basis of exposure category, which includes quarantine for those at high-risk of exposure, as outlined in ECDC’s guidance on contact tracing.
Information should be given to parents about what symptoms to look out for in the children, as well as where to access medical advice. If symptoms occur in contacts they should immediately be isolated, given medical attention and tested. <SEP> 7. What should schools do when someone tests positive? <EOS>

As of late March 2020, the evidence suggests that having epilepsy does not typically increase your risk of (a) catching the virus and (b) having severe symptoms. People with epilepsy are not considered immunocompromised. Unless you have other health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, or issues with your lungs, you're not considered to be at an elevated risk. Regardless of that, it's important all the same to take extra preventative measures to protect yourself and your community.

You can. Transfusions are still needed for cases like organ transplants or complications of childbirth.
The American Red Cross is collecting donations at blood banks, which have enacted new safety measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Those measures include checking the temperatures of staff members and donors before they enter a drive facility, providing hand sanitizer for use before and during the donation process, enhancing their disinfection of surfaces and equipment, and spacing beds — when possible — to enable social distancing between donors.
And even if you’re under a stay-at-home order, donating blood is an essential need, so public health officials have made an exception for your trip to the center.

If you rely on public transportation, use caution. If you’re sick or live in an area where an outbreak has been reported, avoid it. 
Mass transit could increase your risk of exposure to coronavirus. Luckily, transit systems are upping their cleaning regimens — notably the New York subway system. 
Dr. Robyn Gershon, a professor of epidemiology at New York University’s School of Public Health, has some tips: When you ride a bus or subway, sneeze or cough into your elbow. Use a tissue to hold onto a pole. Avoid touching your face while you’re riding, and use hand sanitizer if you have it while you’re commuting. 
Again, wash your hands before, during and after your trip. 
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo recommends letting crowded trains or buses pass and waiting for a less crowded one. It’s nearly impossible to maintain 6 feet of distance on a packed subway car. 
If you have a chronic illness, find alternative means of transportation — being in a crowded subway car or bus will significantly increase your risk of infection. <SEP> Should I avoid public transportation? <EOS>
Because of close contact and the number of people in correctional and detention facilities (including prisons and jails), staff and people who are incarcerated are at greater risk for the spread of germs. To help your facility prepare for the possible spread of COVID-19, update your emergency operations plan. This includes:

Adding key COVID-19 prevention strategies and posting information in the facility on how to limit the spread of germs.
Reminding staff to stay home when sick.
Identifying points of contact for local public health agencies.
Identifying physical locations (dedicated housing areas and bathrooms) where you can medically isolate incarcerated persons, as well as where to quarantine known close contacts of people with COVID-19.

Follow guidance on medical isolation and quarantine.
Medical isolation and quarantine locations should be separate.


Offering flu shots to staff and people who are incarcerated, because limiting cases of flu can help speed the identification of people with COVID-19.
Developing ways to continue providing critical services, such as mental health support.
Ensuring adequate stocks of hygiene, cleaning, and medical supplies.

Hygiene: Soap (preferably liquid to promote use), tissues, and hand drying supplies, as well as hand sanitizers, when possible. Ensure no-cost access to soap.
Cleaning: EPA-registered disinfectantsexternal icon effective against the virus that causes COVID-19
Medical supplies: Supplies for daily clinic needs, personal protective equipment (PPE), and testing


Creating and testing communications plans to share critical information.
Setting up systems to safely transfer people between facilities and identifying alternative strategies to in-person court appearances, when possible.

Prevent confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases and their close contacts from being transferred between jurisdictions and facilities unless necessary for medical evaluation, medical isolation/quarantine, clinical care, extenuating security concerns, or to prevent overcrowding.


Planning for staff absenteeism.

Follow CDC guidance on recommended PPE for staff who will have direct contact with an individual with possible COVID-19 infection, or infectious materials. Make contingency plans for the likely event of PPE shortages.
Follow the CDC Interim Clinical Guidance for Management of Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) and monitor the guidance website regularly for updates for staff evaluating and providing care for confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases. When no on-site healthcare capacity is available, make a plan for how to ensure that people suspected to have COVID-19 will be medically isolated, evaluated, tested (if indicated), and provided medical care.

Source control is a term used to describe measures (e.g., cloth face coverings or face shields) intended to prevent people with COVID-19 from spreading the disease to others. COVID-19 is spread through droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. Evidence suggests that people who have mild symptoms or no symptoms can spread it to others without realizing they are infected. Cloth face coverings and face shields are types of source control that provide a barrier between droplets produced from a potentially infected person and other people, reducing the likelihood of transmitting the virus. <SEP> What does source control mean? <EOS>
You don't need to stockpile toilet paper in Western countries. The reason for the toilet paper over-buying has been fueled by online rumors related to people thinking they're liable to be quarantined in their houses for many months. If anyone is asked to self-isolate at home, the period is usually for 14 days, not months and you can still get deliveries of groceries. Why toilet paper has been disappearing off supermarket shelves relates more to social contagion: stories spread on social media and via telephone trees have been scaring people into panic buying and this has been causing others to fear they need to join in. Stockpiling is a way people gain a sense of control, comfort and security in having sufficient supplies at home when something unknown and scary happens. Staying calm and buying a normal supply of toilet paper is your best approach and will help the supermarket supply chains work as they should. <SEP> Why do I need to stockpile toilet paper? <EOS>

If you are at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, you should: stock up on supplies; take everyday precautions to keep space between yourself and others; when you go out in public, keep away from others who are sick; limit close contact and wash your hands often; and avoid crowds, cruise travel, and non-essential travel. If there is an outbreak in your community, stay home as much as possible. Watch for symptoms and emergency signs. If you get sick, stay home and call your doctor. More information on how to prepare, what to do if you get sick, and how communities and caregivers can support those at higher risk is available on People at Risk for Serious Illness from COVID-19.

 Yes.  The Governor’s latest executive order requires anyone over the age of 2 who can medically tolerate a face covering to cover their mouth and nose with a cloth face cover when in a public place and unable to maintain a safe distance (6 feet) from others. Essential businesses and manufacturers are required to provide face-coverings to all employees who are unable to maintain 6 feet of social distancing.
You could spread COVID-19 to others even if you do not feel sick. Everyone should wear a cloth face cover when they must go out in public, for example to the grocery store or to pick up other necessities.
​Cloth face coverings should not be placed on children under age 2, anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.
The cloth face cover is meant to protect other people in case you are infected.
Do NOT use a facemask meant for a health care worker.

A superspreader is someone who is really good at passing on the coronavirus to others. 
The good news is: they’re rare. 
But superspreaders exist. There was that Texas birthday party, where one man reportedly infected 17 members of his family. What about Biogen employees, who infected people after a healthcare conference? And there was that Connecticut soirée, dubbed “Party Zero.” 
Now researchers are trying to figure out why so few people spread the virus to so many. For the most part, they’re trying to answer three questions: Who are the superspreaders? When does superspreading take place? And where? 
The answer to these questions is, for the most part, unknown. As with everything coronavirus-related, assume the worst and be hypervigilant. <SEP> What are superspreaders? <EOS>
No. As each international mass gathering is different, the factors to consider when determining if the event should be cancelled may also differ. Any decision to change a planned international gathering should be based on a careful assessment of the risks and how they can be managed, and the level of event planning. The assessment should involve all stakeholders in the event, and in particular the health authorities in the country or community where the event is due to take place. These authorities and stakeholders are in the best position to assess the level of stress the event might place on the local health system and emergency services – and whether this level of stress is acceptable in the current situation. It is WHO’s view that all countries with community transmission should seriously consider postponing or reducing mass gatherings that bring people together and have the potential to amplify disease and support the recommended best practice of physical distancing. Any decision will be supported through the use of WHO tools, in particular the Risk Assessment for Mass Gatherings during COVID-19. If movement restrictions and further national measures have been established in the country, the WHO RA does not apply. However, when the process of re-opening/conducting mass gatherings is being considered post movement restrictions, it will be key to ensure any decisions are based on a risk assessment, such as the WHO Mass gatherings COVID-19 risk assessment. <SEP> Does WHO recommend that all international mass gatherings be cancelled because of COVID-19? <EOS>

Discussions with health department staff are confidential. This means that your personal and medical information will be kept private and only shared with those who may need to know, like your health care provider.
If you have been diagnosed with COVID-19, your name will not be shared with those you came in contact with. The health department will only notify people you were in close contact with (within 6 feet for more than 15 minutes) that they might have been exposed to COVID-19.

If you contract the virus, your response to it will depend on many factors, only one of which is taking medication that suppresses your immune system. In addition, stopping the medication on your own could cause your underlying condition to get worse. Most importantly, don't make this decision on your own. It's always best not to adjust the dose or stop taking a prescription medication without first talking to the doctor who prescribed the medication. <SEP> I'm taking a medication that suppresses my immune system. Should I stop taking it so I have less chance of getting sick from the coronavirus? <EOS>
This question is still being studied in-depth by the medical community, but the tentative answer right now is yes. Recently, a study in South Korea showed that asymptomatic carriers have just as much of the virus in their lungs, nose, and throat as symptomatic carriers do. Unfortunately, there are still a lot of unanswered questions in the scientific community about how often asymptomatic carriers spread the virus. <SEP> Are asymptomatic carriers contagious? <EOS>
You can’t, said Dr. James Phillips, chief of disaster and operational medicine at George Washington University Hospital.
“We’re so far behind on testing, there’s only one way we can be certain not to transmit the virus and be certain not to get it ourselves: We need to start treating every person as though they have this, ” Phillips said. 
“And everyone needs to treat us like we have it, and socially distance ourselves in that manner. Because until we have (enough) testing, we don’t know who has this. And we’re not sure when they start spreading it.” 
That’s why it’s so critical to avoid crowds, stay at least 6 feet away from others, wear a mask when you might be in close contact with others, wash or disinfect your hands, and stop touching your face. <SEP> If people can spread the virus without showing any symptoms, how can I tell who’s infected and who’s not? <EOS>
When assessing a person’s risk of exposure to COVID-19, close contact means being within 6 feet of a person with COVID-19 for at least 15 minutes or having exposure to the person’s respiratory secretions (for example, coughed or sneezed on; shared a drinking glass or utensils; kissing) while they were contagious. For example, briefly walking by someone with COVID-19 in a store is not considered close contact.
A person with COVID-19 is considered to be contagious starting from 2 days before they became sick (or 2 days before they tested positive if they never had symptoms) until they meet the criteria to discontinue isolation. <SEP> What does close contact mean? <EOS>
​No. <SEP> ​Is a pandemic safety officer a requirement for residential construction? <EOS>
People with COVID-19 who have stayed home (are home isolated) can stop home isolation under the following conditions. <SEP> If I have COVID-19, when can I end home isolation? <EOS>
If patient B was asymptomatic during the close contact with patient C, we would not recommend monitoring or restrictions on movement and travel on patient C. If patient C develops fever or other respiratory signs/symptoms, they should self-isolate, call their healthcare provider or healthcare facility before presenting to any facility, and inform them of their possible contact with contacts of a COVID-19 case. <SEP> How do I handle contacts to a contact of a diagnosed COVID-19 case? In other words, patient A has COVID-19.  Patient B has direct close contact with patient A, resulting in patient B being quarantined.  Patient C has direct close contact with patient B before patient B is quarantined. <EOS>
If you have asthma, or other underlying conditions, the COVID-19 can cause inflammation. If you feel you’re experiencing symptoms, contact your provider to be evaluated.
What’s the difference between allergies and COVID-19?
An allergy is a reaction by your immune system to something that doesn’t bother most other people (e.g. pollen, dust, mites, etc.). Allergies symptoms can include a runny nose, sneezing, itching, rashes, swelling, or asthma. COVID -19 is the disease caused by the corona virus. Symptoms include fever, coughing or sneezing, or difficulty breathing. As you can see, there are similar symptoms. If you don’t have a fever, it’s likely you may be suffering from allergies. <SEP> I have asthma, do I need to immediately go to the doctor if I get sick, show symptoms? <EOS>

Sales and Deliveries of Alcoholic Beverages and Cocktails
Holders of certain licenses and permit holders can sell alcoholic beverages for takeout or delivery.
Businesses with plenary retail consumption licenses, hotel or motel licenses, seasonal retail consumption licenses, or concessionaire permits, generally issued to bars and restaurants, are permitted to sell and deliver alcoholic beverages in original containers or in closed and sealed containers and mixed cocktails in closed and sealed containers for consumption off the licensed premises.
Craft distillery licensees can sell distilled alcoholic beverages that are manufactured on the licensed premises and mixed or blended with other alcoholic or nonalcoholic beverages and sold in closed and sealed containers for consumption off the licensed premises. Craft distilleries can also sell distilled alcoholic beverages in original containers accompanied by one or more nonalcoholic beverages or food stuffs that may be combined by the consumer to prepare a mixed drink.
Deliveries from Microbreweries
Microbreweries are allowed to conduct home deliveries to their customers.
The Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control previously enforced a ruling prohibiting home delivery. As of March 30, the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control has decided to relax this ruling allowing microbreweries to conduct home deliveries.

Coronavirus can stick to hair, said Dr. David Aronoff, director of the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. 
Touching contaminated hair and then touching your mouth, eyes or nose could increase your risk of infection. “Like on the skin, this coronavirus is a transient hitchhiker that can be removed by washing,” Aronoff said.
But that doesn’t mean you have to wash the hair on your head multiple times a day, said dermatologist Dr. Hadley King. 
That’s because “living hair attached to our scalps may be better protected by our natural oils that have some antimicrobial properties and may limit how well microbes can attach to the hair,” she said. 
“If you are going out into areas that could possibly be contaminated with viral particles, then it would be reasonable to wash the hair daily during the pandemic. But it’s not the same as hand washing – the virus infects us through our mucosal surfaces.  If your hair is not falling into your face or you’re not running your fingers through it, then there is less of a risk.”
If your hair does fall into your face, you may want to pull it back to minimize your risk, King said.
As for facial hair, “washing at least daily if not more frequently is wise, depending on how often they touch their face,” Aronoff said. <SEP> Can coronavirus stay in my hair or in a beard? Should I wash my hair every day? <EOS>

Helping children understand and follow recommendations, like social distancing and wearing cloth face coverings, can be challenging if your child has intellectual disabilities, sensory issues, or other special healthcare needs. Keeping children at home and sheltering in place can lower stress created by social distancing and cloth face covering recommendations. Reach out to others for help in running essential errands.
Behavioral techniques can be used to address behavioral challenges and to develop new routines. These include social stories, video modeling, picture schedules, and visual cues. Try rewarding your child in small ways with his or her favorite non-food treat or activities to help switch routines and to follow recommendations.
Many of the organizations you turn to for information and support around your child’s complex, chronic medical condition may have information on their websites to help families address issues related to COVID-19. Your child’s therapist(s) and/or teachers may also have resources to help successfully introduce new routines to your child.

The COVID-19 pandemic has put unprecedented strain on the public health data supply chain. In many states, the large number of COVID-19 cases has severely strained the ability of hospitals, healthcare providers, and laboratories to report cases with complete demographic information, such as race and ethnicity. The unprecedented volume of cases has also limited the ability of state and local health departments to conduct thorough case investigations and collect all requested case data. As a result, many COVID-19 case notifications submitted to CDC do not have complete information on patient demographics, clinical outcomes, exposures, and factors that may put people at higher risk for severe disease.
National case surveillance data are constantly changing. For instance, as new information is gathered about previously reported cases, health departments provide updated data to CDC. As more information and data become available, analyses might find changes in surveillance data and trends during a previously reported time window.
A key challenge with case reporting is that people who are infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 may have mild or no symptoms. These people might not have sought testing or health care and are, therefore, less likely to have a reported case. Similarly, cases in people who have had severe outcomes, such as hospitalizations, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, and deaths, are more likely to be reported than cases in people with less severe illnesses. These challenges result in limitations when analyzing and interpreting the data. <SEP> What are some of the challenges with national case surveillance for COVID-19? <EOS>

Think about a bar. Alcohol is flowing. It can be loud, but it’s definitely intimate, and you often need to lean in close to hear your friend. And strangers have way, way fewer reservations about coming up to people in a bar. That’s sort of the point of a bar. Feeling good and close to strangers. 
It’s no surprise, then, that bars have been linked to outbreaks in several states. Louisiana health officials have tied at least 100 coronavirus cases to bars in the Tigerland nightlife district in Baton Rouge. Minnesota has traced 328 recent cases to bars across the state. In Idaho, health officials shut down bars in Ada County after reporting clusters of infections among young adults who had visited several bars in downtown Boise.
Governors in California, Texas and Arizona, where coronavirus cases are soaring, have ordered hundreds of newly reopened bars to shut down. Less than two weeks after Colorado’s bars reopened at limited capacity, Gov. Jared Polis ordered them to close.
To understand the connection between bars and outbreaks, consider a simple question:  Are you your most vigilant self after a few drinks? <SEP> Why are bars linked to outbreaks? <EOS>
Yes, they should. If your child is younger than 2 years old, they aren’t required to wear a face mask. Some younger children may also have a hard time keeping a face mask on, so you can prioritize putting it on them when you’re around other people (like at the store or during school dropoff), then take it off when you’re away from others. Even if your child is young, you can explain the importance of wearing a face mask to keep others safe. If they know why they’re wearing it, they may be more likely to keep it on. <SEP> Should my child wear a mask? <EOS>
Early studies report children of all ages are at risk for COVID-19; however, complications of COVID-19 appear to be less common among children compared with adults based on limited reports from China and the United States. Based on limited data on children with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, infants (<12 months of age) may be at higher risk of severe or critical disease compared with older children, with hospitalization being most common among children aged <1 year and those with underlying conditions, such as chronic lung disease (including asthma), cardiovascular disease, and immunosuppression.

Upon entering a structure (home or place of business) where someone has died and COVID-19 is a suspected cause or contributing factor, law enforcement personnel should anticipate that others in that building could also be infected. If the cause of death is unknown, it would be most protective to assume that COVID-19 contributed. Law enforcement personnel should limit the number of personnel needed to enter the building, if feasible. If the building has not been cleared, law enforcement personnel should wear the following PPE:

A single pair of disposable examination gloves
Disposable isolation gown or single use coveralls
Fit-tested NIOSH approved N95 respirator or higher level of protection (or a facemask if respirators are unavailable)
Eye protection (goggles or a disposable face shield).

Further, law enforcement personnel should try to maintain social distancing (at least 6 feet distance) with others at all times, especially while in the structure.
If the building has been cleared, then it may not be necessary to wear respiratory and eye protection, unless there are other hazards present that dictate their use according to an onsite hazard/risk assessment.
Law enforcement personnel should be careful not to touch potentially contaminated surfaces and then touch their eyes, nose, or mouth. However, this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
Law enforcement should avoid direct contact with someone who has died of suspected or confirmed COVID-19:

Every jurisdiction is different, but law enforcement personnel, in general, should not move or transport a body.
Consult with the medical examiner/coroner’s office to determine the appropriate next steps and protective measures for that jurisdiction. The medical examiner/coroner’s office can decide who will transport the decedent.

When the investigation is over, law enforcement personnel should take the following steps:

Safely remove gloves and other PPE and properly dispose of them according to existing policies and procedures. Law enforcement personnel should be trained on the proper donning and doffing of PPEpdf icon.
Wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or, if soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
If other reusable items (e.g., such as duty belt or gear) come into contact with individuals with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, disinfect those items according to the manufacturers’ instructions. For disinfection, most EPA-registered household disinfectants should be effective. A list of products that are EPA-approved for use against the virus that causes COVID-19 is available hereexternal icon. <SEP> Are there additional precautions law enforcement personnel should take during death investigations? <EOS>
 In order to reduce reporting burdens for testing facilities and ensure that the core COVID-19 related test data is accurate and meaningful, pre-harmonized terminology standards -- LOINC and SNOMED-CT codes -- are available. Using this basic and simple approach to ensuring the same test is described the same way can help establish infrastructure needed to accomplish our mission of protecting and promoting public health.
Testing facilities' use of LOINC and SNOMED-CT terminology standards, when available, should help improve the accuracy of reporting of their SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 related test results. As noted on the CDC's Reporting COVID-19 Laboratory Data page, standard use of these laboratory terminology codes ensures that the same type of test is represented uniformly across the United States.
For IVD tests, LOINC codes can be used to represent the "question" a diagnostic test asks of a specimen (e.g., does this specimen have SARS-CoV-2 RNA?), and SNOMED-CT codes can be used to represent the diagnostic "answer" (e.g., SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected).

We are still learning about this virus and how it spreads, but it appears it can spread from humans to animals in some situations. CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19. Most of these animals had contact with a person with COVID-19. A tiger at a New York zoo has also tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19.
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. Based on the limited data available, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person, typically through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking.
People sick with COVID-19 should isolate themselves from other people and animals, including pets, during their illness until we know more about how this virus affects animals. If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wear a mask and wash your hands before and after you interact with pets. <SEP> Should I worry about my pet cat? <EOS>

The numbers of deaths due to COVID-19 and deaths among people with COVID-19 should not be added together to determine a total death count. They are from separate data sources.
The numbers of deaths due to COVID-19 and deaths among people with COVID-19 are reported from two different systems that are updated on different timelines. These numbers cannot be compared day-to-day to determine how many deaths have occurred in each category.
The number of deaths due to COVID-19 are not necessarily included in the number of deaths among people with COVID-19. After review, at either the state or national level, some deaths may not be counted as COVID-19 deaths. This is rare, and the expectation is that in the end the numbers will closely align. 
The deaths due to COVID-19 are provisional counts and often track several weeks behind other data. The number reported indicates the number of deaths from records that have been analyzed as of the date indicated. However, due to the one- to eight-week timeframe it can take to completely process death records, counts from previous weeks are continually revised as more records are received and processed.

Fewer children seem to get infected by the coronavirus than adults, and their symptoms tend to be mild. But it can be serious, contrary to earlier belief.
A very small number of children with the virus have shown symptoms associated with toxic shock or Kawasaki disease. This is a rare illness in children, according to the New York City health department, that involves inflammation of the blood vessels, including coronary arteries.
Two studies offer compelling evidence that children can transmit the virus. While neither proved it, many epidemiologists who were not involved in the research said that the evidence was strong enough to suggest that schools should be kept closed. (We have more about schools in a later section.)

COVID-19 has devastated long-term care facilities and nursing homes in New Jersey and across the nation. In an effort to protect the lives of residents and staff at these facilities, the State has taken a number aggressive measures including:

Curtailing visitation on March 14, and requiring screening for symptoms and temperature checks of all individuals who enter the facilities
Developing a comprehensive testing plan for residents and staff; baseline testing was completed for all residents and staff by the end of May and retesting continues for residents and staff who have tested negative; as of August 10, more than 310,000 tests have been completed on residents and 495,000 tests for staff
In partnership with the VA, universal baseline testing of all residents and staff has been completed at all three veterans memorial homes – Paramus, Menlo Park, and Vineland
The positivity rate for long-term care residents has been reduced from 6% in May to less than 1% in July, and the positivity rate for staff has fallen from 3% in May to less than 1% in July
Increasing the personal protective equipment (PPE) available to these facilities; as of July 22, the State has distributed more than 30 million pieces of PPE to long term care facilities
Allowing facilities to hire out-of-state, certified nurse aides to support staffing vacancies
Enforcing mandatory notification of residents, families and staff of an outbreak in their facilities, and requiring universal masking
Prohibiting admissions to facilities that could not cohort patients and staff
Deploying over 300 New Jersey National Guard members to long-term care facilities to provide additional staffing and support
Deploying an additional 40 VA clinical staff to New Jersey as part of strike force teams to help at our long-term care centers
Requiring facilities to confirm mandated updates to their outbreak prevention plans

Governor Murphy has announced a series of recommendations and actions from Manatt Health's review of New Jersey's long-term centers. Manatt Health provided several recommendations to improve quality, safety, and resilience within New Jersey's long-term care system.
New Jersey has implemented several key recommendations, including clearing more than 3,600 backlogged complaints, completing and publicly posting infection control surveys from nearly 470 facilities, and setting up a central Long-Term Care Emergency Operations Center.
The Department of Health has also announced a directive that sets mandatory benchmarks for New Jersey's long-term care facilities as they look to reopen to visitors and resume normal operations. The directive will also establish strong baseline infection-control measures, as well as requirements for PPE stockpiling and resident and staff testing – including weekly coronavirus tests for all staff. For more details, refer to Executive Directive No. 20-026.
To support long-term care facilities, the Governor announced the State is preparing to commit a total of $155 million dollars in state and federal funds to bolster staff testing programs, increase wages, and meet the more-stringent criteria for reopening that are being put in place.
Meanwhile, in response to the significant number of deaths and disturbing complaints about these facilities, on April 16, the New Jersey Attorney General's Office opened an investigation into the state's long-term care facilities.

In cases where a regulated entity believes it cannot meet certain obligations without endangering the health and welfare of employees or others as a result of complications from the COVID-19 pandemic, the agency will make case-by-case determinations on temporary alterations to reporting or compliance requirements.
Requests for temporary deviation from regulations and permit requirements may be made through a designated email address provided to all regulated entities: EGLE-EnforcementDiscretion@mi.gov. They will be asked to answer a series of questions, providing detailed information and specific rationale on the necessity of altering their obligation, after which a determination will be made. First priority must always be given to protecting human health and the environment.

The virus which causes COVID-19 is thought to be mostly spread by respiratory droplets released when people talk, cough or sneeze. Many people with COVID-19 do not show any symptoms but can still spread the virus to others, especially those who have had prolonged close contact with another person. Additionally, people can be contagious before they show symptoms of COVID-19. Wearing a face covering will help to protect the people around you if you are infected and do not know it. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend that people should wear a face covering in public to limit the spread of respiratory droplets, especially in situations where social distancing is hard to maintain. Face coverings along with other measures like good hand hygiene and social distancing work together to slow the spread. <SEP> How do face coverings slow the spread of COVID-19? <EOS>
You’ll want to focus on your wrists and forearms, your shoulders, and your chest and back. Read here for three stretches that’ll help, but for now let’s try this one for your wrists:
* Stand with one arm out in front of you and your palm facing the ground.
* With your other hand, gently pull the fingers of the outstretched arm back. You should feel the stretch in the underside of your wrist.
* Hold for a moment or two, then release.
* Next, keeping your arm straight, use your other hand to push your fingers and palm down and toward your body. Hold a few seconds, then release.
* Repeat with your other arm.
Don’t forget to stretch and strengthen your whole body, too. See The Times’s 9-Minute Strength Workout, which includes exercises you can do in a pinch. <SEP> I’m working at home and stiff as heck. Tips? <EOS>

All possible risks for safety and health should be assessed, such as risks resulting from reduced maintenance of machines and facilities during the closure period.  If a return to work is rushed and not done in a phased and cautious manner, it puts lives at risk, and threatens to undermine efforts to restore social and economic activity. <SEP> Can the return to the workplace be immediate after public measures are lifted? <EOS>
Coronaviruses appear to spread from person-to-person through respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important always to wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day, wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen temperatures.  More information on food and COVID-19 can be found on CDC’s website. <SEP> Should I be worried about people touching items at grocery stores? Can the virus be spread through food, including refrigerated or frozen food? <EOS>
If you're in short supply of food and supplies, and think that going for groceries is an absolute need, you can go. But keep in mind to take appropriate precautions, wear a cloth face covering, use hand sanitizer if you touch surfaces, and maintain as much social distancing as possible. Also, try to make a list upfront and spend less time wandering around in the store. Additionally, think about stocking up some supplies so that you can reduce the number of trips over time.
If you believe you might be at a higher risk, consider asking a neighbor/community helper and/or relative to run to the store for you. Given the fact that COVID-19 has been proven to be especially dangerous for seniors with weak immune systems, it is highly recommended to avoid groups of seniors.

The IACUC is responsible for ensuring the judicious use of animals in research, testing, and instructional activities. The total number of animals requested for each animal activity should be an estimate, based on sound judgement, that is needed to accomplish the proposed research goals. An increase in previously approved animal numbers (PHS Policy IV.D.1.a.) is a significant change that may be handled administratively if there is an existing IACUC-approved policy with clearly defined limits [see NOT-OD-14-126 and Lab Animal 2015: 44(3)].
IACUCs have the discretion to implement temporary changes to an existing IACUC-approved policy to allow increases in previously approved animal numbers due to the pandemic’s impact on ongoing research. Specifically, for the purpose of the COVID-19 pandemic, the IACUC may adjust:

the total numbers of animals allowed, or
the percentage increase from the originally approved protocol.

However, the study objectives must remain unchanged, and the original rationale for the number of animals to be used must support the requested change.
There is no need to notify OLAW or request a waiver for the implementation of such temporary changes to your institution’s policy. Such changes should be documented in your institution’s disaster or emergency preparedness plan, and institutions must ensure that the IACUC approves the proposed temporary changes prior to implementation. Grantees may contact the NIH awarding Institute/Center to request administrative supplements for unanticipated costs. Prior approval for any necessary rebudgeting is required only if the rebudgeting constitutes a change in scope.
Institutions, as always, should appropriately monitor and document the number of animals acquired (even those not yet used), for IACUC-approved activities. Monitoring should account for all animals, including those euthanized as a last resort during the COVID-19 pandemic. As alternatives to the administrative handling process described above, IACUCs may review and approve requests for the addition of replacement animals either by Full Committee Review (FCR) or Designated Member Review (DMR). <SEP> 20.

On July 13, the State Health Officer ordered the statewide closure of both indoor and outdoor
        operations of bars, brewpubs, breweries, and pubs, subject to specific exceptions. The State Health
    Officer also ordered the statewide closure of indoor operations of dine-in restaurants, wineries
    and tasting rooms, movie theaters, family entertainment centers, zoos and museums, and cardrooms. Finally, on July
    13, for Santa Clara County (and other counties on the State’s monitoring ), the State ordered the closure of
    indoor operations of gyms and fitness centers, places of worship, offices for non-critical
        infrastructure
        sectors, personal care services, and shopping malls.
Separately, under Section 13 of the local Health Officer Order issued July 2, the following businesses and activities
    must stay closed to the public because they create a particularly high risk of COVID-19 transmission:

Any indoor facility that is used for an activity inherently necessitating the removal of a face covering,
        including but not limited to indoor dining, indoor bars, indoor swimming pools, smoking lounges, saunas, steam
        rooms, and heated exercise studios. This prohibition does not apply to healthcare facilities. 
Professional sports stadiums and arenas, except that professional sports training is permitted and professional
        sporting events can occur in such facilities without spectators
        and in accordance with other applicable
        requirements, upon approval by the Health Officer of a facility-specific risk reduction protocol.
Non-residential adult and elder day care facilities.
Amusement and theme parks.
Nightclubs, music and concert venues, and indoor theaters.
Indoor playgrounds and amusement centers such as bounce centers, ball pits, and laser tag.

Doctors say wearing eye protection (in addition to face masks) could certainly help some people, but it’s not necessary for everyone.
Teachers who have younger students in the classroom are “likely to be in environments where children might pull down their masks, or not be very compliant with them,” epidemiologist Saskia Popescu said. “There is concern that you could get respiratory droplets in the eyes.”
If you’re a health care worker or taking care of someone at home who has coronavirus, it’s smart to wear eye protection, said Dr. Thomas Steinemann, clinical spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology.
(Note: Regular glasses or sunglasses aren’t enough, because they leave too many gaps around the eyes.)
But if you’re not in a high-risk situation — and you’re very strict about wearing face masks and staying 6 feet away from others – wearing goggles isn’t necessary.
While it’s still possible to get Covid-19 through the eyes, that scenario is less likely than getting it through your nose or mouth, Steinemann said.
He said if a significant number of people were getting coronavirus through their eyes, doctors would probably see more Covid-19 patients with conjunctivitis, also known as pink eye (though having pink eye doesn’t necessarily mean you have coronavirus). <SEP> I heard you can get Covid-19 through your eyes.

The VDH Division of Pharmacy Services is responsible for receiving, storing, and distributing this remdesivir, along with any future shipments of the drug, in accordance to an appropriate distribution plan, taking into account community-level needs and the limited supply with input from the Virginia Emergency Support Team Unified Command, Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association (VHHA) and the Governor’s office.
VDH is working with the VHHA to identify hospitals that are able to use medication doses provided in accordance with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorization issued on May 1st. The distribution of the initial remdesivir to acute care hospitals will be determined by a random selection model (lottery system) based on confirmed COVID-19 positive patients and a hospital’s ability to support the clinical use of remdesivir as confirmed by an attestation form back to the state.  Since Inova Health System received an initial supply directly from HHS, they were not included in the lottery to receive further medications from the state’s initial disbursement, but will be included in future disbursements by the state.

Currently, there is no evidence that you can get infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 by eating food, including wild hunted game meat. However, hunters can get infected with other diseases when processing or eating game.  Hunters should always practice good hygiene when processing animals by following these food safety recommendations:

Do not harvest animals that appear sick or are found dead.
Keep game meat clean and cool the meat down as soon as possible after harvesting the animal.
Avoid cutting through the backbone and spinal tissues and do not eat the brains of any wild animal.
When handling and cleaning game:

Wear rubber or disposable gloves.
Do not eat, drink, or smoke.


When finished handling and cleaning game:

Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.
Clean knives, equipment, and surfaces that were in contact with game meat with soap and water and then disinfect them. While these recommendations apply to general food safety practices, if you are concerned about COVID-19, you may use a product on the EPA list of disinfectants for use against the COVID-19 virusexternal icon.


Cook all game meat thoroughly (to an internal temperature of 165°F or higher).

Yes, so long as ceremonies and receptions comply with the limits on gatherings and other safety guidelines.
At this time, indoor wedding ceremonies may be held so long as they comply with the limits on gatherings. All attendees at indoor gatherings must wear face coverings and stay six feet apart.
However, indoor wedding receptions may not be held and indoor wedding venues, indoor catering halls, and indoor banquet halls remain closed in New Jersey.
See below for more details on ceremonies, venues, and marriage licenses.
To save lives and stop the spread of COVID-19, wear a mask, wash your hands, practice social distancing, and stay home if you are sick. Face coverings are required in indoor public spaces and in outdoor public spaces when social distancing is difficult to maintain.
WEDDING CEREMONIES AND VENUES
Outdoor wedding ceremonies and receptions may be held so long as they comply with the limits on outdoor gatherings, which limits events to 500 people at one time, and social distancing must be practiced.
Indoor wedding ceremonies may be held so long as they comply with the limits on indoor gatherings. Weddings, funerals, memorial services, and religious and political activities protected under the First Amendment must be limited to 100 people or 25% of a room's capacity -- whichever number is lower. All attendees at indoor gatherings must wear face coverings and stay six feet apart.
However, to save lives and prevent the further spread of COVID-19, indoor wedding receptions may not be held at this time, and indoor wedding venues, indoor catering halls, and indoor banquet halls remain closed in New Jersey along with all indoor dining.
Unfortunately, dance floors at all venues are closed due to the high-risk of spreading COVID-19 in these spaces, where many individuals may be in close contact with one another.
Safety Tips For Gatherings
During this difficult time, we understand everyone wants to spend time with family and friends. To ensure we don't inadvertently spread COVID-19 and needlessly put our loved ones at risk, the NJ Department of Health has offered some safety tips that can help reduce the risk of transmission when we gather in-person.

Remind invited guests to stay home if they have been exposed to the virus in the last 14 days, are showing COVID-19 symptoms, or recently travelled to an area or a state with high COVID-19 infection rates.
Ask guests to wear face coverings when they cannot social distance.
Make hand sanitizer available for guests.
Limit the number of people handling or serving food—for example, consider identifying one person to serve all food so that multiple people are not handling the serving utensils.
Remind guests to wash their hands before serving or eating food.
Use single-use hand towels or paper towels for drying hands so guests do not share a towel.
Clean and disinfect commonly touched surfaces and any shared items between use when feasible.
Consider keeping a list of guests who attended for potential future contract tracing needs. If you are called by a contact tracer, it's critical that you answer the call to protect us all. Your help is the key to stopping the spread of COVID-19 and saving lives.

MARRIAGE LICENSES
Those seeking a marriage license should apply for one in the New Jersey municipality where either party resides. The license is valid throughout New Jersey.
However, due to the public health emergency, please contact your local registrar first to determine if they are still open for business at this time as they may be closed to protect the health of residents and workers against COVID-19.
The Governor has also announced an executive order that allows individuals to use videoconferencing technology for the licensing process and the marriage ceremony.
The requirement that a marriage or civil union be solemnized in the physical presence of an officiant and two witnesses can be satisfied through the use of live audio-visual technology, provided certain conditions are met.
The order also suspends the 72-hour waiting period between the license application and issuance, extends the period that a license is valid from 30 to 90 days, and waives fees imposed for the issuance of a second marriage or civil union license if the original has expired.
For more information, contact your local registrar.

Possibly. In addition to spreading by respiratory droplets, smaller particles containing the coronavirus might linger in the air for longer periods of time. Scientific evidence suggests that small viral particles may remain aloft in the air for several hours under experimental conditions. People often catch COVID-19 after being indoors, close to infected people who may or may not have symptoms. All of this suggests that there may be an airborne component to the transmission of this virus.  The possibility of the coronavirus being contagious through the air is why it is so important to wear masks at all times, except when you are at home with your family. Masks prevent respiratory droplets from spreading, not only when you cough and sneeze, but also when you are talking, singing or exercising. <SEP> Is the coronavirus spread by the airborne route? <EOS>
According to the CDC, we do not currently know if pregnant women have a greater chance of getting sick from COVID-19 than the general public nor whether they are more likely to have serious illness as a result.

Yes, you are able to meet indoors in groups of up to two households (anyone in your support bubble counts as one household). This includes inviting people from one household into your home or visiting the home of someone else with members of your own household. You should continue to maintain social distancing with anyone you do not live with or who is not in your support bubble when doing so.
If you are in a support bubble you can continue to see each other without needing to maintain social distancing.
The more people you have interactions with, the more chance the virus has to spread. Therefore, try to limit the number of people you see – especially over short periods of time. The risk of transmission is also higher indoors, so you should take extra care to stay as safe as possible. <SEP> 2.1 Can I visit people indoors? <EOS>

On April 18, 2020, FDA announced that four antibody tests had received FDA Emergency Use Authorization for clinical laboratory use (FDA statement dated April 18.)  On May 13, 2020, FDA provided information on EUA Authorized Serology Test Performance for a total of thirteen antibody tests. This website is updated as additional tests receive EUA authorization. FDA estimates specificity, sensitivity, negative predictive value and positive predictive value for all current authorized tests. These tests are NOT intended to diagnose COVID-19.
It is not known if the antibodies that result from SARS-CoV-2 infection will provide someone with immunity from future infection. CDC scientists are conducting studies to better understand the level of antibodies needed for protection, the duration of that protection, and the factors associated with whether a person develops a protective antibody response. More information on serology testing can be found in CDC’s document Serology Testing for COVID-19 and at the VDH COVID-19 Testing site.
On April 7, FDA issued a statement about COVID-19 serological tests.  As FDA noted, “over 70 test developers have notified the agency that they have serological tests available for use. However, some firms are falsely claiming that their serological tests are FDA approved or authorized, or falsely claiming that they can diagnose COVID-19.

New Jersey has an online application and screening tool, NJHelps, that can be used to see if you are eligible for food assistance (SNAP), cash assistance (WFNJ/TANF or WFNJ/GA), and health Insurance (NJ FamilyCare/Medicaid). From there, you can apply for services or learn about additional resources.
To learn more about how to apply for affordable health coverage, visit http://www.njfamilycare.org/default.aspx.
To learn more about NJ SNAP and apply for help buying groceries, you can also visit, https://www.nj.gov/humanservices/njsnap/.
To apply for support through the NJ WIC Program (Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children), applicants can visit https://nj.gov/health/fhs/wic/participants/find-wic and contact their local WIC office by phone. During the coronavirus outbreak, new applicants will be assessed, certified and issued benefits remotely.
SNAP UPDATES
Simplified Application Process: During this public health crisis, the State has made the application process for SNAP food assistance simpler. For example, a hard copy signature for your application and an interview are no longer required to apply for SNAP during this emergency.
Through a new online tool, available on NJOneApp, SNAP applicants can upload the documentation needed for applications electronically instead of mailing or dropping off documents to the county enrollment offices.
You can also apply online at NJHelps.org or if you do not have a computer, you can apply by phone by calling your local board of social services. You can also download the application and mail it into the local board of social services.
Extra SNAP Benefit: Eligible SNAP recipients will receive an extra SNAP benefit. The amount you receive will be the difference between your regular SNAP benefit and the maximum benefit for your family size. If you already receive the maximum benefit, you will not be eligible for this extra payment. The State distributed over $180 million in additional SNAP benefits from March to July, and will distribute an estimated $38.5 million in August.
Extra Benefits for Children: Special Pandemic-EBT benefits will be provided to recipients of SNAP with children who normally receive free or reduced-price school meals. Families will receive $416.10 for each eligible student for nutritional support during the time that schools have been closed during the pandemic. No application is necessary. The majority of Pandemic-EBT eligible families participating in SNAP will receive the benefit on their household's existing Families First card on July 8. All other Pandemic-EBT eligible households will be mailed a P-EBT card beginning the week of July 6th and should expect to receive their card in the mail starting the week of July 13th.
SNAP Work Activities: During the current public health crisis, your case will not be closed if you are unable to participate in a work activity.
SNAP Recertification Extension: If your case is due to be recertified in March, April, May, June, July, or August and you are unable to get your paperwork in or complete your interview, your case will not be closed. You will receive your benefits on the usual day. Your case has been granted a six-month extension from the date your recertification is due. More information will follow on your new recertification date. In the meantime, you will continue to receive SNAP benefits.
Online Grocery Shopping: New Jerseyans enrolled in SNAP may use their Families First EBT card to purchase eligible groceries online through Amazon, Walmart, ShopRite, and The Fresh Grocer. Under federal rules, SNAP benefits cannot be used to pay for delivery fees. Recipients can register their EBT card with Amazon at Amazon.com/SNAP. To learn more about their SNAP programs, visit Walmart, Shoprite, or The Fresh Grocer.
WOMEN, INFANTS, AND CHILDREN (WIC) UPDATES
In light of COVID-19, New Jersey WIC has made several important changes to better serve residents:

New participants can apply for WIC services remotely by visiting: wic.nj.gov/ParticipantPortal/, there is no need to be physically present at an WIC agency.
Current participants can continue to receive benefits by having 3 months' worth of checks mailed to their homes.
Participants who are quarantined and unable to leave their homes to purchase foods, can designate an emergency proxy who can cash their checks at a store on their behalf.
Food choices have been expanded, giving participants more flexibility in the brand and size of foods they buy at the store. For more information, visit the NJ WIC website or check out their flyer.
The State is working closely with their infant formula contractor to ensure formula supplies are fully stocked at stores.
The State is also working closely with their authorized stores to ensure that limits placed on certain food items to customers are not placed on WIC participants.
The State has modified WIC's farmers' markets program, allowing participants to receive their vouchers primarily by mail, unless a pickup arrangement can be set up safely. Participants can also designate a proxy to pick up their produce from the markets for them.

WORK FIRST NEW JERSEY (WFNJ) UPDATES
WFNJ Recertification Extension: If your case is due in March, April, or May to be recertified, the deadline has been extended 60 days. More information will follow on your new recertification date. In the meantime, you will continue to receive WFNJ benefits.
WFNJ Work Activities: During the current public health crisis, your case will not be closed if you are unable to participate in a work activity. This includes if you are a General Assistance (GA) client completing the 28-day work activity while your case is being reviewed.

Anyone who had prolonged close contact (within 6 feet for at least 15 minutes) should be considered potentially exposed.  The use of a facemask for source control and adherence to other recommended infection prevention and control (IPC) measures (e.g., hand hygiene) by the provider help to reduce the risk of transmission or severe illness. In areas with moderate to substantial community transmission, patients are already at risk for exposure to SARS-CoV-2 due to exposures outside their home and should be alert to the development of signs or symptoms consistent with COVID-19.
The following should be considered when determining which patients are at higher risk for transmission and might be prioritized for evaluation and testing:

Facemask use by the patient – Mirroring the risk assessment guidance for healthcare personnel, patients not wearing a facemask would likely be at higher risk for infection compared to those that were wearing a facemask.
Type of interaction that occurred between the patient and infected provider – An interaction involving manipulation or prolonged close contact with the patient’s eyes, nose, or mouth (e.g., dental cleaning) likely poses higher risk of transmission to the patient compared to other interactions (e.g., blood pressure check).
PPE used by infected HCP – HCP wearing a facemask (or respirator) and face shield that extends down below the chin might have had better source control than wearing only a facemask. Note that respirators with exhalation valves might not provide source control.
Current status of patient – Is the patient currently admitted to a hospital or long-term care facility?  These individuals, if infected, can be at higher risk for severe illness and have the potential to expose large numbers of individuals at risk for severe disease. <SEP> A healthcare provider in our facility worked while infected with SARS-CoV-2. However, the provider wore a facemask at all times while interacting with patients. Are the patients at risk for SARS-CoV-2 and should they be notified? <EOS>
By staying home and only going out into public for essential activities, such as grocery shopping or picking up medications, you will minimize your exposure to COVID-19, and fewer exposed people means fewer cases of the disease. At this time, slowing the rate of infection, or flattening the curve, remains very important. Flattening the curve means fewer people are sick all at the same time. This helps our hospitals from becoming overrun and unable to treat everyone who needs care. <SEP> Does staying home really help prevent the spread of COVID-19? <EOS>
I don't think that the stimulus coming from Washington, however big, is going to solve this problem. It’s not going to be structured in a way that's most helpful to local governments. We'll probably see something, but not enough to fix the full problem. 
To the extent that stimulus helps states—where state bond banks can step in, for example, and make capital available to small businesses—it might enable you to take a small breath but won’t give you many more tools. You have to position yourselves in the hope that we finally have a major U.S. infrastructure program that creates jobs because that's the only place to create the economic multiplier that could really put the country into recovery. (Linda Bilmes,  5/13/20)
There are no easy or new answers to this question. Governments have been on a starvation diet in the U.S. for 30 years, maybe longer. Part of the challenge is the long game: people have to believe that they're getting value from government. If they ever needed evidence, looking around today at everything you are doing in cities to help people get through this crisis shows why government is first order essential to civilization as we know it. For an improvement in the climate, we must continue to demonstrate that government generates real value.
The best you can hope for from the federal government right now is that you may see some transitional relief. But until we convince people that government—including state and local government—can provide what they want and need, we won’t see this difficult fiscal situation change. (Dutch Leonard, 5/13/20) <SEP> Can we expect federal support to help us balance local budgets? <EOS>
The results from the early seroepidemiologic studies, acknowledging the limitations described above, indicate that few people have evidence of infection thus far.  This suggests that many people remain susceptible to infection, which is important in planning for subsequent resurgence in infection. <SEP> What do these results mean? <EOS>
Many communicable diseases, including COVID-19, can be spread by people who do not appear to be sick. Since these people feel well, they are unlikely to get tested and may not know they are carrying a virus. Contact tracing can help public health officials learn who these asymptomatic carriers are so they can be informed about appropriate prevention measures, to include testing and self-isolation. This helps keep disease at bay. <SEP> What is the purpose of contact tracing? <EOS>
The most recent CDC guidance states that someone who has had COVID-19 can discontinue isolation once they have met the following criteria:The CDC is no longer recommending a negative COVID-19 test before going back out in public.Anyone who tested positive for COVID-19 but never experienced symptoms may discontinue isolation 10 days after they first tested positive for COVID-19.Even after discontinuing isolation, you should still take all precautions when you go out in public, including wearing a mask, minimizing touching surfaces, and keeping at least six feet of distance away from other people. <SEP> How long after I start to feel better will be it be safe for me to go back out in public again? <EOS>
UV light or lamps should not be used to disinfect your skin.  UV radiation can irritate or harm your skin and eyes.  If you need to clean up, wash your hands with soap and water, use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol or take a shower and put on clean clothes.

A very small number of pets, including dogs and cats,  have been reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 after close contact with people with COVID-19. There have been no reports of pets becoming sick with COVID-19 in the United States. To date, there is no evidence that pets can spread the virus to people.
The first case of an animal testing positive for COVID-19 in the United States was a tiger with a respiratory illness at a zoo in New York City. Samples from this tiger were taken and tested after several lions and tigers at the zoo showed signs of respiratory illness.

If you get an antibody test, and it is positive, that means you have antibodies that likely resulted from a COVID-19 infection or possibly a related coronavirus infection.
If you get an antibody test, and it is negative, you probably have not been previously infected with COVID-19. You still could have a current infection and still could get sick, or spread the virus to others, if recently exposed. Antibodies don’t show up for 1 to 3 weeks after infection. Some people may take even longer to develop antibodies, and some people may not develop them at all. <SEP> What do the results of a COVID-19 antibody test mean? <EOS>
Human-to-human transmission by close contact with a person with confirmed COVID-19 has been reported and is thought to occur mainly via respiratory droplets produced when a person with infection coughs or sneezes. We do not know for sure if mothers with COVID-19 can spread the virus to babies in their breast milk, but the limited data available suggest this is not likely.
If you have COVID-19 and choose to breastfeed: Wear a cloth face covering while breastfeeding and wash your hands before each feeding.
If you have COVID-19 and choose to express breast milk: Use a dedicated breast pump, wear a cloth face covering during expression and wash your hands before touching any pump or bottle parts and before expressing breast milk, follow recommendations for proper pump cleaning [Español] after each use, cleaning all parts that come into contact with breast milk and if possible, expressed breast milk should be fed to the infant by a healthy caregiver who does not have COVID-19, is not at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19, and is living in the same home. <SEP> Is maternal illness with COVID-19 during lactation associated with potential risk to a breastfeeding infant? <EOS>
 There is ongoing research about how long the virus that causes COVID-19 can live on surfaces such as cardboard, plastic, stainless steel, and copper. There is still no indication that COVID-19 illness can be contracted from mail or packages. Spread is still considered to be most likely person to person. However, to provide an extra measure of sanitization, you can wipe off packages with disinfectants before you bring them in your house. You should still wash your hands after opening/handling packages. It is also important to continue to clean high touch surfaces such as counters, light switches, and door knobs regularly. <SEP>  Should I be concerned about getting COVID-19 from products or packages shipping from China or other parts of the world? <EOS>

On July 13, in all counties that at any time come onto the State’s monitoring list (including Santa Clara County),
    the State closed indoor operations for the following businesses and activities:

Gyms and fitness centers
Places of worship and cultural ceremonies, like weddings and funerals
Protests
Offices for non-critical
            infrastructure sectors
Personal care services, like hair salons, nail salons, body waxing, and tattoo parlors
Shopping malls

The State still allows these businesses and activities to operate outside, including for curbside pick-up. Any
    outdoor operations remain subject to the local Health Officer Order, the Mandatory Health Officer Directives, and
    any applicable laws or regulations. Even if Santa Clara County comes off of the monitoring list, these sectors will

Yes, you can safely go grocery shopping, but the best way to protect yourself and others is to limit exposure to the grocery store. This can be done by ordering delivery if that is possible, or reducing the number of shopping trips you take. Try to only go to the store every one or two weeks. Also try to limit the number of people who go on shopping trips. Leave your kids at home if you can as they like to touch surfaces and can carry the virus without showing symptoms.
Other safe practices are wiping down the handles of your cart with disinfectant wipes before use and leaving your phone in your pocket while in the store. Try to go back to a paper shopping list. If you bring reusable bags to the store you should wash them either with wipes or in the washing machine before using them again.
To pay, it is safest to use contactless pay, like Apple Pay. Credit cards and cash are safe as long as you are careful not to touch your face, and to disinfect your hands after you touch the pinpad.  
The risk of going shopping is not the foods or packaging, but the people you encounter. However, you should always wash your hands before and after handling food. The CDC also recommends you wash your hands again after you unload your groceries, and clean kitchen surfaces like countertops, cabinet handles and light switches.
It is not necessary to sanitize your groceries or leave them outside after purchasing them. The FDA and CDC report that there is no evidence of human or animal food or food packaging being associated with transmission of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Wash your fruits and vegetables like you would under normal circumstances.
The CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies). It is also essential to practice social distancing and stand six feet away from everyone in the store. Try not to touch your face, use hand sanitizer and wash your hands as soon as possible. <SEP> How can I safely grocery shop? <EOS>

Yes. And the increased risk applies to cancer patients of all ages, the CDC says. 
“Having cancer currently increases your risk of severe illness from COVID-19,” the CDC says. “At this time, it is not known whether having a history of cancer increases your risk.”
Researchers found that patients whose cancer was getting worse or spreading were more than five times more likely to die in a month if they caught Covid-19.
But there are steps cancer patients can take to stay as healthy as possible: 

Make sure you have at least a 30-day supply of your medications.
Don’t delay any life-saving treatment or emergency care during this pandemic.
Talk with your healthcare provider about your individual level of risk based on your condition, your treatment, and the level of transmission in your community.
Don’t stop taking your medicines or alter your treatment plan without talking to your healthcare provider.
Call your healthcare provider if you think you may have been exposed to the novel coronavirus.

The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention. <SEP> What are the symptoms of COVID-19? <EOS>

At this time, routine disinfection procedures for rooms, equipment and ambulances are recommended. Any waste generated is not considered Category A waste. Use disposable or dedicated patient-care equipment (e.g., blood pressure cuffs). If common use of equipment for multiple patients is unavoidable, clean and disinfect such equipment before use on another patient according to the equipment and disinfectant manufacturers’ instructions for use. It is not known how long SARS-CoV-2 remains infectious in the air. Therefore, the current recommendation is to use a time period consistent with airborne pathogens such as measles or tuberculosis. This means that the ambulance used to transport a patient with suspected COVID-19 infection should not be used for a period of two hours after the patient exits the vehicle or in accordance with the ACH, if that is known. If not known, emergency medical services agencies are encouraged to consult with the ambulance manufacturer to determine the vehicle's passenger compartment ACH for 99.9% removal of airborne contaminants. Use this to decide when it is safe to reintroduce the vehicle if less than the two-hour recommendation. <SEP> If a person with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 is transported in an ambulance, what is the cleaning procedure and downtime recommendation before that ambulance is allowed back into service? <EOS>
Those with symptoms should get tested immediately and consult with your health care provider to see if, or how frequently, they recommend re-testing. Close contacts of positive cases should get tested once, after the end of their 14-day quarantine period. There are no recommendations on re-testing.
Testing is available for people without symptoms who may just want to know their status. Those who have more frequent interactions with friends or strangers, especially if you or they are not using face coverings or social distancing, may wish to get tested once a month. Additionally, it’s a good idea to know your status if you plan to have close contact with someone who is older or has a chronic health condition. Frequent, recurring testing is not recommended for the general public at this time. However, the Division of Public Health (DPH) may advise you of the need for testing if ongoing monitoring suggests that COVID-19 disease rates are increasing in your area. DPH also recommends testing on a routine basis (at least once a month) be considered for employees in certain occupations, which are listed in the table below.
The chart below has some recommendations on how frequently you should get tested.

Rapid, point-of-care diagnostic tests use a mucus sample from the nose or throat but can be analyzed at the doctor’s office or clinic where the sample is collected and results may  be available in minutes. These may be molecular or antigen tests.
On March 21, 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued the first emergency use authorization (EUA) for a rapid molecular test. Since that time, at least one other rapid test for COVID-19 has been approved by FDA under an EUA. See the FDA’s webpage on Emergency Use Authorizations here for more information.  Virginia is aiming to rapidly expand testing for COVID-19. Testing capacity at commercial and private laboratories performing SARS-CoV-2 testing continues to increase.

The most aggressive strategy would be something involving quarantine and testing for all incoming travelers, which I think Hawaii is doing, as is Hong Kong. For many of us, that's not possible, so then it's about creating a healthy environment for tourists or travelers in the same way you do for all your community members: physical distancing, aggressive contact tracing, and encouraging interventions like non-medical fabric face masks that reduce transmission for everyone. (Dr. Caitlin Rivers, 5/26/20)
Some states are getting aggressive about out-of-state travel. That is being litigated and we'll see to what extent that that can hold, but if you're thinking about people coming into a new community, the most important thing is communication. They need to know everything that your residents know in terms of access to testing, health information, and rules like wearing masks. That communication can occur anywhere: gas stations as travelers arrive, bridges, ferries. You’re educating them to be responsible residents.
In summer, there is also the operational side to think about as isolated communities double or triple their size. They have to think about capacity building on the medical and public health side.

Unless specific local rules are prohibiting it, going outside and taking a walk where you stay at least 6' away from others can be a great, safe way to stay healthy.

As school districts across the United States consider whether and how to restart in-person classes, their challenge is complicated by a pair of fundamental uncertainties: No nation has tried to send children back to school with the virus raging at levels like America’s, and the scientific research about transmission in classrooms is limited.
“It feels like we’re playing Russian roulette with our kids and our staff,” said Robin Cogan, a nurse at the Yorkship School in Camden, N.J., who serves on the state’s committee on reopening schools.
It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal schedule this fall, requiring the grind of online learning, makeshift child care and stunted workdays to continue.
California’s two largest public school districts — Los Angeles and San Diego — said on July 13,  that instruction will be remote-only in the fall, citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in August.
For other districts, the solution won’t be an all-or-nothing approach. Many systems, including the nation’s largest, New York City, are devising hybrid plans that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days online. There’s no national policy on this yet, so check with your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening in your community.
Plan for the worst and, frankly, assume the worst. An outbreak at a school could slow operations to a halt for at least two weeks, and would be enormously disruptive. Many scientists and researchers think school reopenings might just be wishful thinking. <SEP> For children, what is school going to look like? <EOS>
Experts are predicting that there is likely to be at least another wave of COVID-19 infections, if not more. However, if we continue to stay at home and practice social distancing, this should mitigate the severity of future waves. Accordingly, it is critical that communities only begin to relax social distancing measures when there has been a meaningful and persistent reduction in the number of new cases per day. Further, when measures are relaxed, they should be done so in a gradual fashion. By “turning the faucet back on to a slow drip,” we will be better positioned to implement techniques to contain the spread of the virus that we know work—testing, isolation and quarantine, and contact tracing—and we will greatly reduce the stress on our hospitals and health care workers. (Juliette Kayyem, 4/11/20) <SEP> Should we be anticipating waves of this crisis—and start talking about that as something to anticipate? <EOS>

WHO guidance remains the same. Countries should not scale back efforts to detect and treat malaria; doing so would seriously undermine the health and well-being of millions of people infected with a potentially life-threatening disease.As signs and symptoms of malaria and COVID-19 can overlap (such as a fever), public health messages will need to be adapted in malaria-endemic settings so that people who have a fever are encouraged to seek immediate treatment rather than stay at home; without prompt treatment, a mild case of malaria can rapidly progress to severe illness and death. <SEP> Are there any changes to WHO guidance with respect to malaria diagnosis and treatment? <EOS>

The face covering guidance recognizes that there are some people who cannot wear a face covering for a number of different reasons. People are exempted from the requirement if they are under age 2, have a medical or mental health condition or disability that would make impede them from properly wearing or handling a mask, or when it would inhibit communication with a person who is hearing impaired.
Schools should develop protocols to provide a face covering to students who inadvertently fail to bring a face covering to school to prevent unnecessary exclusions.  The California Office of Emergency Services has distributed appropriate face coverings for each school throughout the state to local county offices of education. <SEP> What if an individual cannot wear a face covering? <EOS>

OSHA generally recommends that employers encourage workers to wear face coverings at work. Face coverings are intended to prevent wearers who have Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) without knowing it (i.e., those who are asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic) from spreading potentially infectious respiratory droplets to others. This is known as source control.
Consistent with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendation for all people to wear  cloth face coverings when in public and around other people, wearing cloth face coverings, if appropriate for the work environment and job tasks, conserves  other types of personal protective equipment (PPE), such as surgical masks, for healthcare settings where such equipment is needed most.
Employers have the discretion to determine whether to allow employees to wear cloth face coverings in the  workplace based on the specific circumstances present at the work site. For some workers, employers may determine that wearing cloth face coverings  presents or exacerbates a hazard. For example, cloth face coverings could  become contaminated with chemicals used in the work environment, causing  workers to inhale the chemicals that collect on the face covering. Over the duration of a work shift, cloth face coverings might also become damp (from  workers breathing) or collect infectious material from the work environment (e.g., droplets of other peoples' infectious respiratory secretions). Workers may also need to use PPE that is incompatible with the use of a cloth face covering (e.g., an N95 filtering facepiece respirator).
Where cloth face coverings are not appropriate in the work environment or during certain job tasks (e.g., because they could become contaminated or exacerbate heat illness), employers can provide PPE, such as face shields and/or surgical masks, instead of encouraging  workers to wear cloth face coverings. Like cloth face coverings, surgical masks and face shields can help contain the wearer's potentially infectious respiratory droplets and can help limit spread of COVID-19 to others.
Note that cloth face coverings are not considered PPE and cannot be used in place of respirators when  respirators are otherwise required.
Learn more about cloth face coverings on the CDC website.
Employers should consider evaluating their accessible communication policies and procedures to factor in potentially providing masks with clear windows to facilitate interaction between employees and members of the public who need to lip-read to communicate. <SEP> Should workers wear a cloth face covering while at work, in accordance with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendation for all people to do so when in public? <EOS>

NOTE: The Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness has warned of an increase in contact tracing scams via text. New Jersey contact tracers will never ask for your social security number or sensitive financial details like your bank or credit card number. For more information about the State's contact tracing efforts, how it stops the spread of COVID-19, and why it's so important to answer the phone when they call, visit the NJ COVID-19 Testing and Tracing portal.
The State has created a website to distinguish between facts and rumors/disinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic.
The site features unclassified intelligence products on COVID-19 disinformation, details about scams that New Jerseyans might be susceptible to, and cybersecurity alerts regarding potential threats to individuals and businesses caused by the pandemic.
Multiple foreign nations are leveraging the pandemic to sow anti-US sentiment and undermine the credibility of the United States. Additionally, individuals and groups domestically are using false or misleading information about COVID-19 to target their perceived adversaries and conduct scams.
The New Jersey Office Of Homeland Security and Preparedness encourages the public to use legitimate and credible organizations for accurate information, as well as to fact check claims from competing sources. Rumors can easily circulate within communities during a crisis, and the spread of disinformation can be stopped by choosing trusted sources of information.
Consumers who believe they were targeted by a scheme related to COVID-19 or who believe that businesses have unfairly increased their prices are encouraged to file a complaint online with the New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs or call 973-504-6240. Consumers should leave their name, contact information, nature of the complaint and the name and address of the business.

It is generally recognised that schools need to reopen for children to have a suitable learning environment and to mitigate the unintended negative social effects of school closures.
So far, the available evidence suggests that schools are no different to any other communal environment in terms of the risk of spreading the virus.
While there is evidence of transmission from adults to children in household settings, there is little evidence of this occurring within school environments.
Low proportions of antibodies found in children’s blood can be an indication that they are less susceptible to severe infection than adults, and therefore play a less significant role in the spread of the virus.
The level of safety depends on adherence to the previously-specified measures - increased physical distancing, improved ventilation, regular hand-washing and the use of masks when feasible. <SEP> 3. Is it safe for my child(ren) to go back to school? <EOS>
Free COVID-19 testing is available at many locations across the state.

If you lose your insurance coverage and you are totally disabled (including as a result of COVID-19), you have the following protections if you meet the requirements below. Totally disabled generally means that you can’t engage in any work or other gainful activity due to injury or disease. For a minor, totally disabled generally means that the minor can’t, due to injury or disease, engage in substantially all of the normal activities of a person of that age who is in good health. You should read your policy to learn the specific definition that applies to you.
Individual Coverage. If you are totally disabled on the date your individual health insurance policy terminates, your insurer will continue to pay for covered services for up to 12 months, or until you are no longer disabled, if sooner. You must have received treatment for your disability before your policy ends. The extended benefits are only available to treat the condition causing your disability.
Group Coverage Terminated for Non-Payment of Premiums or You Are No Longer Eligible for Coverage. If you are totally disabled on the date your coverage terminates, your insurer will provide benefits for a hospital stay beginning, or surgery performed, within 31 days from the date your coverage ends, or until you are no longer disabled, if sooner. The hospital stay or surgery must be to treat the condition causing your disability.
Group Coverage Terminated for Loss of Employment. If you are totally disabled on the date your coverage terminates, your insurer will provide benefits for covered services during a period of total disability for up to 12 months from the date your coverage ends, or until you are no longer disabled, if sooner. The extended benefits are only available to treat the condition causing your disability. Also, your insurer is not required to extend benefits if you have coverage for the services under another group health plan.
No Premium Payments. You are not responsible for paying premiums during an extension of benefits.

"Without symptoms" can refer to two groups of people: those who eventually do have symptoms (pre-symptomatic) and those who never go on to have symptoms (asymptomatic). During this pandemic, we have seen that people without symptoms can spread the coronavirus infection to others.A person with COVID-19 may be contagious 48 to 72 hours before starting to experience symptoms. In fact, people without symptoms may be more likely to spread the illness, because they are unlikely to be isolating and may not adopt behaviors designed to prevent spread.But what about people who never go on to develop symptoms? A recent study compared the amount of coronavirus in the nose, throat, and lungs of symptomatic and asymptomatic adults infected with SARS-CoV-2 (the COVID-19 coronavirus). Both groups of patients had similar amounts of virus in their bodies throughout the infection. This study did not look at the degree to which people with asymptomatic infections may infect others.This study provides yet another reason to wear face masks and observe physical distancing. Both measures can help reduce the risk that someone who does not have symptoms will infect others. <SEP> Do people without symptoms have the same amount of coronavirus in their bodies as people with symptoms?

It depends on the type of test, and where the sample is sent for testing. The results can come back in as quickly as 10 minutes or as long as several days, as some of the labs that are processing the test have a backlog and can take longer.

	This graph does not track the number of newly-diagnosed cases from day to day.
The reported date of a case can be re-assigned to an earlier date on rare occasions. 
The day someone got sick, the day they were tested, and the day public health was notified of the positive results might be several days apart.

Cases of COVID-19 by date of illness onset
What this graph shows: The estimated date of when symptoms began for cases of COVID-19 reported to public health.
What to know about this data: 
	This graph does not track the number of newly-diagnosed cases each day.
This graph is referred to as the “epi curve” and shows the frequency of new cases based on the date of onset of disease. Over time, this graph will provide the best picture of the actual progression of illness during an outbreak. 
This graph will change every day as new cases are investigated and information is entered about when symptoms started for each person. Cases that test positive today could show up with a symptom onset date of several days or weeks prior. 
Date of symptom onset is usually obtained after public health is able to investigate a case. Because it takes time to investigate cases, this graph is often several weeks behind in providing an accurate picture of transmission.

Cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 in Colorado by reported date to the state
What this graph shows: A cumulative total of the new number of COVID-19 cases that correspond to the date the case was reported to public health. 
What to know about this data:
This graph shows that we continue to have cases reported every day.
This graph does not track the number of cases reported from one day to the next
As long as cases continue to be reported, this graph will always go up.
The reported date of a case can be re-assigned to an earlier date on rare occasions. 

Cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 in Colorado by date of illness onset
What this graph shows: A cumulative total of the cases by the estimated date of when symptoms began. 
What to know about this data:: 
	This graph does not track the number of newly-diagnosed cases each day.
This graph will change every day as new cases are investigated and information is entered about when symptoms started for each person. 
Date of symptom onset is usually obtained after an epidemiologist is able to investigate a case. Due to the time it takes to investigate cases, this graph is often several weeks behind in providing accurate cumulative totals by onset date of illness.

Cases of COVID-19 in Colorado by county
What this graph shows: The number of people testing positive for, or determined as a probable case of, COVID-19 in each county.
What to know about this data:
Sometimes there is missing information or errors in preliminary data regarding county of residence. As more information is learned through case investigations, these numbers may change.

Case Rates per 100,000 People in Colorado by county
What this graph shows: The rate of people testing positive for, or determined as a probable case of, COVID-19 in each county. 

	NOTE ABOUT RATES: Because population sizes vary widely, rates are often used instead of counts to better compare the level of disease across different populations. This is done by dividing the number of cases in a community by the population of that community, and then multiplying that number by 100,000. Regardless of the true population of any given county, an estimated comparison can be made across populations by using a baseline of 100,000 people. 

What to know about this data:: 
	Caution should be used when interpreting rates in counties with small populations. In smaller populations with fewer cases, there is not enough information to make a valid comparison. Rates are not shown for counties with less than 5 cases. 
People who test positive in Colorado while visiting are included in the county where they were identified.
Sometimes there is missing information or errors in preliminary data regarding county of residence. As more information is learned through case investigations, these numbers may change.

Number of deaths among COVID-19 cases  in Colorado by date of death
What this graph shows: The number of deaths among people diagnosed with COVID-19 or with COVID-19 listed on their death certificate, recorded by the date a death occurred. 
What to know about this data:
Due to standard delays in the process of recording deaths in Colorado, it may be several days between the day a death occurs and the day the death appears in this graph. This means the number of deaths reported may change on a day-to-day basis (particularly within the past week) as reports of new deaths are received.
This graph includes deaths among people with COVID-19 - COVID-19 may or may not be listed as the cause of death on the death certificate.

Cumulative number of deaths among COVID-19 cases in Colorado by reported date to the state
What this graph shows: The cumulative number of deaths reported among people diagnosed with COVID-19 or with COVID-19 listed on their death certificate, corresponding to the date a person was reported to have COVID-19. The date a death is reported is often not the same as the actual date of death or the same as the date the case was initially reported to public health.
What to know about this data:
This graph does not track the date a death was reported 
This graph does not track the number of deaths reported from one day to the next
		Although we are tracking and collecting the date of death for each case, it can take several days before we receive a death certificate and are able to match the death to a known case. CDPHE is working with other state partners to streamline the process of reporting date of death in a more timely manner.

This graph includes deaths among people with COVID-19 - COVID-19 may or may not be listed as the cause of death on the death certificate.
This graph will change every day as new deaths occur and those deaths are attributed to when cases were first reported for each person..
The furthest column to the right provides an accurate accounting of the total deaths of COVID-19 to date.

Cumulative number of hospitalized cases of COVID-19 in Colorado by date reported to the state
What this graph shows: A cumulative running total of the number of people hospitalized with COVID-19, corresponding to the date their illness was reported. 
What to know about this data:
Knowing how many people have been hospitalized helps us understand the severity of disease.
As long as cases continue to be hospitalized, this graph will always go up.
This graph does not track the cumulative number of people who are newly-hospitalized each day.
This graph does not track the number of people who have been discharged from the hospital.
		Admission and discharge dates are not readily available for each patient. CDPHE is currently working with other partners to streamline this data and make it available.

Positivity data from clinical laboratories
What this graph shows: The total number of tests reported to CDPHE as being performed each day - and the percent of those tests that are positive for COVID-19. 

	The number of tests from CDPHE’s state laboratory are indicated in tan, the number of tests from other commercial labs are indicated in blue. Test numbers correspond to the scale on the left side of the graph.
The red line indicates the percent of tests reported that are positive. The percent of positive tests correspond to the scale on the right side of the graph.

What to know about this data:
The percent of positive tests is helpful for public health to track whether symptoms of people being tested are caused by COVID-19 (a higher positivity rate) or if their symptoms are being caused by something else (a lower positivity rate).
Total number of people tested might be underestimated because while most laboratories report all COVID test results to CDPHE, they are only required to report positive results.

Testing encounters
This data is a cumulative total from the positivity graph, which shows the total number of people tested each day. Many people get tested multiple times, and each of those tests is counted in the positivity graph as long as the tests were taken on separate days. If an individual was tested more than once in a given day, they will only be counted once for each day they have been tested.  
The Testing Encounters totals are higher than those represented in the People Tested numbers because in the People Tested numbers, individuals only are counted once, regardless of how many times they have been tested. <SEP> What does the case summay data mean? <EOS>
A decision to reopen schools in every country and area is made based on careful assessment of the situation, with consensus among all the key parties involved, including the health and education policy-makers, teachers and other school staff, parents and health and community workers. In addition, the reopening of schools are carefully planned and prepared, with all necessary measures in place to protect the safety and health of everyone in the school community.Therefore, if your school reopens, you should feel assured it is safe for you to go back to school – provided that you strictly follow the guidelines and rules that will be provided by your school.Of course, if you have any concerns with going back to school, do not hesitate to speak out to your teachers and parents or guardians. Read more:School reopening, UNESCO COVID-19 Education Response Education Sector Issue Note 7.1, April 2020Prepare for school reopening, IIEP-UNESCO's COVID response brief, April 2020 <SEP> Schools are reopening in some areas of my country.

This is related to the assumptions that warmer air temperatures and higher humidity environments will slow the transmission of the virus. While this is the case for influenza, some studies show that COVID-19 could follow the same patterns, however more research is necessary to prove such claims. As of now, claims related to weather conditions and the transmission rates of COVID-19 relation remain non-conclusive. Regarding "washing off" the virus from surfaces by water/rain, the only effective methods to disinfect and clean the surfaces as recommended by the CDC are: alcohol (70%), diluted household bleach solutions, and EPA-registered household disinfectants. Be sure to check the labels of each product before use for proper guidance.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, parents of infants may experience increased stress and fatigue that could affect their infants’ sleep practices. Safe sleep is an important part of keeping infants healthy, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. If you have an infant, you can help reduce your baby’s risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and other sleep-related deaths by doing the following:

Place your baby on his or her back for all sleep times – naps and at night.
Use a firm, flat sleep surface, such as a mattress in a crib, covered by a fitted sheet.
Have the baby share your room but not your bed. Your baby should not sleep on an adult bed, cot, air mattress, or couch, or on a chair alone, with you, or with anyone else.
Keep soft bedding such as blankets, pillows, bumper pads, and soft toys out of your baby’s sleep area.
Do not cover your baby’s head or allow your baby to get too hot. Signs your baby may be getting too hot include if he or she is sweating or if his or her chest feels hot.
Do not smoke or allow anyone to smoke around your baby. <SEP> What are the best safe sleep practices for my infant during the COVID-19 pandemic? <EOS>

Many people with COVID-19 have mild, flu-like symptoms (see above question 1), which are rather common and need to be distinguished from similar symptoms caused by common cold viruses and from allergic symptoms during springtime.
The following table presents a comparison of the most common symptoms of all three conditions according to their reported frequency.

This Phase 2 Executive Order does the following:
Lifts the Stay at Home Order and moves the state to a Safer at Home recommendation
Allows restaurants to open for on-premises dining with limits on occupancy, specific requirements for disinfection of common spaces and 6 feet between each group of customers sitting at each table
Allows child care businesses to open to serve all children, as long as they follow state health guidelines
Allows overnight camps to operate, following specific public health requirements and guidanceAllows personal care, grooming, massage and tattoo businesses to open with specific requirements for disinfection of equipment, face coverings for the service providers, 6 feet of distance between customers and at 50% reduced occupancy
Allows indoor and outdoor pools to open with 50% reduced occupancy, following specific public health requirements
Allows people to gather together for social purposes, so long as they do not exceed the mass gathering limit of 10 people indoors and 25 people outdoors

Even though the start of the school year will be virtual or online for many children, one thing that remains unchanged is the need to make sure children receive recommended vaccinations on schedule.
For many families, vaccinations are timed with back-to-school physicals. The COVID-19 pandemic has thrown things off schedule, and some families might even be wondering if their children need vaccines if they are not going to be in classrooms.
To be certain, yes, children need to continue to get recommended vaccines on schedule. Vaccines provide individual and community immunity, no matter where you are. The Virginia Department of Education is requiring all public school students to have required immunizations in order to begin the 2020-21 school year. <SEP> My child’s school is 100% virtual, do they need to have their immunizations and kindergarten physical  completed before they can begin school? <EOS>
 Schools will be allowed to operate May 23, 2020, but are subject to social distancing and sanitation rules and guidelines.These facilities are encouraged to use enhanced sanitation and social distancing practices consistent with guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH). To help prevent COVID-19 transmission, there are several things individuals and businesses can do, including wearing a mask. Requirements and recommendations for individuals, employers, employees, and customers are listed in the Safer at Home health order. In addition to complying with the requirements, childcares and daycare centers are strongly encouraged to read and implement ADPH's Guidelines for Safeguarding All Businesses and Guidelines for Child Day Care Facilities. <SEP>  May I operate my childcare or daycare center? <EOS>
Different types have different levels of effectiveness, according to researchers at Florida Atlantic University. 
They compared four types of face masks commonly used by the public: a stitched mask with two layers of fabric, a commercial cone mask, a folded handkerchief, and a bandana. Researchers tested each to see which would likely offer the most protection if someone coughed or sneezed.
— The stitched mask with two layers of fabric performed the best, with droplets traveling only 2.5 inches. 
— With a cone-style mask, the droplets traveled about 8 inches. 
— A folded handkerchief performed worse, with droplets traveling 1 foot, 3 inches. 
— The bandana gave the least amount of protection of the cloth masks tested, with droplets traveling 3 feet. 
— Still, any kind of cloth mask is better than none, the researchers found. Without any covering, droplets were able to travel 8 feet. 
“People need to know that wearing masks can reduce transmission of the virus by as much as 50%, and those who refuse are putting their lives, their families, their friends, and their communities at risk,” said Dr. Christopher Murray, director of the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. <SEP> How effective are different types of face masks? Which cloth masks work the best? <EOS>
Since the original June 5th guidance, CDPH has recommended daily visual wellness and symptoms checks prior to individuals entering campus. In order to facilitate those checks, the California Office of Emergency Services has distributed multiple no-touch thermometers for each school throughout the state to local county offices of education.  These checks can happen in a variety of ways, including: As the individuals enters the building or during morning homeroom. Students can be asked about their symptoms or can complete a short checklist of symptoms and hand it in. Follow-up to those checklists should occur whenever symptoms of COVID-19 are identified. <SEP> Does the CDPH guidance encourage an active screening of students, staff, and other individuals entering campus? <EOS>
Countries are equally vulnerable to COVID-19 and have a shared responsibility, grounded in solidarity, to collaborate globally to mitigate the outbreak. Each government has special obligations to its own citizens, but the fair allocation of vaccines globally
    requires us not to simply appeal to self-interest, claims of resource ownership and the prioritization of compatriots. Vaccines should be allocated in a way that prioritizes those who fall into the categories presented in the below table. (Where individuals

Children, including very young children, can develop COVID-19. Many of them have no symptoms. Those that do get sick tend to experience milder symptoms such as low-grade fever, fatigue, and cough. Some children have had severe complications, but this has been less common. Children with underlying health conditions may be at increased risk for severe illness.A complication that has more recently been observed in children can be severe and dangerous. Called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), it can lead to life-threatening problems with the heart and other organs in the body. Early reports compare it to Kawasaki disease, an inflammatory illness that can lead to heart problems. But while some cases look very much like Kawasaki's, others have been different.Symptoms of MIS-C can include
fever lasting more than a couple of days
rash
conjunctivitis (redness of the white part of the eye)
stomachache
vomiting and/or diarrhea
a large, swollen lymph node in the neck
red, cracked lips
a tongue that is redder than usual and looks like a strawberry
swollen hands and/or feet
irritability and/or unusual sleepiness or weakness.
Many conditions can cause these symptoms. Doctors make the diagnosis of MIS-C based on these symptoms, along with a physical examination and medical tests that check for inflammation and how organs are functioning. Call the doctor if your child develops symptoms, particularly if their fever lasts for more than a couple of days. If the symptoms get any worse or just don't improve, call again or bring your child to an emergency room.Doctors have had success using various treatments for inflammation, as well as treatments to support organ systems that are having trouble. While there have been some deaths, most children who have developed MIS-C have recovered. <SEP> How does COVID-19 affect children? <EOS>
Children can be more reluctant because they’re more sensitive to new things than adults are, said Christopher Willard, a psychiatry lecturer at Harvard Medical School.
“There’s also the weird psychological aspect of not being able to see their own face or other people’s faces and facial expressions,” which can hinder their feelings of comfort or safety, he said.
To ease their mask fears, try buying or making masks with fun designs on them. Or have your child customize his or her own masks by drawing on them with markers.
You can also order children’s face masks with superheroes on them or show your kids photos of their favorite celebrities wearing masks.
It’s also important to set a good example by wearing a mask yourself. Show your children your own mask, and let them know that by wearing one, they’ll be just like Mom or Dad. <SEP> My kids don’t want to wear a mask. What should I do? <EOS>
Globally, a small number of animals have become infected with SARS-CoV-2 after exposure to people with COVID-19. Initial animal infections were detected in two dogs in Hong Kong, neither of which shows signs of illness associated with SARS-CoV-2.
Since then, there have been a few reports of natural infection detected in cats, dogs, mink, tigers and lions after exposure to people with COVID-19. The USDA website lists cases of SARS-CoV-2 in animals that have been confirmed by USDA’s National Veterinary Services Laboratories. The first description of animal illness associated with natural SARS-CoV-2 was recently published in a MMWR Report: First Reported Cases of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Companion Animals — New York, March–April 2020. Illness associated with SARS-CoV-2 in animals, based on limited information to date, tends to be mild and self-limiting.
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19 and the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. However, because we are still learning about this virus and because all animals can carry germs that can make people sick, it is always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals. This includes washing hands before and after interacting with animals or handling their food, waste, or supplies. According to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), there is no justification in taking measures against companion animals that may compromise their welfare, such as harming them or abandoning them based on unfounded fears over COVID-19.
Veterinarians should contact their State Public Health Veterinarian, State Veterinarian or designated animal health official if they are seeing a new, concerning illness in a patient that has had close contact with a person with COVID-19 and other, more common causes of illness have been ruled out. <SEP> What is known about animals that have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19? <EOS>
A customer or visitor who cannot wear a face covering due to a medical or mental health condition or disability is exempt from the face covering requirements of the Executive Order. A business is not required to allow entry to a customer or visitor not wearing a face covering. However, the business may allow the customer or visitor into their store or workplace, as long as it takes the following into account:

A business has to protect their workers from hazards—including COVID-19 infection. If visitors or customers who are not wearing a face covering for medical or mental health reasons are allowed in a store or workplace, the business must take steps to prevent such visitors or customers from posing a hazard to the business’ workers (refer to the question above for additional information about this topic).
Under the Executive Order a business must, when possible, offer a reasonable accommodation, such as permitting use of an alternate form of face covering (e.g., face shield) or providing service options that do not require a customer to enter the business.
Federal law, including the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), may also create obligations for businesses or employers. You can get more information about the ADA and COVID-19 from the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and businesses should talk to their legal representatives for specific advice. In general, a person with a disability should be offered a reasonable accommodation, but it does not have to be their preferred accommodation, as long as what is offered would be effective. If a business has offered several reasonable options and the customer or visitor has refused them all and offered no additional options, the business is justified in refusing entry and should refuse entry to the visitor or customer. Also, the ADA does not  require a business to admit a person or provide a service when doing so would present a direct threat to the health or safety of others—including workers and other customers or visitors. <SEP> Can a business allow a customer or visitor into their store or workplace if the customer or visitor cannot wear a face covering due to a medical or mental health condition or disability? <EOS>

This is a hard question, especially because a stagnant economy also damages the lives and livelihoods of unemployed people. No one wants another recession, and spending money at local businesses is a good way to re-grease the wheels. But no one wants to get sick or contribute in any way to a second wave either.
Weigh the gains against the losses — not just for you, but for everyone. You can find your way back into a new kind of normal if you approach reopening thoughtfully and apply ethical guidelines to your behavior.
Before you plan an errand, ask yourself a few questions. 
1. Is this necessary? If you’re going to a store for food or supplies, the answer is yes. But if you are dealing with your emotional health and the health of your relationships by seeing the people you love, that answer might also be yes. 
2. Is this necessary now? Again, this might also be a yes. But separate needs from wants. You might want a haircut. Do you need one? You want to go sit in a restaurant. Must you? 
3. Can I do this thing in a safer way? This requires some creative thinking, but the answer is also, probably, yes. You might be missing your religious community, and your house of worship is back open. Is there a way to move the service outside, instead of sitting in the crowded room? You’re desperate to see your friends. And you should — mental health matters. But can you see them in their backyard, instead of their living room? <SEP> How should I decide where and how to go to stores? <EOS>
The Defence Team continues to tailor its COVID-19 response in consultation and coordination with other Government of Canada (GC) departments and agencies, while simultaneously preparing for subsequent phases of the crisis. As such, the Defence Team is preparing for the near-term resumption of a number of designated business activities across the DND/CAF.
Despite the fact that a treatment or a vaccine has not yet been developed and our understanding of the disease and its strategic implications are still evolving, the Defence Team must resume a number of activities that were suspended during the initial response to this pandemic. Specifically, a number of critical force generation activities related to training, recruitment and administration will resume on a limited basis when it has been deemed safe and appropriate to do so. This effort will be initiated in an asymmetrical, decentralized manner across the country and will be phased, conditions-based and utilize a locally-informed approach.
Over time, delays or cancellations of these force generation activities can result in the erosion of force strength and readiness, which in turn, adversely impacts our ability to conduct operations and achieve mission success on behalf of the Government of Canada.  As such, the CAF are deliberately re-activating critical force generation, management and sustainment activities in a permanently altered COVID-19+ environment that are essential to the long-term health and readiness of the force. <SEP> Why is the Defence Team resuming certain business activities during the COVID-19 pandemic and what activities will resume in the short term? <EOS>

There is no scientific proof or evidence that wearing a disposable mask or cloth face covering can hurt your oxygen levels or make you breathe in dangerous levels of carbon dioxide.  Unlike medical N-95 respirators, disposable masks and cloth face coverings fit more loosely and air can pass through. They help us by cutting down on the droplets that come out when we speak, cough or sneeze.  Face covers should not be worn when exercising, by children under two or anyone who has a health condition that makes it hard to breathe or take off their face cover without help.  There are some reports of health care workers being affected by wearing N-95 respirators for many hours; however, the public should not be using this type of face covering.  Wearing a face covering may feel weird or uncomfortable because we are not used to it and can be a challenge if it's hot and humid or your glasses fog up.    If you are having a hard time breathing, your cloth face covering might be too thick.  See Cloth Face Covers for more information. <SEP> Does wearing a disposable mask or cloth face covering hurt my oxygen levels? <EOS>
Due to different reporting requirements and surveillance definitions, timelines, and other factors, the CMS nursing home data will likely differ from data reported by VDH.  CMS posts COVID-19 data submitted by nursing homes via the CDC's National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN), but not all nursing homes have started reporting to NHSN at this time.  As with any new reporting program, some of the data from early submissions to NHSN may be inaccurate.  Retrospective reporting to NHSN before May 1, 2020 is optional, therefore, not all facilities will report their cumulative data from the beginning of the outbreak.  VDH outbreak data are reported based on the state outbreak investigations, which are independently related to CMS reporting.
CMS nursing home data will be updated weekly and can be found at: https://data.cms.gov/Covid19-nursinghome-data <SEP> Why do CMS and VDH nursing home data differ? <EOS>

All coronaviruses possess a fat layer as a component of the viral envelope. There is, however, no evidence yet that SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) exhibits structural stability at low temperatures or that its fat envelope facilitates transmission at low temperatures.
This claim was likely derived from studies showing that SARS-CoV (the SARS virus from the early 2000s, not the one that causes COVID-19) exhibits structural stability at relatively low temperatures (22–25°C), though it was never shown that this was associated with it being "transmitted [between people or between surfaces and people] better in the cold."
In fact, enveloped viruses with a fat membrane are usually more sensitive to neutralizing agents (like chemical antiseptics) and conditions (like changes in temperature or pH) than non-enveloped viruses.

Telehealth or telemedicine allows you to have a live video consultation with your doctor without visiting their office in person.
During the COVID-19 emergency, telehealth is quickly becoming a widely used option for patients across New Jersey to receive care.
Patients are encouraged to use telehealth for visits whenever possible during the COVID-19 emergency.
Telehealth allows you to access care for many conditions without leaving your home and risking COVID-19 exposure. It also protects health care workers by reducing their exposure.
Telehealth visits with various types of providers are now covered by most insurance plans.
When possible, it is recommended that you seek telehealth care from your current doctor or medical groups. They have an existing relationship with you and are already familiar with your medical records.
For a comprehensive list of available telehealth resources in New Jersey, visit https://bit.ly/QITelehealthResource.
Legislation (A3680 and A3682) signed on March 19, 2020 expands access to telehealth services and allows professional and occupational licensing boards to expedite licensure of out-of-state professionals.

VDH recommends that you stay home for 14 days after the last time you saw that person and practice social distancing. Social distancing means keeping a distance of at least 6 feet from others. Do not go to work or school during this time period. Avoid all public spaces, public activities, and group gatherings and do not take public transportation such as buses, trains taxis, or ride-shares during this time. If necessary, your local health department can ensure that your basic needs (for example, food and medication) are being met.
Monitor your health closely during this 14-day time period. When monitoring your health, be aware of the most common signs of COVID-19 (fever, cough, shortness of breath). Other signs of COVID-19 include chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat and a new loss of taste or smell. If you develop signs of illness, take appropriate actions. If you have only mild illness, it is important to stay home and rest to prevent spreading infection to others. Not everyone with COVID-19 will have all symptoms and fever might not be present. If you do have symptoms and want to get tested for COVID-19, please reach out to your healthcare provider. Your provider may collect samples to test you or help you to find sampling sites in your area. If you have a medical emergency, call 911 and let them know that you have had exposure to a person with COVID-19. <SEP> What should I do if I have had close contact with someone with COVID-19? <EOS>

“US citizens, particularly travelers with underlying health conditions, should not travel by cruise ship,” the US Department of State says. 
Cruise ship passengers are at an increased risk of infection, the CDC says. The virus spreads more easily between passengers in tight quarters. 
Several cruise ships have been linked to coronavirus, including the Diamond Princess, where more than 700 people were infected. Half of those infected didn’t have symptoms when they tested positive. At least seven of those patients have died. 
Since the coronavirus outbreak started, some cruise lines have implemented more flexible rebooking or cancellation policies. <SEP> I have plans to go on a cruise. Should I rebook or cancel? <EOS>

The role of children in transmission is not well understood. To date, few outbreaks involving children or schools have been reported. However, the small number of outbreaks reported among teaching or associated staff also suggests that spread of COVID-19 within educational settings may be limited. As children generally have milder illness and fewer symptoms, cases may sometimes go unnoticed. Importantly, early data from studies suggest that infection rates among teenagers may be higher than in younger children. Some modelling studies suggest that school re-opening might have a small effect on wider transmission in the community, but this is not well understood.Further studies are underway on the role of children in transmission in and outside of educational settings. WHO is collaborating with scientists around the world to develop protocols that countries can use to study COVID transmission in educational institutions, which will soon be available at this link. <SEP> What is the role of children in transmission? <EOS>

Some people may experience increased anxiety and fear of bias and being profiled wearing face coverings in public spaces – but wearing a cloth face covering protects your family, friends and neighbors.
If you are the target of ethnic or racial intimidation as the result of adhering to the face covering provision or as a result of the pandemic, you are strongly encouraged to report the matter to law enforcement or another government entity.

OSHA requires covered employers to provide required personal protective equipment (PPE) necessary to protect you on the job. Your employer should follow the latest OSHA and CDC guidance, including on hazard assessment and PPE selection.
For PPE that is not determined to be required to protect workers, your employer may permit or prohibit the use of worker's personal equipment. CDC recommends universal use of cloth face coverings, which are not considered PPE. Growing evidence shows that cloth face coverings help prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
Employers must train workers about how to put on, use, and take off PPE safely.
For more information, see  OSHA's PPE Safety and Health Topics page and the PPE standards (29 CFR Part 1910, Subpart I). <SEP> Can I bring my own personal  protective equipment to use at work if I believe I am at risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2,  the virus that causes COVID-19, on the job? <EOS>
Yes, infected people can transmit the virus both when they have symptoms and when they don’t have symptoms. This is why it is important that all people who are infected are identified by testing, isolated, and, depending on the severity of their disease, receive medical care.  Even people confirmed to have COVID-19 but who do not have symptoms should be isolated to limit their contact with others.  These measures break chains of transmission. This is why it is always important to stay at least 1 metre from others, cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze with a bent elbow or tissue, clean hands regularly, and stay home if you become unwell or if asked. In areas where there is widespread transmission, it is also important that people wear a fabric mask where physical distancing and other control measures cannot be implemented.  More information on the use of masks can be found here. <SEP> Can people without symptoms transmit the virus? <EOS>
 Yes, as outlined in Section 6004 of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA). Further information is available at the CDC and on the ADHS websites. <SEP>  Is AHCCCS covering COVID-19 antibody testing? <EOS>
The risk of serious illness from COVID-19 increases steadily with age, especially for those with underlying medical problems like chronic bronchitis, emphysema, cardiovascular disease, serious heart conditions, obesity, or diabetes. According to a recent study published in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, certain underlying medical conditions may increase the risk of serious COVID-19 for individuals of any age.The strongest evidence supporting increased risk of serious COVID-19 illness applies to the following conditions:
chronic kidney disease
COPD (chronic bronchitis or emphysema)
obesity (body mass index [BMI] of 30 or higher)
immunocompromised state (weakened immune system) from solid organ transplant
serious heart conditions, including coronary artery disease, heart failure, and other diseases of the heart muscle
sickle cell disease
type 2 diabetes.
Conditions that might increase risk of severe COVID-19 illness include:
moderate to severe asthma
cerebrovascular disease such as stroke
cystic fibrosis
high blood pressure
weakened immune response due to blood or bone marrow transplant, immune deficiencies, HIV or AIDS, use of corticosteroids, or use of other immune-weakening medications
any condition or treatment that weakens the immune response (cancer, cancer treatment, organ or bone marrow transplant, immunosuppressant medications, HIV or AIDS)
neurologic conditions, such as dementia
liver disease
pregnancy
pulmonary fibrosis (damaged or scarred lung tissue)
smoking
thalassemia (a blood disorder)
type 1 diabetes.
According to the CDC, hospitalizations have been six times higher and deaths 12 times higher among those with reported underlying conditions compared with those who did not have underlying health conditions.In addition, among COVID-19 cases with known race and ethnicity, 33% were Hispanic, 22% were black, and 1.3% were non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native. These findings suggest that these groups, who account for 18%, 13%, and 0.7% of the US population, respectively, are disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.Everything we are learning underscores the importance of maintaining health-promoting behaviors, even as restrictions begin to ease, especially if you have an underlying medical condition. To reduce your risk of getting sick, continue to stay home when possible, wear a mask and maintain a physical distance of at least six feet when you're around other people, and wash your hands often. <SEP> Who is at highest risk for getting very sick from COVID-19? <EOS>

Minnesota has strongly recommended widespread use of face coverings since April. As shown in other states, COVID-19 surges can happen quickly—even in areas with previously low or decreasing case numbers—and with disastrous consequences. Because Minnesota has begun the process of reopening its economy and people are now leaving the home more frequently, smart, simple infection-control measures, like wearing a face covering, are particularly important to prevent further COVID-19 spread. Previously, Minnesota and other states encouraged voluntary compliance with face covering recommendations, but compliance with such recommendations has been inconsistent and face covering requirements have been shown to increase consistent face covering use.(6) Other states are having success controlling the spread of COVID-19 by mandating face coverings in certain settings in accordance with CDC and WHO recommendations. <SEP> Why is there a state mandate? <EOS>

Health care workers’ masks are very effective. But there aren't enough for all of us to be able to wear them. Instead, CDC recommends fabric face masks. They are required for us here in Maryland, and I wear one every time I go outside. They are fairly good at protecting other people. This virus is spread largely through droplets that we emit when we talk, cough, and so on, and the masks help to contain the droplets.
We don't think the masks are very effective at protecting the wearer from infection, however. There’s a powerful phrase: "My mask protects you, and your mask protects me." If we all wear them, it is a powerful intervention. But the individual-level protection is less pronounced. (Dr. Caitlin Rivers, 5/26/20)
A real concern is that people wearing masks won’t feel they need to socially distance. They do. The general idea masks are better than none makes sense, but efficacy depends on the mask, how it's used, and the risk of harm if not used properly. Nothing is perfect here. The key is not to suggest these tools are going to fully protect people. (Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, 5/13/20)
Also, requiring masks shouldn't be used as an excuse not to set up other protective barriers like plexiglass to protect essential workers. (Dr. Josh Sharfstein, 5/13/20) <SEP> How effective are masks for slowing transmission? <EOS>
NIH understands that travel restrictions may continue to occur through the remainder of the public health emergency and may affect international students and post-docs.

The Center for Disease Control now recommends that people without symptoms wear cloth masks in public to reduce the risk of asymptomatic spread. A reasonable position would be to encourage wearing masks while emphasizing that it's social distancing and not just the mask that prevents spread from person to person. (Dr. Josh Sharfstein, 4/6/20)
Anyone who is ill should cover their mouth and nose to reduce the number of virus particles dispersed into the environment. If masks are not available, they can use clothing, bandanas, or scarves. If you're a caregiver for someone in your home who is ill, that person should wear a mask and when you are near them you should also wear a mask of some kind to help reduce your risk of infection. (Dr. Tom Frieden, 4/2/20) <SEP> Should the general public cover their faces with bandanas or other makeshift masks? <EOS>
If you have  symptoms of COVID-19, you should get tested now. 
People with COVID-19 have reported  many different types of symptoms, including:
				
Cough
Shortness of breath or difficulty  breathing
Fever
Chills
Muscle or body aches
Headache
Sore throat
New loss of taste or smell
Congestion or runny nose
Nausea or vomiting
Diarrhea

				This list does not include all possible symptoms.
Most  people with COVID-19 have mild to moderate symptoms and recover on their own.  Less commonly, COVID-19 may lead to pneumonia, other severe complications,  hospitalization or death.
If you  have mild to moderate symptoms, stay home. Do not leave home except to get  essential medical care (including testing for COVID-19) or to get basic needs  such as groceries, if someone can't get them for you.
You  should call your health care provider if you have symptoms and one of the  following applies to you:
	
You are  50 years of age or older, pregnant, or have other health conditions, such as:

Lung  disease
Moderate  to severe asthma
Heart  disease
A  weakened immune system
Obesity
Diabetes
Kidney  disease
Liver  disease
Cancer

You do  not feel better in 3-4 days

If you  need help finding a doctor or getting medical care, call Health + Hospitals' hotline  844-NYC-4NYC (844-692-4692). The City of New York will provide  medical care no matter what your immigration status is and regardless of your  ability to pay.

A face covering can help prevent you  from spreading COVID-19 to other people. All New Yorkers must wear a face  covering whenever they need to be outside their home and cannot maintain at  least 6 feet of distance between themselves and others. A face covering is any well-secured paper or cloth (like a bandana or a  scarf) that covers your nose and mouth. For more information about what  type of face covering should be used and how, visit nyc.gov/health/coronavirus. To  learn about how to obtain a face covering, visit nyc.gov/facecoverings.
New  Yorkers can report their health status to the City if they have symptoms, have  tested positive for COVID-19, have come into contact with someone who may have  COVID-19, or are currently in quarantine.

Oftentimes, for a mayor, the status quo is actually a more dangerous choice than trying something new, even if it’s not clear yet if it will work. In February and early March when people were so resistant to quarantine, I’m sure you were told, “oh, we can’t quarantine, we can't do this, we don't have all this in place.” Well, that's true, but as Dr. Frieden has told us, waiting two or three more days could have doubled the number of lives lost.
You had to act because the status quo was actually the more dangerous choice, and moving into a 75% future might actually be safer. The leader's job is to remind people that the status quo is not always the safe thing even though it might feel safe. 
While bureaucracies certainly have constraints, some of the rules and procedures that public employees abide by are more flexible than many perceive.

Those planning celebrations at home should consider virtual celebrations. If virtual celebrations cannot be held, organizers should keep the gathering as low-risk as possible by holding the event outside, ensuring attendees who do not live in the same household remain 6 feet apart, discouraging sharing of food or drinks, ensuring attendees wear face coverings, and inviting only local friends and families to attend.
The more people an individual interacts with and the longer the interaction lasts, the higher the risk for infection. The risk of COVID-19 spreading at events and gatherings increases as follows:

Lowest Risk: Online/virtual gatherings and events
Low Risk: A small event that includes only neighbors (from the same local area); event occurs outdoors with 6 feet of distance between people who do not live in the same household and sharing of food or drinks does not occur
Higher Risk: A larger event occurs outdoors with 6 feet of distance between people who do not live in the same household; sharing of food or drink does not occur, but attendees may come from out of town
Highest Risk: A large number of people are present, with attendees coming from out of town; physical distancing of 6 feet between people who do not live in the same household is difficult to maintain <SEP> What is the safest way to host celebrations at home? <EOS>
When making preparedness and response plans for the COVID-19 pandemic, include essential services for violence against women. Allocate adequate resources for services for survivors and identify ways to make them accessible – particularly in the context of measures to restrict people’s movement. Explore the use of telemedicine, digital health, or mhealth to enhance access to support and services for survivors, while ensuring this is safe for them.  Explore alternative shelters for women who may require this. Ensure that lockdown measures do not penalize women for seeking support when experiencing violence, such as by going to the police or hospital to report violence. <SEP> I am a policy maker.

WHO is actively following the ongoing clinical trials that are being conducted in response to COVID-19, including the more than 80 studies looking at the use of chloroquine and its derivative, hydroxychloroquine, for treatment and/or prevention. To date, 3 large randomized controlled trials, including the WHO Solidarity trial, have failed to show that the use of hydroxychloroquine among hospitalized patients infected with COVID-19 can prevent death or disease progression. Additionally, 3 trials of patients with mild or moderate disease failed to show a significant benefit in prevention of respiratory failure through the use of hydroxychloroquine. Thus, there is now growing evidence that hydroxychloroquine is not an effective treatment for COVID-19. This evidence will inform the next update of WHO guidance on therapeutics. Studies on the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine to prevent individuals, particularly those at high risk such as health care workers, from contracting COVID-19 are ongoing. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to assess the protective efficacy of either of these medicines for the prevention of COVID-19 infection or disease. WHO cautions physicians against administering these unproven treatments to patients with COVID-19 outside the context of a clinical trial. Individuals are also advised against self-medicating with these drugs.For public health emergencies, WHO has a systematic and transparent process for research and development (R&D), including for clinical trials of drugs. The WHO “R&D Blueprint” for COVID-19, initiated on 7 January 2020, aims to fast-track the availability of effective tests, vaccines and medicines that can be used to save lives and avert large-scale crises. <SEP> What is WHO’s position on the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the context of the COVID-19 response? <EOS>
Current data suggest person-to-person transmission most commonly happens during close exposure to a person infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, primarily via respiratory droplets produced when the infected person speaks, coughs, or sneezes. Droplets can land in the mouths, noses, or eyes of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs of those within close proximity. Transmission also might occur through contact with contaminated surfaces followed by self-delivery to the eyes, nose, or mouth. The contribution of small respirable particles, sometimes called aerosols or droplet nuclei, to close proximity transmission is currently uncertain. However, airborne transmission from person-to-person over long distances is unlikely.
Healthcare personnel evaluating or providing care for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should use Standard Precautions, Contact Precautions, Airborne Precautions, and use eye protection (e.g., goggles or a face shield). See the Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Known or Patients Under Investigation for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings. <SEP> How should healthcare personnel protect themselves when evaluating a patient who may have COVID-19? <EOS>

While we expect limited impact at most military pharmacies, all eligible beneficiaries may be impacted due to the spread of COVID-19. <SEP> Will this impact me? <EOS>
Yes, as long as the close contacts have no symptoms of COVID-19 AND are not healthcare workers (different recommendations exist for healthcare personnel).  Close contacts, such as household members of PUIs, are considered “low-risk” until SARS-CoV-2 test results are available. While test results are pending, close contacts should be instructed to self-observe for symptoms compatible with COVID-19. There are no movement restrictions for the close contacts of PUIs, but CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain. However, it is very important that people with even mild signs of illness (fever, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, chills, muscle aches, or new loss of taste or smell) stay home to prevent spreading illness to others! 
If the PUI is confirmed to have COVID-19, all household contacts will be subject to quarantine for at least 14 days after last exposure to the case, or 14 days after the case is released from isolation if contact is never broken. During the quarantine period, individuals will not be allowed to attend work or school. For more information, see "Releasing Cases and Contacts from Home Isolation and Quarantine". <SEP> If a PUI is under home isolation, can their household contacts attend work or school? <EOS>
Many medical and dental practices now have sufficient personal protective equipment and have instituted comprehensive safety measures to help protect you, the doctor and office staff, and other patients. If you feel anxious about visiting in person, call the practice.Many doctor's offices are increasingly providing telehealth services. This may mean appointments by phone call, or virtual visits using a video chat service. Ask to schedule a telehealth appointment with your doctor for a new or ongoing nonurgent matter. If, after speaking to you, your doctor would like to see you in person, he or she will let you know.What if your appointments are not urgent but also don't fall into the low-risk category? For example, if you have been advised to have periodic scans after cancer remission, if your doctor sees you regularly to monitor for a condition for which you're at increased risk, or if your treatment varies based on your most recent test results?

A diagnosis may not be possible in a teledentistry appointment.  It may require a physical exam and new x-days.  But, impressions may be helpful to advice, educate, or triage the patient.
Dental providers must follow HIPAA rules. Providers should:
    
Only use DoD or DHA-approved means to conduct the visit (This only applies to military providers.)
Confirm the patient’s identity.

On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China. The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19. In COVID-19, ‘CO’ stands for ‘corona,’ ‘VI’ for ‘virus,’ and ‘D’ for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as “2019 novel coronavirus” or “2019-nCoV”.
There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses.

To further strengthen the ability of New Jersey's public workforce to respond to COVID-19, Governor Murphy signed an executive order allowing retirees to return to State and local government employment to help the State throughout this emergency.
Under the Executive Order, retirees may return to State and local government employment without impacting their retirement pensions and removes restrictions on law enforcement's ability to temporarily supplement their ranks.
Furthermore, under an additional Executive Order, any public employee eligible for enrollment into the State Health Benefits Program (SHBP) may immediately enroll upon hire, rather than waiting two months. The order will last for the duration of the emergency and applies to any public employee eligible for enrollment into the SHBP who is hired on or after March 9, 2020.
Retirees may return to public employment in any capacity, including full-time, part-time or as SLEOs, provided:

The retiree has retired before the date of the executive order;
The retiree has completed at least a 30-day separation from their employment, dating from the date of retirement or the date of board approval, whichever is later; and
The retiree's return to employment is necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic.

If you are back to work but working less than full-time hours, you may be able to continue receiving unemployment benefits. However, the amount you earn will affect your weekly benefit amount (WBA). If you are working with reduced hours (underemployed), you are required to report your gross earnings for each week you work when you certify for benefits. Earnings include any wages from employment or payment for personal services. You can check your MiWAM account page for the reduced payment amount.
Other types of payments that you are required to report include the value of room and board related to employment (for example, a property manager living on site that does not pay rent or utilities), vacation or holiday pay; bonus pay, severance pay and pension payments.
When special payments are reported, the Unemployment Insurance Agency determines if these payments will reduce a claimant’s benefit payment, and if so, the amount of the reduction. For special payments you will receive a determination (Form UIA 1302) with details about the reduced payment. 
In general, if gross earnings or special payments for the week exceed 1.5 times your weekly benefit amount (excessive earnings), you will not be eligible for benefits for that week, including the $600 Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (PUC) payment.
To calculate your earnings for the week, multiply your hourly rate of pay by the number of hours you worked during the week (Sunday through Saturday).
For Example:

When certifying each week online or by phone, be sure to answer yes when asked if you worked during a specific week. Be sure to report earnings for the week in which you performed the work, NOT the week in which you received the payment. Report the total amount of earnings before taxes are taken out. <SEP> Can a person work part-time and still collect UI benefits? <EOS>

Start with local and state health departments and ask what they’re doing. If you do not have a public health department in your city, ask the county health department if staff is able to contact trace every case right now—and if they are, ask how many contacts they are able to find, and how isolation and quarantine are going. You might offer support, like food delivery to quarantined people, because it's not just about finding people who may have been exposed; it’s also about helping people quarantine. Stay in close contact with whatever public health entity is leading contact tracing—first to ensure that it's happening and second to be supportive. (Dr. Josh Sharfstein, 4/21/20)
Right now, state leaders are trying to prioritize how to spend the federal stimulus money.

Complete a Social Distancing Protocol for each facility or worksite in the County used by workers or the public,
        using the updated (July 2) version of the template found in the online form. If your
        business does not
        operate a facility or worksite, but provides services to multiple facilities or worksites that your business
        does not own or operate, then you must fill out one Social Distancing Protocol covering your operations.
Sign and submit the completed Protocol to the County using the online form.
Distribute a copy of the Protocol to all workers (employees, volunteers, contractors, etc.) that work at the
        facility or worksite. If your business provides services to multiple facilities or worksites that your business
        does not own or operate, you must distribute the Protocol both to your workers and to the owner or operator of
        each facility or worksite where you provide services. Train your workers on the Protocol measures in a language
        they understand.
Post an updated COVID-19 PREPARED Sign and a Social Distancing Protocol Visitor Information Sheet at all
        entrances to your facility or worksite, where they can be easily viewed by the public and workers. (These
        documents can only be downloaded and printed after you complete your Protocol using the online form.)

A recent paper by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine concluded that “changes in weather alone will not necessarily lead to declines in cases without extensive public health interventions,” citing, among other factors, the current rapid spread of the virus in Australia and Iran and the lack of evidence for seasonality in other serious coronaviruses (those causing SARS and MERS). Even if warmer weather weakens the virus, the lack of immunity in the general population will ensure its continued spread.

Yes, this is possible. If you test negative for COVID-19, you probably were not infected at the time your sample was collected. However, that does not mean you will not get sick. It is possible that you were very early in your infection when your sample was collected and that you could test positive later. Or you could be exposed later and then develop illness.

We are still learning about this new coronavirus and how it spreads. Of the handful of animals confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 in the U.S,  it is believed that all of the animals became sick after contact with infected people. Recent research shows that ferrets, cats, and golden Syrian hamsters can be experimentally infected with the virus and can spread the infection to other animals of the same species in laboratory settings. Pigs, chickens, and ducks did not become infected or spread the infection based on results from these studies. Data from one study suggested dogs are not as likely to become infected with the virus as cats and ferrets. These findings were based off of a small number of animals, and do not indicate whether animals can spread infection to people.
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals may be affected by the virus that causes COVID-19.

High profile international sporting events such as the Olympics or World Cups as well as international religious events such as the Hajj count as mass gatherings. However, lower profile conferences and events can also meet WHO’s definition of a mass gathering. An event counts as a “mass gatherings” if the number of people it brings together is so large that it has the potential to strain the planning and response resources of the health system in the community where it takes place. You need to consider the location and duration of the event as well as the number of participants. For example, if the event takes place over several days in a small island state where the capacity of the health system is quite limited then even an event with just a few thousand participants could place a big strain on the health system and then be considered a “mass gathering” event. Conversely, if the event is held in a big city in a country with a large, well-resourced health system and lasts just a few hours, the event may not constitute a “mass gathering” event. <SEP> How large does a meeting or event need to be in order to be a “mass gathering”? <EOS>

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, and we are still learning about how it spreads and the severity of illness it causes. The virus that causes COVID-19 is believed to spread person-to-person between people who are in close contact (being within about 6 feet) with one another. Some people without symptoms may be able to spread the virus.
The virus likely spreads primarily through saliva or mucus droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. This is somewhat like how the flu (influenza) and other infections such as the common cold spread.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be breathed in. Droplets can remain on surfaces such as countertops and doorknobs for hours to days. <SEP> What is COVID-19? <EOS>
In response to COVID-19, the Department of Human Services and the Division of Developmental Disabilities have:

Temporarily allowing for in-home support or remote delivery of services including cognitive rehabilitation, occupational therapy, physical therapy, and prevocational training. For a full list of services and safety requirements, refer to DDD's temporary service modification memo.
Created a resource guide to assist families in accessing programs and supports.
Suspended in-person visits by Support Coordinators -- however if a family requests an in-person visit from a Support Coordinator and the Support Coordination Agency is in agreement, visits are allowedif PPE is worn and social distancing observed.
Provided flexibility to families to quickly hire workers and worked closely with program providers and direct support professionals during the closure (see this webinar and slide deck for more information).
Released guidance on COVID-19 preparedness for individuals and families of individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities.
Released guidance for community providers of services to the developmentally disabled on COVID-19 preparedness including screening guidelines for visitors and staff in residential settings to protect against the spread of COVID-19.

The Division of Developmental Disabilities regularly publishes information about COVID-19 cases including deaths and numbers of cases by county. That information along with the latest updates from the Division can be found on the Department of Human Services' COVID-19 Updates page.
Revised Guidance During Hospitalization
To better support individuals with disabilities during this public health crisis, in circumstances where support is essential, the Department of Health has made some accommodations during hospitalization.

A designated healthy support person is permitted to be with an individual with a disability during hospitalization. The designated support person may be a family member, personal care assistant or another disability service provider.
Healthy is defined as individuals with no signs of respiratory illness such as fever, cough or shortness of breath. They should not have had contact with anyone with or suspected of having COVID-19 or any respiratory illness and individuals should be wearing the appropriate protective equipment.

Stress, the disruption of social and protective networks, loss of income and decreased access to services all can exacerbate the risk of violence for women. In many countries, where people are encouraged or required to stay at home, the risk of intimate partner violence is likely to increase. Please see the following resource for more detail: https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/emergencies/COVID-19-VAW-full-text.pdf In addition, access to sexual and reproductive health services will likely become more limited. Other services, such as hotlines, crisis centers, shelters, legal aid, and protection services, may also be reduced, making it difficult for women to access the few sources of help that would usually be available. <SEP> How does COVID-19 increase risks of violence for women? <EOS>
The GDOL must determine if you earned enough wages during the base period. The regular base period is the first four of the last five completed calendar quarters at the time you file your claim. If your claim cannot be established using the regular base period, the alternative base period will be used.

Currently, experts do not know exactly how long the virus can stay infectious because it is so new. The World Health Organization's early estimates suggest that COVID-19 virus can survive on hard surfaces for a few hours, or up to several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment). If you think a surface may be infected, clean it with a bleach or alcohol based disinfectant to kill the virus and protect yourself and others. There is no advantage to using antibacterial soap versus regular soap against viruses.

Physical distancing, good personal hygiene with frequent hand washing, and application of general food hygiene measures are the most important precautions food workers should adopt. Physical distancing is very important to help slow the spread of coronavirus. This is achieved by minimising contact between potentially infected individuals and healthy individuals. Frequent hand washing with soap and water and use of hand sanitizers are also important in reducing the risk of transmission. All food businesses should follow the physical distancing and hand washing guidance of WHO.The Codex Alimentarius Commission has adopted several practical guidelines on how to apply and implement best practices to ensure food hygiene (Codex General Principles of Food Hygiene, CXC 1- 1969), handle meats (Codex Code of Hygienic Practice for Meat, CXC 58 – 2005), and control viruses in foods (Guidelines for the Application of General Principles of Food Hygiene to the Control of Viruses in Food (CAC/GL 79-2012). Enhanced food safety practices at this time, such as those recommended in the Codex documents mentioned, will reduce the likelihood of contamination of foods with any pathogen and help lowering the public health burden caused by already established foodborne infections, reducing the stress on an already overburdened public health system. <SEP> What specific precautions do food workers need to take? <EOS>

There are about four strains of coronavirus that cause about 20% of the cases of common cold. However, the COVID-19 virus can cause severe illness because it travels deep into the respiratory tract and infects the lungs. This deep infection can make a person more susceptible for pneumonia. About 80% of the cases of COVID-19 are mild but those with compromised immune systems and the elderly are at greater risk.

There have been some reports of animals infected by coronavirus — including two pets in New York and eight big cats at the Bronx Zoo. 
Most of those infections came from contact with people who had coronavirus, like a zoo employee who was an asymptomatic carrier. 
But according to the CDC, there is no evidence animals play a significant role in spreading the virus to humans. Therefore, at this time, routine testing of animals for Covid-19 is not recommended.
As always, it’s best to wash your hands after touching an animal’s fur and before touching your face. And if your pet appears to be sick, call your veterinarian. <SEP> Could I infect my pets with coronavirus, or vice versa? Can someone get infected by touching an animal’s fur?

Decisions about return to work for healthcare providers (HCPs) with SARS-CoV-2 infection should be made in the context of local circumstances. In general, a symptom-based strategy should be used as described below. The time period used depends on the HCP’s severity of illness and if they are severely immunocompromised.
A test-based strategy is no longer recommended (except as noted below) because, in the majority of cases, it results in excluding from work HCPs who continue to shed detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA but are no longer infectious.
Symptom-based strategy for determining when HCPs can return to work
HCPs with mild to moderate illness who are not severely immunocompromised:

At least 10 days have passed since symptoms first appeared and
At least 24 hours have passed since last fever without the use of fever-reducing medications and
Symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath) have improved

Note:  HCPs who are not severely immunocompromised and were asymptomatic throughout their infection may return to work when at least 10 days have passed since the date of their first positive viral diagnostic test.
HCP with severe to critical illness or who are severely immunocompromised:

At least 10 days and up to 20 days have passed since symptoms first appeared
At least 24 hours have passed since last fever without the use of fever-reducing medications and
Symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath) have improved
Consider consultation with infection control experts

Note:  HCP who are severely immunocompromised but who were asymptomatic throughout their infection may return to work when at least 10 days and up to 20 days have passed since the date of their first positive viral diagnostic test.
As described in the Decision Memo, an estimated 95% of severely or critically ill patients, including some with severe immunocompromise, no longer had replication-competent virus 15 days after onset of symptoms; no patient had replication-competent virus more than 20 days after onset of symptoms. The exact criteria that determine which HCP will shed replication-competent virus for longer periods are not known. Disease severity factors and the presence of immunocompromising conditions should be considered in determining the appropriate duration for specific HCP. For example, HCP with characteristics of severe illness may be most appropriately managed with at least 15 days before return to work.
Test-Based Strategy for Determining when HCPs Can Return to Work
In some instances, a test-based strategy could be considered to allow HCPs to return to work earlier than if the symptom-based strategy were used. However, as described in the CDC’s Decision Memo, many individuals will have prolonged viral shedding, limiting the utility of this approach. A test-based strategy could also be considered for some HCPs (e.g., those who are severely immunocompromised) in consultation with local infectious diseases experts if concerns exist for the HCP being infectious for more than 20 days.
The criteria for the test-based strategy are:
HCPs who are symptomatic:

Resolution of fever without the use of fever-reducing medications and
Improvement in symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath), and
Results are negative from at least two consecutive respiratory specimens collected ≥24 hours apart (total of two negative specimens) tested using an FDA-authorized molecular viral assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA.

See Interim Guidelines for Collecting, Handling, and Testing Clinical Specimens for 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
HCPs who are not symptomatic:

Results are negative from at least two consecutive respiratory specimens collected ≥24 hours apart (total of two negative specimens) tested using an FDA-authorized molecular viral assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA.

NJ Small and Micro Business PPE Access Program
The NJ Small and Micro Business PPE Access Program will help ensure that New Jersey's small businesses and non-profits have access to the fairly priced personal protective equipment (PPE) necessary to facilitate safe working conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Under the Program's first phase, the State will launch a new website that provides micro and small businesses with the information needed to make easier and better PPE sourcing decisions. The website will also offer a vetted list of online retailers that have agreed to verify the quality of the PPE they are selling and offer at least a 10% discount to businesses that enter through the State's website. Online retailers will be vetted on a first-come, first served basis by the NJEDA, and must agree to certain performance standards for their site (e.g., transparent pricing, high-quality products). Vetted online retailers will also be eligible to access an NJEDA grant pool of up to $3.5M to support the purchase of PPE that is manufactured in New Jersey or sourced from a small wholesaler based in a historically underserved community.
Assuming the first phase is successful, the State intends to expand the program with a second phase that will include $11 million in funding to reduce the out-of-pocket cost of PPE purchased by certain small and micro businesses through the pre-selected online PPE retailers (or "Designated Vendors").
Check the PPE Access Program page for more information. Companies interested in becoming a Designated Vendor under the NJ PPE Access Program can apply here.
PPE Supplier Registry
The PPE Supplier Registry connects suppliers of personal protective equipment (PPE) that can prevent the spread of COVID-19 with potential buyers. Wholesale vendors with PPE inventory such as surgical or other protective masks, hospital gowns, hand sanitizer, or COVID-19 test kits can submit details on supplies they have available and hospitals, medical organizations, and private businesses can purchase. The database is updated several times per week, and is easily filtered and sorted by product type, size, payment terms, location of supplier, and several other criteria. The registry is a joint effort by the Office of Governor Murphy, the New Jersey Department of the Treasury, the Office of Emergency Management (OEM), the Office of Innovation, and the New Jersey Economic Development Authority's (NJEDA) Office of Economic Transformation.
Suppliers who wish to be included in the Registry should fill out the PPE Supplier Registry intake form.
NOTE: The information about the vendors and products in this database is provided by the vendors and compiled by the State for the express purpose of assisting private businesses and organizations in New Jersey access potential suppliers for PPE and other COVID-related goods and services. Any other use of this information is prohibited. All parties are strongly advised to exercise due diligence when selecting vendors and are responsible for ensuring the quality and regulatory compliance of all good/services purchased.

Call your doctor if your child has a fever, cough, trouble breathing, sore throat,
               belly pain, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, dizziness, or just doesn't feel well. If your
               child has been near someone with coronavirus or been in an area where lots of people
               have coronavirus, tell the doctor. Talk about whether your child needs a test for
               coronavirus. The doctor can decide whether your child:

can be treated at home
should come in for a visit
can have a video or telehealth visit

In a telehealth visit, a health care provider can see your child on video while
               you stay at home. If you can, choose a telehealth provider who specializes in caring
               for kids. If the doctor thinks your child needs care right away, they will guide you
               on where to go. When possible, check for telehealth in your area before anyone in
               your family is sick.
Watch for signs that your child might need more medical help. Go
               to the ER if your child:

looks very sick to you
has breathing problems. Look for muscles pulling in between the ribs or the nostrils
               puffing out with each breath.
is confused or very sleepy
has chest pain
has cold, sweaty, pale or blotchy skin
is dizzy
has very bad belly pain

COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person, especially between close contacts (people within about 6 feet of each other). When an infected person talks, coughs or sneezes, droplets from their mouth can spread through the air and land in the mouths or noses of nearby people.

 Human coronaviruses were first identified in the mid-1960s. Seven sub-groups are known to infect people, including several that cause the common cold. MERS-CoV (which causes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome), SARS-CoV (which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome), and the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infect animals and have evolved to make people sick. <SEP>  What is coronavirus? <EOS>
The COVID-19 virus primarily spreads when one person breathes in droplets that are produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. In addition, any infected person, with or without symptoms, could spread the virus by touching a surface. The coronavirus could remain on that surface and someone else could touch it and then touch their mouth, nose or eyes. That's why it's so important to try to avoid touching public surfaces or at least try to wipe them with a disinfectant.Social distancing refers to actions taken to stop or slow down the spread of a contagious disease. For an individual, it refers to maintaining enough distance (6 feet or more) between yourself and another person to avoid getting infected or infecting someone else. School closures, directives to work from home, library closings, and cancelling meetings and larger events help enforce social distancing at a community level.Slowing down the rate and number of new coronavirus infections is critical to reduce the risk that large numbers of critically ill patients cannot receive life-saving care. Highly realistic projections show that unless we begin extreme social distancing now — every day matters — our hospitals and other healthcare facilities will not be able to handle the likely influx of patients. <SEP> What is social distancing and why is it important? <EOS>

The State of New Jersey has created a benefits eligibility tool to help you understand what benefits programs and job protections are available to you during the COVID-19 outbreak.
You can also visit nj.gov/labor and read about the state and federal laws and benefit programs that may apply to you. There you will also find a helpful chart clarifying different COVID-19 scenarios and the available protections and benefits in English and Spanish along with steps to apply for benefits.
Programs Available To Help
New Jersey has among the most comprehensive Earned Sick Leave, Temporary Disability and Family Leave Insurance laws in the country, which cover all employees -- full-time, part-time, temporary and seasonal.
In addition, a new federal law passed in response to the coronavirus emergency requires private employers with fewer than 500 employees and most public employers to provide emergency paid sick leave and emergency childcare FMLA leave.
NOTE: NJ Earned Sick Leave, emergency federal paid sick and emergency FMLA childcare leave are paid by your employer directly. Meanwhile, Unemployment, Temporary Disability and Family Leave benefits require an application to the State of NJ. Individuals should apply for the program that best fits their situation as applying for the wrong one could cause delays.
Additional COVID-19 Programs
If you're still employed, you may be eligible for the new federally mandated emergency paid sick leave and emergency FMLA childcare leave.

The Families First Coronavirus Response Act requires private employers with fewer than 500 employees and most public employers to provide emergency paid sick leave and emergency Family and Medical Leave (FMLA) for childcare.
Employers pay their employees for the emergency leave and employers can take advantage of two new refundable payroll tax credits, designed to immediately and fully reimburse employers, dollar-for-dollar, for the cost of providing the leave.
See NJDOL's publication What NJ Workers Need to Know About the Families First Coronavirus Response Act for more details.

If you take family leave, when you return to work, you are generally entitled to return to the same position you held before leave. Your employer may not retaliate against you because you took or attempted to take leave under the NJFLA. To find out more or to file a complaint, go to NJCivilRights.gov or call 973-648-2700.
You may also be eligible for help from Unemployment Insurance. The CARES Act that was signed March 27th has expanded Unemployment benefits, making it the optimal choice for many who cannot work because they, a family member, or a household member have been impacted by coronavirus.
Expansion of Disability and Family Leave Insurance
In New Jersey, Governor Murphy has signed a new law expanding the State's Temporary Disability Insurance (TDI) and Family Leave Insurance (FLI) programs to provide more workers with access to paid leave benefits during public health emergencies.

Individuals can now access TDI and FLI benefits during a public health emergency if they must take time off of work because they are diagnosed with or suspected of exposure to a communicable disease or to take care of a family member diagnosed with or suspected of exposure to a communicable disease.
Individuals accessing FLI benefits are entitled to up to 12 weeks of family leave in a 24-month period without losing their jobs.

Please note that you cannot receive benefits from these programs and Unemployment Insurance at the same time. Learn more about TDI and FLI at myleavebenefits.nj.gov.

Excellent question! We do not currently know if pregnant women have a greater chance of getting sick from COVID-19 than the general public nor whether they are more likely to have serious illness as a result. Pregnant women experience changes in their bodies that may increase their risk of some infections. With viruses from the same family as COVID-19, and other viral respiratory infections, such as influenza, women have had a higher risk of developing severe illness. It is always important for pregnant women to protect themselves from illnesses. The CDC and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists both currently recommend that pregnant women follow the same precautions as others in their communities.

The decision to wear a mask depends on the assessment of risk.
For example, how extensive is COVID-19 in the community? Can the school ensure
physical distance of at least 1 metre from others? Are there students or
teachers with underlying health conditions? 
Fabric masks are recommended to prevent onward
transmission in the general population in public areas, particularly where
distancing is not possible, and in areas of community transmission. This
could include the school grounds in some situations. Masks may help
to protect others, because wearers may
be infected before symptoms of illness appear. The policy on wearing
a mask or face covering should be in line with national or local
guidelines. Where used, masks should be worn, cared for and disposed of properly. 
It is important that
anyone feeling unwell should stay at home and call their health provider. <SEP> Does WHO recommend staff and children to wear masks at school? And if yes, what type of masks? <EOS>
The purpose of the public wearing facemasks is to keep exhaled respiratory droplets from reaching others. Masks with one-way valves or vents allow air to be exhaled through a hole in the material, which can result in expelled respiratory droplets entering the environment and  does not prevent the person wearing the mask from transmitting COVID-19 to others. Therefore, CDC does not recommend using facemasks if they have an exhalation valve or vent. <SEP> Should a mask with a valve or vent be worn to prevent COVID-19 transmission? <EOS>
CDC does not encourage the production and use of homemade hand sanitizer products because of concerns over the correct use of the ingredientsexternal icon and the need to work under sterile conditions to make the product. Local industries that are looking into producing hand sanitizer to fill in for commercial shortages can refer to the World Health Organization guidance.pdf iconexternal icon Organizations should revert to the use of commercially produced, FDA-approved product once such supplies again become available.

To be effective against killing some types of germs, hand sanitizers need to have a strength of at least 60% alcohol and be used when hands are not visibly dirty or greasy.
Do not rely on “Do It Yourself” or “DIY” recipes based solely on essential oils or formulated without correct compounding practices.
Do not use hand sanitizer to disinfect frequently touched surfaces and objects. See CDC’s information for cleaning and sanitizing your home. <SEP> Should I make my own hand sanitizer if I can’t find it in the stores? <EOS>
Some critically ill patients with COVID-19 have been treated with high doses of intravenous (IV) vitamin C in the hope that it will hasten recovery. However, there is no clear or convincing scientific evidence that it works for COVID-19 infections, and it is not a standard part of treatment for this new infection. A study is underway in China to determine if this treatment is useful for patients with severe COVID-19; results are expected in the fall.The idea that high-dose IV vitamin C might help in overwhelming infections is not new. A 2017 study found that high-dose IV vitamin C treatment (along with thiamine and corticosteroids) appeared to prevent deaths among people with sepsis, a form of overwhelming infection causing dangerously low blood pressure and organ failure. Another study published last year assessed the effect of high-dose vitamin C infusions among patients with severe infections who had sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), in which the lungs fill with fluid. While the study's main measures of improvement did not improve within the first four days of vitamin C therapy, there was a lower death rate at 28 days among treated patients. Though neither of these studies looked at vitamin C use in patients with COVID-19, the vitamin therapy was specifically given for sepsis and ARDS, and these are the most common conditions leading to intensive care unit admission, ventilator support, or death among those with severe COVID-19 infections.Regarding prevention, there is no evidence that taking vitamin C will help prevent infection with the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. While standard doses of vitamin C are generally harmless, high doses can cause a number of side effects, including nausea, cramps, and an increased risk of kidney stones. <SEP> I've heard that high-dose vitamin C is being used to treat patients with COVID-19.

 A pandemic is a global outbreak of disease.  Pandemics happen when a new virus emerges to infect people and can spread between people.  Because there is little to no pre-existing immunity against the new virus, it spreads worldwide. The virus that causes COVID-19 is infecting people and spreading easily from person-to-person.  Cases have been detected in most countries worldwide, including the United States, which has recorded cases in all 50 states. <SEP> Q.

Modelling work suggests that if the COVID-19 pandemic led to a global reduction of 25% in expected TB detection for 3 months – a realistic possibility given the levels of disruption in TB services being observed in multiple countries – then we could expect a 13% increase in TB deaths, bringing us back to the levels of TB mortality that we had 5 years ago. This may even be a conservative estimate as it does not factor in other possible impacts of the pandemic on TB transmission, treatment interruptions and poorer outcomes in people with TB and COVID-19 infection (Predicted impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global tuberculosis deaths in 2020, P. Glaziou). Between 2020 and 2025 an additional 1.4 million TB deaths could be registered as a direct consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic (Stop TB Partnership analysis).All measures should be taken to ensure continuity of services for people who need preventive and curative treatment for tuberculosis (TB). <SEP> What is the potential impact of COVID-19 pandemic on essential tuberculosis services? <EOS>

Shortness of breath refers to unexpectedly feeling out of breath, or winded. But when should you worry about shortness of breath? There are many examples of temporary shortness of breath that are not worrisome. For example, if you feel very anxious, it's common to get short of breath and then it goes away when you calm down.However, if you find that you are ever breathing harder or having trouble getting air each time you exert yourself, you always need to call your doctor. That was true before we had the recent outbreak of COVID-19, and it will still be true after it is over.Meanwhile, it's important to remember that if shortness of breath is your only symptom, without a cough or fever, something other than COVID-19 is the likely problem. <SEP> One of the symptoms of COVID-19 is shortness of breath.

The World Health Organization urges everyone to use masks wisely. The CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g. grocery stores and pharmacies) especially in areas of significant community-based transmission. It is critical to emphasize that maintaining 6-feet social distancing remains important in slowing the spread of the virus.  The CDC also advises the use of simple cloth face coverings to slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others. Cloth face coverings fashioned from household items or made from home from common materials at low cost can be used as an additional voluntary public health measure, and these are not surgical masks or N-95 respirators. You may also purchase masks from stores such as Walmart, Amazon, and Target. Surgical masks and N95 respirators continue to be critical supplies reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders as recommended by current CDC guidance. <SEP> Should I wear a mask when I go out? <EOS>

Social distancing means we need to keep our distance from friends, classmates,
               teammates, neighbors, and even people in our family (except the ones we live with).
               That's a big change from the way we normally interact.
And it's not easy. No one wants to be apart from the people they
               like to be with and missing the things they like to do. With all these changes, people
               are missing things they looked forward to, like prom, graduation, tournaments, trips,
               parties, and performances. Or just missing each other. It's a lot to ask, but it's
               also a huge way to help others.
Social distancing is something we can each do to protect lots of people, including
               people we don't know. It's hard, but it's worth it. And it won't last forever. We
               will get back to normal again.

Infographic: Understanding the difference between surgical masks and N95 respiratorspdf icon
N95 respirators reduce the wearer’s exposure to airborne particles, from small particle aerosols to large droplets. N95 respirators are tight-fitting respirators that filter out at least 95% of particles in the air, including large and small particles.
Not everyone is able to wear a respirator due to medical conditions that may be made worse when breathing through a respirator. Before using a respirator or getting fit-tested, workers must have a medical evaluation to make sure that they are able to wear a respirator safely.
Achieving an adequate seal to the face is essential. United States regulations require that workers undergo an annual fit test and conduct a user seal check each time the respirator is used. Workers must pass a fit test to confirm a proper seal before using a respirator in the workplace.
When properly fitted and worn, minimal leakage occurs around edges of the respirator when the user inhales. This means almost all of the air is directed through the filter media.
Unlike NIOSH-approved N95s, facemasks are loose-fitting and provide only barrier protection against droplets, including large respiratory particles. No fit testing or seal check is necessary with facemasks. Most facemasks do not effectively filter small particles from the air and do not prevent leakage around the edge of the mask when the user inhales.
The role of facemasks is for patient source control, to prevent contamination of the surrounding area when a person coughs or sneezes.  Patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 should wear a facemask until they are isolated in a hospital or at home. The patient does not need to wear a facemask while isolated. <SEP> What makes N95 respirators different from facemasks (sometimes called a surgical mask)? <EOS>
As of July 1, private trade schools, career schools, and training schools not overseen by the Office of the Secretary of Higher Education (OSHE) are allowed to resume in-person instruction so long as they follow required social distancing protocols and safety precautions.
Health and safety requirements include, but are not limited to:

Use of face coverings for faculty, staff, students, and visitors, except when doing so would inhibit the individual's health;
Frequent cleaning and sanitization of classrooms, restrooms, high-touch areas and equipment and shared surfaces;
Maintenance of adequate supplies, such as personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies;
Installation of hand sanitizing stations with 60 percent or more alcohol content at all building entry points and throughout the school;
The option of remote instruction for faculty and students who are unable to participate in in-person instruction;
Performance of health screenings for faculty, staff, students and visitors, and education regarding self-monitoring for symptoms;
Social distancing in classrooms, workstations, laboratories, clinical settings, and student seating areas throughout the training school and a plan for providing smaller class sizes if feasible;
Plan for staggering start, break, and end times of class periods, or alternating scheduled class days to reduce crowding at the training school and classroom entryways;
Establishment of COVID-19 testing guidance and contact tracing protocols developed in consultation with local health officials and in line with existing State and federal health privacy statutes and regulations.

Prior to resuming in-person classes, schools must submit their restart plans to the applicable board within the Division of Consumer Affairs.

It’s best not to make unnecessary trips, but if you need to go to a grocery store, it’s important to maintain social and physical distancing as you shop, and to clean your hands often while shopping and as soon as you get home. Here are some other suggestions: 
Have one adult go shopping instead of the whole family, especially since children like to touch objects and then their faces.
Plan to stock up for at least a week so you can minimize the number of trips.
When you’re at the store, stay at least 6 feet away from others.
 Clean the handle of the shopping basket or cart with a disinfectant wipe or alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol. 
Don’t touch your face, and keep your phone in your pocket because it may harbor viruses — use a paper list instead.
Hard surfaces are more likely to be contaminated than soft surfaces (such as fabric), so be mindful of commonly touched surfaces such as payment equipment and self-checkout machines.

Several dogs and cats (domestic cats and tigers) in contact with infected humans have tested positive for COVID-19. In addition, ferrets appear to be susceptible to the infection. In experimental conditions, both cats and ferrets were
                able to transmit infection to other animals of the same species. However, there is no evidence that these animals can transmit the disease to humans and spread COVID-19. COVID-19 is mainly spread through droplets produced when an infected
                person coughs, sneezes, or speaks.Minks raised in farms have also been detected with the virus. Most likely, they have been infected by farm workers. In a few instances, the minks that were infected by humans have transmitted the virus to other people. These are the first
                reported cases of animal-to-human transmission.It is still recommended that people who are sick with COVID-19 and people who are at risk limit contact with companion and other animals. When handling and caring for animals, basic hygiene measures should always be implemented. This includes
                hand washing after handling animals, their food or supplies, as well as avoiding kissing, licking or sharing food.More recommendations are available on the OIE website: https://www.oie.int/en/scientific-expertise/specific-information-and-recommendations/questions-and-answers-on-2019novel-coronavirus/WHO continues to monitor the latest research on this and other COVID-19 topics and will update as new findings are available. <SEP> Can I catch COVID-19 from my pet or other animals? <EOS>
 People are thought to be most contagious (able to spread the virus) when they are symptomatic (the sickest). That is why CDC recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others. More recently, the virus has also been found in persons who do not have symptoms. This is why social distancing, good respiratory hygiene, including good hand washing, and staying at home unless you have to go out for food, supplies, or essential work, are important ways to reduce the spread of this virus. <SEP>  Can a person spread the infection if they don’t feel sick? <EOS>

The Government of Canada has put in place emergency measures that require mandatory 14-day self-isolation for all persons entering Canada, even if they do not have COVID-19 symptoms. Some provinces and territories may have specific recommendations for self-isolation as well. These efforts will help contain the outbreak and limit the spread of COVID-19 in Canada. Employees should refer to COVID-19 travel advice for the most up-to-date information.
If an employee chooses to travel during their vacation, to affected areas contrary to public health advice or government travel advisories while on vacation leave, they may not be entitled to ‘Other Leave with Pay (699)’. They must advise their manager of their intentions as soon as possible. If the location of travel will require the employee to self-isolate upon return, due to Federal government or provincial/territorial guidance, local public health authority guidance, or departmental practice, the option to work remotely should be explored to determine if it is feasible. In cases where remote work is not possible, the employee will be required to use what leave is available to them during the self-isolation period. “Other leave with pay” will not be available for reasons where an employee voluntarily chooses to travel and will be required to self-isolate on return.

Staying at home is difficult and can get boring, but it may help to do something you enjoy. This could be reading a book, playing games or listening to music. Try to stay connected with friends and family every day either by communicating with them by phone or internet if you can, or, if you live close to them and the local rules allow you to, by talking in-person while keeping your distance.  At the same time, it is still really important that you reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by washing your hands with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub  as often as possible, keeping at least 1 metre (3 feet) from other people, and avoiding crowded places. You might be one of the unlucky adolescents who does get severely ill if you catch COVID-19, or you could spread it to others and be responsible for them getting really ill or even dying. You have the power to make choices that could save lives and together young people can play an important part in fighting COVID-19.  Read more:https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public <SEP> I am bored staying home. Since I am very unlikely to get severely ill even if I was to get COVID-19, why is it important that I follow the guidelines to prevent transmission such as keeping physical distance from other people? <EOS>
We need to limit in-person interactions to slow the spread of disease enough to keep our health care system from being overwhelmed. That means keeping enough beds and equipment in place so that hospitals can treat the sickest COVID-19 patients and continue to treat everyone else who has life-threatening conditions. <SEP> Why are we social distancing? <EOS>
Keep your family home until you talk to your doctor. If the doctor thinks your
               child's symptoms could be COVID-19, everyone in the household should stay home until
               testing is done or symptoms are gone. Check the CDC's
               website for details.
Keep other people and pets in the house away from your child as much as possible.
Try to have one person only care for the sick child so others
               are not exposed.
If your child is over 2 years old and can wear a face
               mask or cloth face covering without finding it hard to breathe, have them wear
               one when the caregiver is in the room. Don't leave your child alone while they're
               wearing a mask or cloth face covering. The caregiver also should wear one when in
               the same room. To see how to put on and remove face masks and coverings, clean them,
               or make your own cloth face covering, check the CDC's
               guide.
If possible, have your sick child use a different bathroom from others. If that
               isn't possible, wipe down the bathroom often.
Everyone in your family should wash their
               hands well and often. Wash with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use
               alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
Use regular household cleaners or wipes to clean things that get touched a lot
               (doorknobs, light switches, toys, remote controls, phones, etc.). Do this every day. <SEP> How Can I Keep My Family Safe if My Child Has Symptoms? <EOS>

Try to look at this period of social distancing as an opportunity to get to things you've been meaning to do.Though you shouldn't go to the gym right now, that doesn't mean you can't exercise. Take long walks or run outside (do your best to maintain at least six feet between you and non-family members when you're outside). Do some yoga or other indoor exercise routines when the weather isn't cooperating.Kids need exercise too, so try to get them outside every day for walks or a backyard family soccer game (remember, this isn't the time to invite the neighborhood kids over to play). Avoid public playground structures, which aren't cleaned regularly and can spread the virus.Pull out board games that are gathering dust on your shelves. Have family movie nights. Catch up on books you've been meaning to read, or do a family read-aloud every evening.It's important to stay connected even though we should not do so in person. Keep in touch virtually through phone calls, Skype, video, and other social media. Enjoy a leisurely chat with an old friend you've been meaning to call.If all else fails, go to bed early and get some extra sleep! <SEP> What can I do when social distancing? <EOS>
 As outlined in the Policy for Coronavirus Disease-2019 Tests, the FDA is providing regulatory flexibility for developers that offer validated diagnostic tests while the developers pursue an EUA from the FDA. Tests being offered prior to an EUA under the policies outlined in the FDA's Policy for Coronavirus Disease-2019 Tests have not yet been reviewed by the FDA, are not FDA authorized, and have not received a CLIA categorization or deemed categorization. Therefore, in accordance with CLIA, tests offered under these policies are considered high complexity by default until or unless they are authorized and deemed to be appropriate, through an EUA authorization or general FDA review processes, to be performed as moderate or waived complexity tests.
If you would like to develop and offer a test for use at the point-of-care (POC), please see the Molecular Diagnostic Template for Commercial Manufacturers for recommendations on how to validate the test for this use and submit your EUA request to the FDA. As discussed in the EUA template, an EUA request for a POC test should include data to demonstrate that non-laboratory personnel can perform the test accurately in the intended use environment, as well as data to demonstrate the robustness of the device for near patient testing, i.e., that the device is not sensitive to environmental and usage variation. For assays intended for use with a test system that was previously reviewed and CLIA waived by the FDA, testing is generally only needed to establish the performance of the SARS-CoV-2 assay. If your test system is CLIA waived, please reference the data submitted in a previous CLIA waiver submission in your EUA request (i.e., provide your previous 510(k) or CLIA waiver submission number). In general, since the information provided for the previous CLIA waiver categorization can be leveraged, additional test data may not be needed to demonstrate that the system is simple enough for use at the POC, unless there is a feature of the SARS-CoV-2 assay that would make performing the test more complicated than assays previously cleared for use on the test system.
As discussed in the EUA template, diagnostic POC tests are generally expected to demonstrate positive and negative agreement of ≥ 95%. However, positive agreement of ≥ 80% may be appropriate with appropriate limitations added to the intended use that would mitigate the risk of false negative results. For example, negative results may be considered presumptive negative if the demonstrated PPA is lower than 95%. <SEP>  Does the Policy for Coronavirus Disease-2019 Tests apply to my SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic/screening test for use at the Point-of-Care (POC)?

There are a number of things you can do (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention.html?), including:

Practice good personal hygiene.  This includes:
    
Washing your hands (at least 20 seconds with soap and water) or use a hand sanitizer that is at least 60% alcohol
Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily. This includes tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and surfaces. Clean first, the disinfect.
Using tissues when you cough or sneeze, throwing the tissues away, and washing your hands
Coughing or sneezing into your upper sleeve or elbow, not your hands, if you don’t have a tissue.
Avoiding touching your eyes, nose, and mouth
Avoiding being close to others who are ill or showing symptoms.  Greet people verbally instead of shaking hands or hugging.
Limiting touching frequently touched services in public, e.g. opening doors, pressing elevator buttons, using hand rails, handling menus




Get a flu shot if you didn’t get one earlier.  The flu vaccine won’t protect you from COVID-19, but the flu currently poses a greater threat to the public than COVID-19.
Avoid public activities or areas visited by a large number of people.

Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
Greet people verbally instead of shaking hands or hugging.
Stay at least 6-feet (about 2 arms' length) from other people.
Cover your nose and mouth with a cloth face cover when around other others.


Monitor your health. Watch for symptoms, in yourself and others.
Get the pneumonia vaccine if you’re eligible. It’s recommended for adults 65 and older, all children younger than 2 years, persons 2 through 64with certain health conditions, and adults 19-64 who smoke cigarettes (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/pneumo/index.html)

All individuals dealing with soiled bedding, towels and clothes from patients with COVID-19 should: Wear appropriate personal protective equipment, which includes heavy duty gloves, mask, eye protection (face shield/goggles), long-sleeved gown, apron (if gown is not fluid resistant), boots or closed shoes before touching any soiled linen.Never carry soiled linen against body; place soiled linen in a clearly labelled, leak-proof container (e.g. bag, bucket)If there is any solid excrement on the linen, such as feces or vomit, scrape it off carefully with a flat, firm object and put it in the commode or designated toilet/latrine before putting linen in the designated container. If the latrine is not in the same room as the patient, place soiled excrement in covered bucket to dispose of in the toilet or latrine; Wash and disinfect linen: washing by machine with warm water (60-90°C) and laundry detergent is recommended for cleaning and disinfection of linens. If machine washing is not possible, linen can be soaked in hot water and soap in a large drum, using a stick to stir, avoiding splashing. If hot water not available, soak linen in 0.05% chlorine for approximately 30 minutes.  Finally, rinse with clean water and let linen dry fully in the sunlight.  Additional resources for best practices for environmental cleaning can be found in the following two documents: 1) Infection prevention and control of epidemic-and pandemic prone acute respiratory infections in health care2) Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning in Healthcare Facilities in Resource-Limited Settings which was developed by CDC and ICAN in collaboration with WHO <SEP> How can you clean soiled bedding, towels and linens from patients with COVID-19? <EOS>
While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of mild COVID-19, there are no medicines that have been shown to prevent or cure the disease. WHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19. However, there are several ongoing clinical trials of both western and traditional medicines. WHO is coordinating efforts to develop vaccines and medicines to prevent and treat COVID-19 and will continue to provide updated information as soon as research results become available. <SEP> Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19? <EOS>
In addition to routine approaches to malaria control, there may be a case for special measures in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic – such as a temporary return to presumptive malaria treatment, or the use of mass drug administration – which have proved useful in some previous emergencies. Presumptive malaria treatment refers to treatment of a suspected malaria case without the benefit of diagnostic confirmation (e.g. through a rapid diagnostic test). This approach is typically reserved for extreme circumstances, such as disease in settings where prompt diagnosis is no longer possible.Mass drug administration (MDA) is a WHO-recommended approach for rapidly reducing malaria mortality and morbidity during epidemics and in complex emergency settings. Through MDA, all individuals in a targeted population are given antimalarial medicines – often at repeated intervals – regardless of whether or not they show symptoms of the disease. Such special measures should only be adopted after careful consideration of 2 key aims: lowering malaria-related mortality and keeping health workers and communities safe. WHO is exploring concrete proposals for when and how to activate such measures; guidance will be published in due course. <SEP> What additional special measures may be needed in the context of COVID-19? <EOS>
Sports that require close interaction, are played indoors, and share equipment may pose a greater risk for COVID-19 infection or transmission. The virus spreads mainly from person-to-person among other ways. The more people a player or coach interacts with, the closer the physical interaction, the more sharing of equipment there is by multiple players, and the longer the interaction, the higher the risk of COVID-19 spread.
To determine which sports are safer to play during the COVID-19 pandemic, consider the following:

Physical closeness of players during play
Amount of necessary touching of shared equipment and gear
Ability to engage in social distancing while not actively engaged in play such as when on the bench or sideline
Age of the player and their ability to comply with social distancing and other protective actions
Size of the team and field of play
Presence of nonessential visitors, spectators, volunteers during practices or games
Travel required outside of the local community

Sports that require frequent closeness or contact between players may make it more difficult to maintain social distancing and therefore may present increased risk for COVID-19 spread. For close-contact sports like wrestling or basketball, play may be modified to safely increase distance between players.

For example:

Coaches and players can focus on individual skill building or conditioning instead of competition;
Coaches can limit close or full contact (such as tackling, checking or guarding) to competitions or game-like situations (such as scrimmages) or limit the number of participants involved in close or full contact situations;
Leagues can decrease the number of competitions during a season.



For sports that are normally played indoors such as hockey and gymnastics, coaches can focus on individual skill building or conditioning in lieu of team-based practice, limit the number of players or athletes in the facility at one time so they can space out by at least 6 feet, or conduct modified practices outdoors.

Some people are more likely to get very sick from coronavirus. This includes people
               with health problems, such as asthma,
               diabetes, or a weak immune
               system, and adults age 65 or older. Babies younger than 12 months old might get
               sicker from coronavirus than older kids.
If your child has a health problem or lives with someone in a high-risk group,
               weigh the risk of your child bringing germs home
               from the classroom. Many families with high-risk members may opt for distance learning.
               Your doctor can help you decide. <SEP> What if My Child or Family Member Is in a High-Risk Group? <EOS>
Not necessarily. More severe cases require hospitalization. However, most people who contract COVID-19 can stay in their homes, as long as they self-isolate. Your doctor will let you know if you can go home or if you need to be hospitalized. Either way, you will need to be quarantined so you won’t spread the virus. 

Your state public health department will tell you when it’s okay for you to leave quarantine. They’ll track you throughout your recovery to make sure you’re getting better and aren’t exposing others to the virus.
You may need to go to the hospital if you need a ventilator to help you breathe. Hospitals can also supply you with extra oxygen, which makes it easier for you to breathe on your own.
If you feel more comfortable staying in the hospital than going home, let your doctor know. For example, you might be concerned about spreading the disease to your family if you return home.
Continue to monitor your symptoms if you're staying at home. If your symptoms become more severe, call your doctor as soon as possible. <SEP> Do you have to stay in the hospital if you have COVID-19? <EOS>
The onset and duration of viral shedding and the period of infectiousness for COVID-19 are not yet known with certainty. Based on current evidence, scientists believe that persons with mild to moderate COVID-19 may shed replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 for up to 10 days following symptom onset, while a small fraction of persons with severe COVID-19, including immunocompromised persons, may shed replication-competent virus for up to 20 days. It is possible that SARS-CoV-2 RNA may be detectable in the upper or lower respiratory tract for weeks after illness onset, similar to infections with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. However, detection of viral RNA does not necessarily mean that infectious virus is present. Based on existing literature, the incubation period (the time from exposure to development of symptoms) of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses (e.g., MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV) ranges from 2–14 days. <SEP> When is someone infectious? <EOS>
Older people (≥65 years of age) and persons living in a nursing home or long-term care facility are at greater risk for serious illness.
People of any age with the following conditions are at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19:

Cancer
Chronic kidney disease
COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)
Immunocompromised state (weakened immune system) from solid organ transplant
Obesity (body mass index [BMI] of 30 or higher)
Serious heart conditions, such as heart failure, coronary artery disease, or cardiomyopathies
Sickle cell disease
Type 2 diabetes mellitus

COVID-19 is a new disease. Currently there are limited data and information about the impact of underlying medical conditions and whether they increase the risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Based on what we know at this time, people with the following conditions might be at an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19:

Asthma (moderate-to-severe)
Cerebrovascular disease (affects blood vessels and blood supply to the brain)
Cystic fibrosis
Hypertension or high blood pressure
Immunocompromised state (weakened immune system) from blood or bone marrow transplant, immune deficiencies, HIV, use of corticosteroids, or use of other immune weakening medicines
Neurologic conditions, such as dementia
Liver disease
Pregnancy
Pulmonary fibrosis (having damaged or scarred lung tissues)
Smoking
Thalassemia (a type of blood disorder)
Type 1 diabetes mellitus

Indoor Shopping Malls
On Monday, June 29, the indoor portions of retail shopping malls may reopen so long as they follow the required social distancing and safety guidelines.
Retail businesses located in the interior of shopping malls are permitted to reopen to the public, as long as they comply with the requirements for retail businesses outlined above.
Retail kiosks located within malls may open and must also follow the same mitigation requirements for retail businesses and must also ensure customers remain six feet apart at all times.
Restaurants within the interior of a retail shopping mall may offer takeout and delivery services as well as in-person outdoor dining in areas outside of the mall, where feasible and in accordance with mitigation requirements for all restaurants.
Valet parking, vending machines, stroller rentals, and communal play areas shall be closed at all indoor shopping malls.
Indoor entertainment and recreation businesses, like movie theaters, gyms, and water parks, located within malls will remain closed as they do across the state. However, arcades may reopen at 25 percent capacity so long as they follow required social distancing and safety guidelines. For a full list of safety requirements, refer to sections 7 of page 13 of Executive Order No. 157 and the Department of Health's Executive Directive 20-023.
Additional requirements for malls include:

All areas with communal seating shall be removed or cordoned off. Isolated seats or benches available for individual use may be accessible, in order to provide customers with a place to rest.
Indoor shopping mall operators should evaluate floor plans and establish policies to minimize congestion points and maintain social distancing, such as a customer flow plan with floor markings or separate entrance and exit points.
With respect to the mall's own employees, mall operators must require infection control practices, provide employees break time for handwashing, and provide sanitization materials, among other requirements.
Employees and customers must wear face coverings while on the premises, except where doing so would inhibit that individual's health or where the individual is under two years of age. If a customer refuses to wear a cloth face covering for non-medical reasons and if such covering cannot be provided to the individual by the mall at the point of entry, then the mall must decline entry to the individual.

For a full list of mitigation requirements, refer to Administrative Order No. 2020-16.

The priority of students who will restart training will be based on several factors, the first of which is the sequencing of those who were part way through their training. Next will be those who had not yet commenced their training. The CAF will remain flexible and deliberate as every restart plan is conditions based. If the right conditions are not in place (e.g. known safety protocols in place, all receive training, PPE issued to all trainees and trainers, principal restrictions lifted) then we will re-assess our plans and, if we cannot mitigate safety concerns, then it will not happen. <SEP> When will trades training resume? <EOS>
Outdoor areas generally require normal routine cleaning and do not require disinfection. Spraying disinfectant on outdoor playgrounds is not an efficient use of disinfectant supplies and has not been proven to reduce the risk of COVID-19 to the public. You should maintain existing cleaning and hygiene practices for outdoor areas. If practical, high touch surfaces made of plastic or metal, such as grab bars and railings, should be cleaned routinely. Cleaning and disinfection of wooden surfaces (e.g., play structures, benches, tables) or groundcovers (e.g., mulch, sand) is not recommended. <SEP> Should outdoor playgrounds, like those at schools or in parks, be cleaned and disinfected to prevent COVID-19? <EOS>
Here’s the short answer: Everything is moving quickly. The only things we can say with confidence are that nothing is certain, and that many more Americans are likely to die before this is over. 
There are a few big questions to follow. 
First, will the virus return in full force with the cold weather? There has been some speculation as to whether warm weather has had an effect on slowing the virus. So far, we do know that you are safer outside, provided you wear a mask and stay far apart from other people. When winter comes, it will be harder to spend time outside, especially if you are in a cold climate. If you do need to move inside, only spend time in places with good ventilation, as the virus seems to hang in the air for hours. But be prepared in case of another spike in cases where you live.
Second, what’s the deal with schools? We have a section on this below, but expect significant disruption. Some elementary through high school students will be in classrooms part-time or not at all. Others might be going back to school like normal, but they could be in greater danger of sudden outbreaks and shutdowns. 
Some colleges, including California State University, have announced that they will reopen in the fall, but with most classes moved online. Others are trying to limit the term length. Some professors are rebelling against in-person teaching. Everything is basically on a “pencil it in, pending an outbreak” basis. 
And third, what about work? Some non-essential workers are already back in offices and others will soon be returning to plexiglass dividers and alternating schedules, even though cases continue to rise. For many companies, however, the return-to-office date keeps getting pushed out later and later. We have more information about this below, but as an employee, you have some rights. That choice might be made for you, though. <SEP> What will the world look like in a few months? <EOS>
You should contact your local school district to check on the process for certifying employment certificates or "working papers".
Executive Order 135 allows minors seeking to certify working papers with school district issuing officers to do so through videoconference, in place of in-person contact. Individual school districts will craft procedures that satisfy the statutory requirements.

A face covering does not need to be worn by a worker, customer or patron who meets one of the following exceptions:
Should not wear a face covering due to any medical or behavioral condition or disability (including, but not limited to any person who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious or incapacitated, or is otherwise unable to put on or remove the face covering without assistance)
Is under 11 years of age
Is actively eating or drinking
Is strenuously exercising
Is seeking to communicate with someone who is hearing impaired in a way that requires the mouth to be visible
Is giving a speech for a broadcast or to an audience
Is working at home or is in a personal vehicle
Is temporarily removing his or her face covering to secure government or medical services or for identification purposes
Would be at risk from wearing a face covering at work, as determined by local, state or federal regulators or workplace safety guidelines
Has found that their face covering is impeding visibility to operate equipment or a vehicle
Is a child whose parent, guardian or responsible person has been unable to place the face covering safely on the child’s face

The COVID-19 virus was not designed in a laboratory. The COVID-19 virus is most closely related (96% identical) to a coronavirus that was previously identified in bats. Scientists are working around the clock to determine which animal was the original host of COVID-19 and which mutations the virus obtained that enabled it to infect humans. The suggestion that the virus was created in a lab has been debunked and retracted.

No. There is no evidence that adding hot peppers to your food can prevent or cure COVID-19. <SEP> Can adding pepper to your soup or other meals help prevent or cure COVID-19? <EOS>
There is no specific treatment or vaccine for this disease.
Healthcare providers are mostly using a symptomatic approach, meaning they treat the symptoms rather than target the virus, and provide supportive care (e.g. oxygen therapy, fluid management) for infected persons, which can be highly effective.
In severe and critically ill patients, a number of drugs are being tried to target the virus, but the use of these need to be more carefully assessed in randomised controlled trials. Several clinical trials are ongoing to assess their effectiveness but results are not yet available.
As this is a new virus, no vaccine is currently available. Although work on a vaccine has already started by several research groups and pharmaceutical companies worldwide, it may be many months or even more than a year before a vaccine has been tested and is ready for use in humans. <SEP> 5. Is there a treatment for the COVID-19 disease? <EOS>
Children need to develop a toolkit of coping techniques to deal with distress and anxiety. These are some ways to support them:

Talk to kids. Sharing feelings with someone who cares can be helpful.
Write about feelings or use art to express emotions.
Use mindfulness to focus and keep calm. These techniques can be learned by children.
Exercise at home or in your own yard.

Parents often try to protect children, but the bottom line is that kids need to learn how to take ownership for their own health—and that can start at a young age. Adults should resist the temptation to simply tell children exactly what to do. Grown-ups can tell kids what's important to do, then let them figure out how they wish to do it. With very young children, it may be that they get to pick which soap they're going to use to wash their hands, or which song to sing while washing their hands. Let kids take responsibility for themselves to the extent that they can manage and that's developmentally appropriate. <SEP> Can you describe some coping techniques kids and parents can use? <EOS>
Getting plenty of rest, drinking fluids, eating healthy foods, and managing your stress may help you prevent getting COVID-19 and recover from it if you do.
If you smoke or vape, consider trying to quit. People who smoke may be more likely to develop serious health complications from COVID-19. Smoking weakens the immune system, making it harder for your body to fight off viral infections. Initial findings suggest that vaping may increase lung inflammation and exacerbate lung infections. Need help quitting? Call 1-800-QUIT-NOW or visit our How To Quit webpage.
Watch your children for symptoms of COVID-19. If your child shows symptoms of COVID-19, separate them from others immediately. If they have been at a child care center recently, notify the center.
Set up a separate room for sick household members. Clean the room regularly and make sure they have clean disposable facemasks to use. (Check out our “Information for families caregiving for loved ones” on our COVID-19 Educational Materials page for more information on what to do if you do not have access to facemasks.)
Check in with family and friends who live alone—especially those with chronic diseases. If you live alone, ask your friends and family to check in with you if you become sick.
Stay connected to your loved ones over the phone, via text messages, email, or using video chat programs.
Check out the resources on our Resources and Recommendations webpage under “Mental Health and Personal Impact.” <SEP> How can I take care of myself and loved ones during this time? <EOS>

No, it is not safe to go on a cruise. Cruises put large numbers of people, often from countries around the world, in frequent and close contact with each other. 
Sustained community spread of COVID-19 has been associated with several recent cruise events. In addition, those traveling by ship may be impacted by travel restrictions affecting their itineraries or ability to disembark, or may be subject to quarantine procedures implemented by the local authorities.
The CDC has implemented a No Sail Order for cruise ships effective March 14, 2020, lasting for the next 30 days. <SEP> Is it safe to go on a cruise? <EOS>
Not all patients with COVID-19 will require medical supportive care. Clinical management for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is focused on supportive care of complications, including advanced organ support for respiratory failure, septic shock, and multi-organ failure. Empiric testing and treatment for other viral or bacterial etiologies may be warranted.
Corticosteroids are not routinely recommended for viral pneumonia or ARDS and should be avoided unless they are indicated for another reason (e.g., COPD exacerbation, refractory septic shock following Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines).
Additional information is available in CDC’s Interim Clinical Guidance for Management of Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). <SEP> What type of supportive treatment is recommended for COVID-19 patients? <EOS>
Spread of the COVID-19 virus makes visiting the gym, and all social interactions, riskier. Many facilities have already shut down and more and more localities are taking steps to limit social interactions.
Harvard Medical School experts recommend that everyone begin intensive social distancing immediately, limiting contact with people outside your family as much as possible. This protects both you and those in your communities who are at higher risk of severe medical complications from COVID-19. Basically, we need to end any nonessential activities that involve close contact with others to prevent spread of the disease.
If you need to go out to get food, staples, medications, or healthcare, try to stay at least six feet away from others, and wash your hands thoroughly after the trip, avoiding contact with your face and mouth throughout. Prepare your own food rather than going to a restaurant or even getting takeout.
Again, it's best to avoid the gym; but if you do go, be sure to wipe down anything you are about to touch, and once more after you use the equipment. Try to keep a distance of 6 feet or more from others.

That depends on the college or college system, and is still pretty up in the air. College is, by its nature, not a socially distant period of life. Dorm living is close; shared bathrooms are closer. So much you do for fun in college is predicated on touch. 
Still, more than three-quarters of colleges and universities have decided students can return to campus this fall, to attend in-class and remote studies. But many professors are concerned about coming in to teach. Their students are at lower risk of getting seriously ill from the virus, and are probably taking many more risks outside the classroom.
“Until there’s a vaccine, I’m not setting foot on campus,” said Dana Ward, 70, an emeritus professor of political studies at Pitzer College in Claremont, Calif., who teaches a class in anarchist history and thought.
Administrators are trying for creative solutions. Calendars are changing: Campuses across the country are forgoing fall break to zip through academic work and get students home before Thanksgiving. Or, they’re allowing only some of their students back to campus. In order to achieve social distancing, many colleges are saying they will allow 40 to 60 percent of their students to return to campus and live in the residence halls at any one time, often divided by class year.
Sports are also a big question mark. College football is teetering and the Ivy League has suspended all sports until January. Expect more leagues to follow. <SEP> What about colleges? <EOS>
Yes. Recipients may submit extension requests to the funding IC for consideration when the effects of COVID-19 have altered the planned course of the research training.

Yes, managers can. 
The Society for Human Resource Management recommends companies “actively encourage sick employees to stay home, send symptomatic employees home until they are able to return to work safely, and require employees returning from high-risk areas to telework during the incubation period [of 14 days].”

In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness — many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome — which caused their blood oxygen levels to plummet — and received supplemental oxygen. In severe cases, they were placed on ventilators to help them breathe.
By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. (And some people don’t show many symptoms at all.) In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed.
Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one’s sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe” — but few other serious symptoms.
More serious cases can lead to inflammation and organ damage, even without difficulty breathing. There have been cases of dangerous blood clots, strokes and brain impairments. <SEP> What does the virus do to my body? <EOS>

WHO recommends the following set of measures to prevent person-to-person spread  of COVID-19 Limit close contact between infectious people and others. Ensure a physical distance of at least 1 metre from others.  In areas where COVID-19 is circulating and this distance cannot be guaranteed, wear a mask.Identify infected people quickly so that they can be isolated and cared for and all of their close contacts can be quarantined in appropriate facilities. Clean hands and cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue or bent elbow at all times.Avoid crowded places, close-contact settings and confined and enclosed spaces with poor ventilation. Ensure good ventilation in indoor settings, including homes and offices.   Stay home if feeling unwell and call your medical provider as soon as possible to determine whether medical care is needed.In countries or areas where COVID-19 is circulating, health workers should use medical masks continuously during all routine activities in clinical areas in health care facilities. Health workers should also use additional personal protective equipment and precautions when caring for COVID-19 patients. More details for medical professionals are available here and here.

It is important to continue with any medication you may be using for chronic and other conditions, such as asthma, diabetes, HIV infection and TB, and attend recommended check-ups.  Check with your health authorities and health provider if these check-ups should be done differently during the COVID-19 outbreak. Some services, such as counselling, may be available remotely. For treatment of clinically stable adolescents with HIV and adolescents with TB and/or other chronic conditions, your health provider should consider multi-month prescriptions and dispensing which will reduce the frequency of your visits to the clinic and ensure continuity of treatment, if movements are disrupted during the pandemic.  Adherence to treatment is just as important during this period.   Read more:https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-on-covid-19-hiv-and-antiretrovirals <SEP> I am on medication for a chronic health condition.

 COVID-19 is a new disease and we are learning more about it every day.  Older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions may be at higher risk for more serious complications from COVID-19.  Based upon available information to date, the CDC has said those most at risk include:
People 65 years and older
People who live in a nursing home or long-term care facility
People who are pregnant
People of any age with the following underlying medical conditions, particularly those that are not well controlled:
Chronic lung disease or asthma
Congestive hear failure or coronary artery disease
Diabetes
Neurologic conditions that weaken the ability to cough
Weakened immune system
Chemotherapy radiation for cancer (currently or in recent past)
Sickle cell anemia

No. The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults. However, children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally presented with mild symptoms. Reported symptoms in children include cold-like symptoms, such as fever, runny nose, and cough. Vomiting and diarrhea have also been reported. It’s not known yet whether some children may be at higher risk for severe illness, for example, children with underlying medical conditions and special healthcare needs. There is much more to be learned about how the disease impacts children. <SEP> Are the symptoms of COVID-19 different in children than in adults? <EOS>
 AHCCCS policies AMPM 1240-G (Home Health Services) and AMPM 320-O (BH Services and Treatment/Service Planning) outline requirements for care and service delivery by LPNs or BHTs, which includes supervision by appropriate professional staff.

Make sure public health measures such as frequent hand washing for at least 20 seconds is observed. <SEP> Will employees be able to clean their workspace with cleaning products although they are scented? <EOS>
Employers and staff should discuss and agree working arrangements.
Employers should decide, in consultation with their employees, whether it is viable for them to continue working from home. Where it is decided that workers should come into their place of work then this will need to be reflected in the risk assessment and actions taken to manage the risks of transmission in line with this guidance.
It is at the discretion of employers as to how staff can continue working safely. Working from home is one way to do this, but workplaces can also be made safe by following COVID-19 Secure guidelines. Your employer should consult with you on how you can work safely, and must ensure workplaces are safe if they are asking you to return, as above.
If you remain concerned that your employer is not taking all practical steps to promote social distancing then you can report this to your local authority or the Health and Safety Executive who can take a range of action, including where appropriate requiring your employer to take additional steps. <SEP> 6.1 My employer is asking me to come to work but I’m scared. <EOS>

Some companies hope to start testing for effectiveness this spring, which is a very aggressive timeline. The idea is that there could be some preliminary data, even at the end of spring or into summer.
We don’t know yet if we will have something that can work or not. It's not easy to make a vaccine in large quantities; it can take months to scale it up. And this is a vaccine for everybody. You have to be sure that it's safe. 
Those initial studies are going to involve maybe a thousand people, but you’re talking about a vaccine for billions. There's a lot of science still to be done to feel confident. But things are happening, and in some cases faster than anticipated.
Also, we’re going to have another flu season this fall. There will be flu vaccine. Any planning you do around a robust vaccine response for COVID-19 is good to do for flu as well, as it will reduce pressure on the health care system and save lives. In an average flu year, we wind up getting about half the people vaccinated, but this is the year to aim much, much higher. Start thinking about a team to work with all the partners to make that happen, and that will make the fall a lot easier and definitely save lives. (Dr. Josh Sharfstein, 5/5/20)
As we enter the opening up phase of this recovery, you're going to see various “quick fixes” being touted. We’re starting to hear good news about treatments and vaccines, but none of them will happen tomorrow—if in fact they’re any good. 
Many of you will be opening up without the testing that you wish you had, and it’s important that you communicate that this is exceptionally risky, and you will need to use all avenues of communication to remind people what works against the virus—social distancing, masks, and other behaviors that keep us physically apart as much as possible.
The challenge for all of you and especially for the states will be the distribution system for a vaccine, so get familiar with your distribution protocols: e.g., points of distribution (PODs), working with the state, and more. Obviously first responders and health care workers go first with a vaccine, but questions about who goes second, third, fourth, and last are not at all clear yet.

Health care providers themselves don't do the tests for COVID-19; they are done at medical laboratories. A health care provider or nurseline can help you by discussing with you whether you need to be tested and giving information about where to go to get tested.

You will get your test results from the healthcare professional or facility that collected your specimens. Ask your healthcare provider, when they collect your specimen, what the best way to get your results is. Most clinics and health care professionals are providing results by telephone.
While VDH does receive COVID-19 test results from private labs, including both positive and negative results, the best way to know how you will get your results is to talk with your healthcare provider. <SEP> After testing, how will I get my test results? <EOS>
Before you talk to your children, it’s important to understand your own anxiety and keep it in check. If your child is worried about the coronavirus, listen to him or her, rather than respond with comments like, “It’ll be fine.” Dismissive reactions can make children feel like they’re not being heard, said Abi Gewirtz, a clinical psychologist and professor at the University of Minnesota.
Talking about the pandemic and its impact may help avoid the harmful effects of stress. Help your kids understand that there are things they can do to help others — like staying home whenever possible and wearing a mask when they go out. Kids feel good when they know they are helping solve a problem.
Also, avoid making assumptions. While we may be struggling with schools being closed, kids could be rejoicing in it. We might assume our kids miss their friends, but they may appreciate having more time with us. And some who were dealing with bullying or social challenges at school may be relieved to not have to see other kids. <SEP> How should I explain this to my kids? How is their mental health? <EOS>

We do not anticipate that food products would need to be recalled or be withdrawn from the market because of COVID-19, as there is currently no evidence to support the transmission of COVID-19 associated with food or food packaging.
Additionally, facilities are required to control any risks that might be associated with workers who are ill regardless of the type of virus or bacteria. For example, facilities are required to maintain clean and sanitized facilities and food contact surfaces. <SEP> Do I need to recall food products produced in the facility during the time that the worker was potentially shedding virus while working?

PHMs are behaviors and actions that are taken by an individual or non-medical grade equipment that is worn by an individual in the course of their normal activities in the Defence Team workplace and in the community to protect themselves and others. PHMs reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19 infection and will be the principal measures required for most CAF members, DND staff members and contractors in the vast majority of circumstances. Examples of PHMs include the donning of non-medical masks in combination with maintaining physical distancing, practicing cough and sneeze etiquette (cough and sneeze into a tissue or the bend of your arm), frequent and thorough hand washing with soapy water, etc.
Conversely, PPE is medical grade equipment primarily designed to protect the wearer from COVID-19 infection when performing tasks/duties that may bring them in close contact with carriers or suspected carriers of the disease. This in turn places that individual at a higher risk of exposure to COVID-19, hence the requirement to wear medical grade PPE. Medical grade PPE also protects others who are in close proximity to the wearer from possible COVID-19 inflection. Examples would be situations where first responders and frontline medical personnel are in close contact with infected persons and/or their belongings. PPE is to be used in conjunction with appropriate PHMs. 
A clear understanding of PHMs and PPE is of critical importance to help protect the health and safety of Defence Team personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic. Equally important is knowing which situations demand the use of medical grade PPE in conjunction with PHMs vice the use of PHMs alone as this determination is based on types of employment and potential risks associated with proximity and frequency of possible COVID-19 exposure. This is to ensure that Defence Team personnel receive the proper protection necessary and appropriate under the circumstances while reserving the use of medical grade PPE for situations and personnel that truly require it. <SEP> What is the difference between PHMs and PPE? Why is it important to make the distinction between the two terms? <EOS>
We base eligibility for VA health care on several factors, like your military service, discharge status, and whether you have a service-connected disability.
If you've lost your job or have a reduced income, you may qualify for enhanced eligibility status based on your income. This means we'll place you in a higher priority group, which makes you more likely to get benefits and affects how much (if anything) you'll need to pay for care.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recommends that healthcare workers use a combination of standard procedures to protect themselves, including wearing gowns, gloves, eye/face protection, and respirators that provide protection against breathing in contaminated air. However, this respirator mask is not suitable for children, people with facial hair, and those with respiratory conditions such as asthma. See the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health's guidelines for the types of respirators that should be used.

“Viruses can live on surfaces and objects — including on money — although your chance of actually getting COVID-19 from cash is probably very low,” emergency room physician Dr. Leana Wen said.
The new coronavirus can live for up to 72 hours on stainless steel and plastic, up to 24 hours after landing on cardboard, and up to four hours after landing on copper, according to a study funded by the US National Institutes of Health. 
So how do you protect yourself? To avoid touching cash or coins, use contactless methods of payment whenever possible, Wen said.
If you can’t use a contactless form of payment, credit cards and debit cards are much easier to clean and disinfect than cash. But remember that anyone who touches your credit card can also leave germs on it.
If you must use cash, “wash your hands well with soap and water” afterward, Wen said. 
The same applies for anything else you touch that might have coronavirus on it. If you can’t wash your hands immediately, use hand sanitzier or disinfectant.
And since Covid-19 is a respiratory disease, make sure you avoid touching your face. <SEP> Can you get coronavirus from touching money? What about from other objects, like plants? <EOS>
Mayors should ensure that mental health remains on city agendas. Cities should plan for a mental health demand surge 2-4 months from now and begin mapping out a plan to ensure coordination across city agencies and nonprofit partners. This coordination should result in continuously updated information for residents and programmatic intent (e.g. that cities identify priority areas to address through messaging, sponsoring innovation, and developing partnerships).

Public health systems across the country use epidemiological death data to rapidly classify and count cases and deaths consistently. The vital records death data, which accounts for deaths caused by COVID-19, take much longer to obtain.
The Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists set a national standardized case definition for counting COVID-19 deaths for epidemiological purposes, and the CDC approved it. The case definition includes both confirmed and probable case deaths:
	A death is classified as a confirmed case if the case had a positive COVID-19 lab test.
A death is classified as a probable case if the case meets the probable case definition or the death certificate lists “COVID-19” or an equivalent as a cause of death, but it does not have a positive lab test. <SEP> Why do you report epidemiological death data?

First, call the health care team. They know your child's health history. The doctor
               will ask how your child is doing and if they've been around someone with known or
               suspected coronavirus. Your doctor's office will tell you what to do next and whether
               you need an in-person visit.
Experts suggest using inhalers for someone who is sick instead of nebulizers
               when possible during the COVID-19 crisis. That's because nebulizers create a mist.
               If someone has the coronavirus and uses a nebulizer, the mist could carry the virus
               to others. If your child uses a nebulizer treatment, talk
               to your care team about whether your child should switch to an inhaler.
If your child can't use an inhaler, try not to have others in the room when using
               the nebulizer. Open a window or do the nebulizer on a porch for better air circulation.
               If you need to help your child use the nebulizer, stay behind them (not in front)
               during the treatment. <SEP> What if My Child Gets Sick? Could It Be COVID-19? <EOS>
You can take steps to lower your risk of getting infected in the first place:
As much as possible, limit contact with people outside your family.
Maintain enough distance (six feet or more) between yourself and anyone outside your family.
Wash your hands often with soap and warm water for 20 to 30 seconds.
As best you can, avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth.
Stay away from people who are sick.
During a COVID-19 outbreak in your community, stay home as much as possible to further reduce your risk of being exposed.
Clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces in your home, such as counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables, every day.
In addition, do your best to keep your condition well-controlled. That means following your doctor's recommendations including taking medications as directed. If possible, get a 90-day supply of your prescription medications and request that they be mailed to you so you don't have to go to the pharmacy to pick them up.Call your doctor for additional advice specific to your condition. <SEP> I have a chronic medical condition that puts me at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19, even though I'm only in my 30s.

The Center for Disease Control has published communication resources that include social media resources, guidance documents, print resources, images, and videos on topics including symptoms and testing, sickness prevention, daily life and coping, and at-risk populations. States such as Pennsylvania and Texas have also developed their own social media kits that highlight virus related information for the public.
Several elected officials have also partnered with celebrities, who can be more influential among teens and other hard-to-reach populations than politicians or health officials, as part of their COVID-19 communication strategies. California Governor Gavin Newsom, for instance, has tweeted videos of comedian Larry David and rapper Snoop Dog to reinforce his social distancing policies. Sharing these messages or developing new ones with well known local residents may be a way to extend your reach – although you should make sure these messages are accurate, scientifically sound, and correlate with those of the public health community and your own administration.

Anyone who comes into close contact with someone who has COVID-19 is at increased risk of becoming infected themselves, and of potentially infecting others. Contact tracing can help prevent further transmission of the virus by quickly identifying and informing people who may be infected and contagious, so they can take steps to not infect others.Contact tracing begins with identifying everyone that a person recently diagnosed with COVID-19 has been in contact with since they became contagious. In the case of COVID-19, a person may be contagious 48 to 72 hours before they started to experience symptoms.The contacts are notified about their exposure.

All persons taken into custody should be given a facemask or cloth face covering to wear as part of universal source control. A facemask or cloth face covering may help protect others nearby if these people are infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.
If a person taken into custody exhibits signs and symptoms of COVID-19 (cough, fever, or shortness of breath), the person should be assessed for transport to a healthcare facility for further evaluation and management. Medical evaluation during intake processing may be necessary, especially if COVID-19 is suspected. If, at any point, it is determined that the person taken into custody needs medical care, transportation should be coordinated with EMS providers and the receiving healthcare facility.

There is currently no vaccine to prevent COVID-19. The best way to prevent infection is to avoid being exposed. Take the following precautions to avoid exposure:

Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, you can use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
Clean and disinfect frequently-touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash and wash your hands.
Stay home when you are sick.
When you must go out, practice social distancing. <SEP> How can I help protect myself? <EOS>
No. Employers may choose to designate screeners to conduct in-person screenings, but they may also choose to have
    employees self-certify in writing that they have no symptoms. This may be done through a paper form, an online

If you have traveled to an area where COVID-19 is spreading in the community or if you have been in close contact with a person with COVID-19, you should take your temperature twice daily and remain alert for signs of illness, including fever, cough, chills, muscle or body aches, headache, sore throat, new loss of taste or smell, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, runny nose, nausea or vomiting and diarrhea. It is important to not eat, drink, or exercise for at least 30 minutes before taking your temperature.
If you develop mild illness, it is important to stay home and rest. It is very important that people with even mild signs of illness (fever, cough, chills, shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat) stay home to prevent spreading illness to others! <SEP> How do I monitor my health at home if I believe I have been exposed to COVID-19? <EOS>
Whether shower facilities are or will be available at your work location will be dependent upon local conditions/restrictions.

PPE should be put on outside of the structure before entry.
Minimum PPE should include:

A single pair of non-sterile disposable medical examination gloves, but if the investigator determines that there is a risk of cuts, tears, punctures, abrasions, or hazards that could penetrate the skin, heavy-duty tear-resistant gloves should be worn over the examination gloves.
Eye protection, such as goggles or face shield that covers the front and sides of the face.
Clean, long-sleeved, fluid-resistant or impermeable isolation gown for barrier protection of skin and clothing.
Shoe coverings with non-slip tread.
Disposable facemask. However, if family members are going to be in the home and in close proximity (less than 6 feet) to the medicolegal death investigator during the investigation or if there is risk of exposure to infectious droplets or aerosols, then the investigator should wear a NIOSH-approved N95 particulate filtering facepiece respirator or higher level respirator for which the investigator has been fit tested. The investigator must have been medically cleared to wear the respirator and have appropriate training in the correct selection, use, and limitations of respiratory protection.

These strategies assume facilities have implemented the strategies recommended for an impending facemask shortage. Additional recommendations include:

Canceling all elective and non-urgent procedures and appointments for which a facemask is typically used by HCP
Using facemasks beyond the manufacturer-designated shelf life during patient care activities
Implementing limited re-use of facemasks
Prioritize facemasks for selected activities such as:

For provision of essential surgeries and procedures
During care activities where splashes and sprays are anticipated
During activities where prolonged face-to-face or close contact with a potentially infectious patient is unavoidable
For performing aerosol generating procedures, if respirators are no longer available

Antibody test looks for antibodies that are made by the immune system in response to a threat. Antibodies can take several days or weeks to develop after you have an infection and may stay in your blood for several weeks after recovery. As a result, antibody tests should not be used to diagnose an active coronavirus infection.
Use of antibody tests should currently be limited to population-level seroprevalance study, evaluation of recovered individuals for convalescent plasma donations. Antibody tests should not be offered to individuals as a method of determining immune status. Individuals receiving positive test results may falsely assume it is safe to discontinue physical distancing.
For additional information see the CDC’s overview of testing for SARS-CoV-2 and the FDA’s coronavirus testing basics (PDF). The AMA has also developed guidance on antibody tests. <SEP> 2. What is the purpose of antibody (or serology) tests and when do I use them? <EOS>

CDC has released guidelines for infection control in workplaces. These guidelines include the critical guidance that workers with any symptoms of illness to stay home.
In addition, businesses that remain open should ensure that customers are maintaining social distancing on their premises. They can do this by limiting the number of people allowed inside at a given time and putting colored tape on floors to help customers keep their distance from one another as well as cashiers at checkout lines. They can also encourage customers to abide by sanitary guidelines—including hand washing and sanitizing and limited touching of products—and offer disinfecting wipes and hand sanitizer stations.
Many stores now close early to give workers time to completely sanitize the store or periodically sanitize high-use items. For customers who are 60 or older, some stores have started to offer dedicated shopping hours to limit interaction with other customers. Cities can encourage stores to enact these measures to create a safer shopping environment for customers.

At home, table or pedestal fans are safe for air circulation among family members living together who are not infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. However, fans should be avoided when people who are not part of the immediate family are visiting, since some people could have the virus despite not having symptoms. Air blowing from an infected person directly at another in closed spaces may increase the transmission of the virus from one person to another. At home, offices or school, if the use of table or pedestal fan is unavoidable, it is important to increase outdoor air changes by opening windows and minimize the air blowing from one person (or group of people) to another person (or group of people).The use of ceiling fans can improve circulation of outside air and avoid pockets of stagnant air in occupied space. However, it is critical to maintain good outdoor ventilation when using ceiling fans.  An efficient way to increase outdoor air exchange is by opening windows. <SEP> Can fans be used safely in indoor spaces? <EOS>
Individual people, communities, schools, businesses, and healthcare organizations have a role to play in community mitigation. Policies*, which include limits on large gatherings, restrictions on businesses, and school closures are often needed to fully put in place community mitigation strategies.
Each community is unique. Because some actions can be very disruptive to daily life, mitigation activities will be different depending on how much disease has spread within the community, what the community population is like, and the ability to take these actions at the local level. To identify appropriate activities, all parts of a community that might be affected need to be considered, including populations most vulnerable to severe illness, and those who might be more affected socially or economically. When selecting mitigation activities, states and communities need to consider the spread of disease locally, characteristics of the people who live in the community (for example, age groups, languages spoken, overall health status), and the kind of public health resources and healthcare systems (like hospitals) that are available in the community. State and local officials may need to adjust community mitigation activities and immediately take steps to scale them up or down depending on the changing local situation.
Putting mitigation into practice is based on

Emphasizing individual responsibility for taking recommended personal-level actions
Empowering businesses, schools, and community organizations to take recommended actions, particularly in ways that protect persons at increased risk of severe illness
Focusing on settings that provide critical infrastructure or services to individuals at increased risk of severe illness
Minimizing disruptions to daily life to the extent possible

*CDC cannot address the policies of any business or organization. CDC shares recommendations based on the best available science to help people make decisions that improve their health and safety.

Governor Northam released the ban on elective procedures on May 1. Non-urgent procedures are permissible as long as facilities take appropriate preventive steps, such as screening patients and staff, ensuring adequate space for social distancing in waiting areas, appropriate PPE of staff and patients, and increased cleaning and disinfection. While walk-ins may be unavoidable at certain facilities, facilities should prioritize and facilitate the use of appointments in order to implement appropriate screening and staggering of incoming patients to allow better for social distancing and reduced numbers of people in the facility.
It is safe and important to continue providing routine preventive care including vaccinations. There are precautions your facility can take to sanitize and reduce potential exposure. Some of these precautions include: separating sick visits from well visits, screening patients at the door, providing drive-up vaccine options, and limiting the number of individuals who can accompany patients to visits.  CDC has issued revised Guidance for Planning Vaccination Clinics Held at Satellite, Temporary, or Off-Site Locations (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/admin/mass-clinic-activities/index.html.) The purpose of the guidance is to assist with jurisdictional planning and implementation of satellite, temporary, or off-site vaccination clinics by public and private vaccination organizations. The guidance is broken down into four categories:

Planning activities (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/admin/mass-clinic-activities/planning-activities.html)
Pre-clinic activities (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/admin/mass-clinic-activities/pre-clinic-activities.html)
During the clinic activities (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/admin/mass-clinic-activities/during-clinic-activities.html)
Post-clinic activities (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/admin/mass-clinic-activities/post-clinic-activities.html)

The guidance also provides information on additional considerations that are required during the COVID-19 pandemic, including physical distancing, personal protective equipment (PPE), and enhanced sanitation efforts.
When possible, VDH recommends you explore alternatives to face-to-face triage and visits. The following options can reduce unnecessary healthcare visits and prevent transmission of respiratory viruses in your facility:

Instruct patients to use available advice lines, patient portals, on-line self-assessment tools, or call and speak to an office/clinic staff, especially if they become ill with symptoms such as fever, chills, cough, sore throat, headache, muscle pain, shortness of breath, or new loss of taste or smell. Identify staff to conduct telephonic and telehealth interactions with patients. Develop protocols so that staff can triage and assess patients quickly.
Determine algorithms to identify which patients can be managed by telephone and advised to stay home, and which patients will need to be sent for emergency care or come to your facility.
Instruct patients that if they have respiratory symptoms they should call before they leave home, so staff can be prepared to care for them when they arrive.
Provide updates about changes to your policies regarding appointments, providing non-urgent patient care by telephone, and visitors. Consider using your facility’s website or social media pages to share updates.

There have been no reports of the spread of COVID via air conditioning in the United States at this time. One study from a restaurant in China described the transmission of COVID-19 to nearby diners possibly associated with the air conditioning, but close proximity of patrons and poor ventilation in the restaurant also played a role.  To date, there has been no evidence of transmission through re-circulated air in buildings such as apartment complexes; it is unlikely that COVID-19 can travel long distances through vents. It is important to continue to wear masks and maintain good hand hygiene, as well as regularly disinfect public spaces, however, at this time; there is no evidence to suggest that air conditioning units will further spread the virus. <SEP> Does air conditioning increase the spread of COVID-19? <EOS>

Vitamin D can be made in the skin by exposure to sunlight or obtained through the diet from natural sources (e.g. fatty fishes such as salmon, tuna and mackerel, fish liver oils, beef liver, cheese and egg yolks), or from vitamin D-fortified foods or vitamin D-containing supplements. In situations where individuals’ vitamin D status is already marginal or where foods rich in vitamin D (including vitamin D-fortified foods) are not consumed, and exposure to sunlight is limited, a vitamin D supplement in doses of the recommended nutrient intakes (200-600 IU, depending on age) or according to national guidelines may be considered.See WHO guidance on Vitamin and mineral requirements in human nutrition. <SEP> Are vitamin D supplements needed if individuals are not exposed to sunlight due to lockdowns? <EOS>
 Information about COVID-19 is available from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the Arizona Department of Health Services.  Additionally, the general public in Arizona can call the Arizona Poison Control System at 1-844-542-8201 or the statewide COVID-19 Hotline, available 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily, in English and Spanish, by dialling 2-1-1 in Arizona. The COVID-19 hotline is administered by 2-1-1 Arizona and the Crisis Response Network, and can address questions about how to prepare for and prevent COVID-19 spread; testing information for COVID-19; at-risk populations; what to do if an individual gets sick; COVID-19 and animals; and other resources for accurate, reliable, and up-to-date information.

As you gradually expand your social circle, you are better off meeting friends and family outdoors. We know that coronavirus spreads when someone breathes in virus that an infected person emits through coughs or sneezes, or when they talk or breathe. A recent study found that in a confined, laboratory setting, droplets containing viral particles can remain afloat for eight to 14 minutes. Smaller infectious viral particles, called aerosols, can drift around in the air even longer.Outdoors, air currents are more likely to scatter and dilute the virus, making transmission less likely than in a home, office, or other confined space with limited air circulation. Even outdoors, however, it's important to maintain a physical distance of at least six feet and wear a mask, to reduce risk even further.Coronavirus also spreads when a person touches a contaminated surface and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth. If you are participating in an outdoor gathering, bring your own foods, drinks, plates, and utensils. <SEP> As I start seeing more friends and family, does it matter whether we meet indoors or outdoors? <EOS>
A recent report on a clinical trial showed that the corticosteroid drug dexamethasone decreased the risk of dying in very ill hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The report was released prior to publication of the study in a medical journal, which means the research results have not gone through the usual careful review.Many doctors, including those in the United States, have been treating very ill COVID-19 patients with corticosteroids since the pandemic began. It makes biologic sense for those patients who have developed a hyper-immune response (a cytokine storm) to the viral infection. In these cases, it is the immune system's overreaction that is damaging the lungs and other organs, and too often leading to death.Dexamethasone and other corticosteroids (prednisone, methylprednisolone) are potent anti-inflammatory drugs. They are readily available and inexpensive.A key question if dexamethasone is effective for some COVID-19 patients: when should it be started? If you start too soon you blunt the body's natural defense system, and that could allow the virus to thrive. What might make the most biological sense is to give dexamethasone when laboratory studies suggest an immune system in overdrive after the amount of virus in the body has started to decrease.But we will need more studies beyond this most current report to confirm the drug's effectiveness. <SEP> Is dexamethasone effective for treating COVID-19? <EOS>
Antibody tests for COVID-19 are available through healthcare providers and laboratories. Check with your healthcare provider to see if they offer antibody tests and whether you should get one.
A positive test result shows you might have antibodies from an infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. However, there is a chance a positive result means that you have antibodies from an infection with a virus from the same family of viruses (called coronaviruses), such as the one that causes the common cold.
Having antibodies to the virus that causes COVID-19 might provide protection from getting infected with the virus again. If it does, we do not know how much protection the antibodies might provide or how long this protection might last.
You should continue to protect yourself and others since you could get infected with the virus again.
If you test negative, you might not have ever had COVID-19. Talk with your healthcare provider about your test result and the type of test you took to understand what your result means.
Regardless of whether you test positive or negative, the results do not confirm whether or not you are able to spread the virus that causes COVID-19. Until we know more, continue to take steps to protect yourself and others.

Working with local healthcare systems and laboratories, Mayors should advocate for improvements in the supply chain to expand access to critical materials for testing. Another important role for Mayors is to close the gap between the test capacity that does exist and critical needs.
For example, one critical need for testing is to rapidly respond to outbreaks in shelters for individuals experiencing homelessness, nursing homes, and jails. Any of these settings can be the site of a major outbreak. Together with county and state officials, mayors can assure that there is a strong response capability, including access to testing, can help reduce these risks. (Dr. Josh Sharfstein, 4/21/20)
A mayor’s special responsibility can be knowing who has testing capacity and who's overloaded, then working to coordinate capacity and ensure that everyone in the community knows where they can go if they need a test and how to get there. Can you help create sites away from crowded hospitals and emergency departments, so you're not overloading an overwhelmed system? Can you track it all on your city website? Can you designate certain times or otherwise provide testing access for priority populations like health care workers? Work to remove barriers to getting timely tests.

Why should I use the PPE Access Program?
The PPE Access Program was created to take the purchasing of PPE off your "worry list." It will provide several benefits to your business relative to other options for purchasing PPE:

All PPE will be sold with at least a 10% discount relative to a vendor's main retail channel.
The range of available PPE (developed using guidance from the NJ Department of Health) will be limited but complete, thus simplifying your selection process.
The quality and authenticity of the PPE will be assured by the vendor.
User-friendly information will be provided by the State to help you determine the right types and quantities of PPE for its needs.
Assuming a successful launch of the first phase, NJEDA intends to launch a second phase of the program that will include direct funding to offset out-of-pocket PPE expenses for certain eligible small businesses.

When will the program be live? How will I know when that happens?
The program is expected to launch in early September. Please check back on this website for additional information in the coming days on how to register for program updates (such as the announcement of the program's official launch).
How will I find participating vendors' websites and select where to buy?
All "Designated Vendor" websites will be linked from the main PPE Access Program website, and customers will have the option to purchase from as many of these vendors as they wish. <SEP> Small Businesses: Information on How to Buy Discounted PPE through the PPE Access Program <EOS>

Disposable GlovesGloves may be used by food workers but must be changed frequently and hands must be washed between glove changes and when gloves are removed. Gloves must be changed after carrying out non-food related activities such as opening/closing doors by hand, and emptying bins. Food workers should be aware that wearing gloves can allow bacteria to build up on the surface of the hands, so hand washing is extremely important when gloves are removed to avoid subsequent contamination of food. Food workers should not touch their mouth, nose and eyes when wearing gloves.Disposable gloves can give a false sense of safety and should not be used in the food work environment as a substitute for hand washing. The COVID-19 virus can contaminate disposable gloves in the same way it can get onto workers hands and contact surfaces. Removal of disposable gloves can lead to contamination of hands. Wearing disposable gloves can give you a false sense of security and may result in staff not washing hands as frequently as required.Handwashing is a greater protective barrier to infection than wearing of disposable gloves. Food businesses need to ensure adequate sanitary facilities are provided and ensure food workers thoroughly and frequently wash their hands. Soap and water is adequate for hand washing. Hand sanitisers can be used as an additional measure but should not replace hand washing.Wearing of Face MasksWHO advice on the use of masks in the context of COVID-19 should be followed. Face Masks do not have to be routinely used by food workers to protect against transmission of COVID-19. However, for some food processing activities, such as working in abattoirs or handling cooked, ready-to-eat foods, wearing face masks is a usual practice.WHO recommends that face masks should be used if a person is sick with symptoms of COVID-19 (especially coughing) or looking after someone with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.However, a food worker who is sick or who has symptoms of COVID-19 should not be allowed to work in grocery stores or other food businesses and should be excluded from work until free of symptoms or deemed fit for work by a medical doctor. <SEP> Should grocery store workers wear gloves?

Earlier in this pandemic, scientists didn’t know how easily this new virus spreads between people without symptoms, nor did they know how long infectious particles could linger in the air. There was also a shortage of N95 respirators and face masks among health care workers who were quickly overwhelmed with Covid-19 patients.
But since then, the CDC, the US Surgeon General and other doctors have changed their recommendations and are now urging the widespread use of face masks. 
The CDC now says the public needs to “cover your mouth and nose with a cloth face cover when around others.” 
“Everyone should wear a cloth face cover when they have to go out in public, for example to the grocery store or to pick up other necessities,” the CDC said.  
Scientists have made many recent discoveries about this new coronavirus, including:

It’s easy to spread this virus by just talking or breathing. 
This coronavirus is highly contagious. Without mitigation efforts like stay-at-home orders, each person with coronavirus infects, on average, another two to three other people. That makes it twice as contagious as the flu. 
This virus has a long incubation period – up to 14 days – giving a wide window of opportunity for people to infect others before they even know they’re infected. 
Carriers may be most contagious in the 48 hours before they get symptoms, making transmission even more blind.

In other words, it’s not just people who are sneezing and coughing who can spread coronavirus. It’s often people who look completely normal and don’t have a fever. And that could include you.
If 95% of Americans wore face masks in public, it would save more than 33,000 lives by October 1, according to projections from the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. <SEP> Why has the guidance on wearing face masks changed so much? <EOS>

Emergency Maximum Occupancy for restaurants is the lowest number produced by applying the following three tests:
Fifty percent of stated fire capacity (or, for spaces without a stated fire capacity, no more than 12 customers for every 1,000 square feet of the location’s total square footage, including the parts of the location that are not accessible to customers or guests).
Limiting the number of people in the space so that everyone can stay 6 feet apart.
People sitting at a table must not be within 6 feet of any customers sitting at another table. Moreover, each group of customers sitting at a counter should be separated from other groups by 6 feet.

Providers entering a room after a patient exits should use respiratory protection.

Airborne infection isolation room (AIIR): If the change rate is known, leave the room empty for enough air changes per hour (ACH) to occur, to clear the room of infectious particles.
Regular exam room: In settings where an AIIR is unavailable, providers can examine patients in a closed room while wearing appropriate PPE. It is unknown how long SARS-CoV-2 remains infectious in the air. In the interim, it is reasonable to wait two hours, which is commonly used for pathogens spread by the airborne route (e.g., measles, tuberculosis). The room should undergo appropriate cleaning and surface disinfection before it is returned to routine use. <SEP> After a person with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 exits an exam room, what is the recommended cleaning and down-time before the room can be returned to routine use? <EOS>

If you are infected, the use of surgical face masks may reduce the risk of you infecting other people. On the other hand there is no evidence that face masks will effectively prevent you from becoming infected with the virus.

If a parent is worried about what's happening, the children can pick up on that. I advise people not to hide it. Children want adults to be authentic and genuine and honest. Adults should let kids know about some of their concerns, and particularly how they’re coping with those concerns. If adults can talk with kids about how to cope with these events, they will be teaching them life skills that will help them when they face future adversity.
Of course, adults should be cautious about expressing some of the things they’re worried about, such as concerns about finances. An offhand comment to a 12-year-old child like, “The stock market just destroyed your college fund,” will only make the child worried. If that's what a parent is worried about, he or she has some time to figure that out. Adults should try and keep a positive outlook by stressing what they see as hopeful. This is a time to project to kids that there are positive actions being taken by scientists and others in charge. <SEP> How should adults communicate their own feelings to kids? <EOS>
There is no evidence to suggest that COVID-19 virus is a biological weapon. Scientific evidence suggests the COVID-19 virus spilled over from animals to people.

Please be aware that some transport media and SARS-CoV-2 testing platforms are not compatible. There is a risk of exposure to harmful cyanide gas, a by-product of a reaction between guanidine thiocyanate and similar chemicals used in certain transport media and bleach (sodium hypochlorite) used in certain SARS-CoV2 testing platforms or laboratory processes.
In general, Viral Transport Media (VTM) and Inactivating Transport Media (ITM) are the preferred transport media. Universal Transport Media (UTM) is a type of VTM. Additionally, all transport media should be sterile to avoid contamination of the specimen.
Please refer to FDA's guidance, Enforcement Policy for Viral Transport Media During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Public Health Emergency for FDA's policy regarding VTM during the COVID-19 public health emergency. As explained in this guidance, FDA does not intend to object to the distribution and use of commercial VTM under certain circumstances. This guidance was issued on July 20, 2020, to help address transport media availability concerns resulting from the COVID-19 public health emergency. Additional information about the policies in this guidance can be found on FDA's FAQs on Viral Transport Media During COVID-19 webpage.
Inactivating transport media (ITM), which are not included in the scope of the guidance, are intended to inactivate virus and stabilize nucleic acids in the sample. There is not a single formulation that these types of media use, and they can consist of proprietary formulations intended to enhance inactivation and stabilization performance. Users of ITM should carefully read the warnings and precautions noted in the labeling and confirm that each ITM is compatible with the test kits and procedures used in the laboratory. Many ITM contain guanidine thiocyanate or similar chemicals making them incompatible with certain in vitro diagnostic platforms, including those that use bleach (sodium hypochlorite), and with laboratory processes that use bleach. See warning below.
Please refer to the COVID-19 Transport Media Policy and FDA's Policy for Coronavirus Disease-2019 Tests for FDA's policies concerning alternative types of sterile transport media intended for use with molecular RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 assays. These policies apply to swab-based specimen collection by healthcare providers (HCP), and to anterior nares (nasal) and mid-turbinate specimen collection onsite by self-collection. The best available evidence at this time indicates that the following types of transport media will stabilize the SARS-CoV-2 RNA without meaningful degradation:
Liquid Amies - Specimens can be stored in liquid Amies media for up to 72 hours at 4°C.
Phosphate buffered saline and normal saline solution - Phosphate buffered saline (PBS), including molecular grade PBS when available, and other similar formulations including Dulbecco's PBS, can be used to collect and transport samples for molecular RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 assays. If PBS is not available, normal saline may be used. FDA believes that a sterile glass or plastic vial containing between 1mL and 3mL of PBS or normal saline is appropriate. Specimens can be stored up to 72 hours at 4°C.
There is limited data available on test performance with specimens which have been frozen in any transport media; therefore, specimen stability should be investigated if freezing is necessary.
At this time, FDA would need to review clinical data supporting dry swab transport (swabs transported in a tube with no media) to better understand its impact on test validity.
WARNING: Media containing guanidine thiocyanate or similar chemicals, including Longhorn PrimeStore MTM, Zymo DNA/RNA Shield, as well as that found in the Spectrum Solutions Saliva Collection Device, should not be used with in vitro diagnostic platforms that use bleach (sodium hypochlorite) in the testing platform or during laboratory processes. Media containing guanidine thiocyanate or similar chemicals produce a potentially hazardous chemical reaction that releases cyanide gas when exposed to bleach. Many laboratories may use bleach in their cleaning or decontamination processes in response to laboratory spills. If you cannot identify the type of transport media in the specimen collection tubes or if you do not know if the transport media contains guanidine thiocyanate or similar chemicals as an ingredient, handle tubes as if they contain guanidine thiocyanate or similar chemicals.
Labs should be aware that inaccurate or invalid results may occur when using media containing guanidine thiocyanate or similar chemicals with tests which are not designed for use with such chemicals. If you have questions about compatibility with guanidine thiocyanate media and your EUA test or test platform, please contact the manufacturer for further recommendations.
WARNING: Do not use Longhorn PrimeStore MTM, Zymo DNA/RNA Shield, or Spectrum Solutions Saliva Collection Device or other media containing guanidine thiocyanate or similar chemicals with the Hologic Panther or Panther Fusion Systems due to a disinfecting step involving bleach that is specific to the platform. When the bleach interacts with the guanidine thiocyanate in the transport media, it produces dangerous cyanide gas. <SEP>  What alternative transport media can I use to transport patient specimens for COVID-19 diagnostic testing?

Herd immunity is the indirect protection from an infectious disease that happens when a population is immune either through vaccination or immunity developed through previous infection. This means that even people who haven’t been infected, or in whom an infection hasn’t triggered an immune response, they are protected because people around them who are immune can act as buffers between them and an infected person. The threshold for establishing herd immunity for COVID-19 is not yet clear. <SEP> What is herd immunity? <EOS>
The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and other health groups say that getting
               kids back in school is best for their physical, mental, social, and emotional health.

Health experts, school officials, and teachers are all working hard to decide whether
               to reopen school buildings for in-person learning. To help prevent the spread of coronavirus,
               schools may limit class sizes, stagger schedules, or offer online
               (remote) learning. Some schools may offer a hybrid
               of online and in-person learning. Those schools that have in-person learning may
               require kids and teachers to wear masks, maintain social
               distancing, and take other precautions.

You cannot be removed from your home during this emergency, even if a final judgment of foreclosure has been entered and a sheriff's sale of your property has taken place.
On March 19, 2020, Governor Murphy issued Executive Order No. 106, which states that any lessee, tenant, homeowner, or any other person shall not be removed from a residential property as the result of an eviction or foreclosure proceeding.
The eviction moratorium will last until two months after Governor Murphy declares an end to the COVID-19 health crisis, unless the Governor issues another Executive Order to end it sooner.
If you are facing eviction or potential foreclosure, contact a housing counselor immediately by visiting https://njhousing.gov/foreclosure or calling 1-800-NJ-HOUSE.
Mortgage Relief
On March 28, 2020, Governor Murphy announced that financial institutions will provide mortgage forbearance and financial protections for New Jerseyans facing economic hardship as a result of COVID-19.
The initiative has secured support from Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, U.S. Bank, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and PNC Bank, in addition to over 150 other federal and state-chartered banks, credit unions, and servicers.
Under the proposal, New Jerseyans who are struggling financially as a result of COVID-19 may be eligible for the following relief upon contacting their financial institution:
90-Day Grace Period for Mortgage Payments: Financial institutions will offer, consistent with applicable guidelines, mortgage payment forbearances of up to 90 days to borrowers economically impacted by COVID-19. In addition, those institutions will:

Provide borrowers a streamlined process to request a forbearance for COVID-19-related reasons, supported with available documentation;
Confirm approval of and terms of forbearance program; and
Provide borrowers the opportunity to request additional relief, as practicable, upon continued showing of hardship due to COVID-19.

The Department of Banking and Insurance has requested that banks add forbearance payments to the end of the life of the loan, rather than requiring a consumer to make a lump sum payment after the 90-day grace period ends. However, specific terms of forbearance plans are set by the investor of your loan.
As of this writing, forbearance programs for loans backed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Housing Administration do not allow for adding forbearance payments to the end of the loan term. Governor Murphy has been advocating for this change with the federal government.
Consumers should contact the institution that services their home loan to understand the specific programs and terms available to them. Following the forbearance period, some institutions may offer borrowers the option of amortizing the payments over a period time or over the entire term of the loan.
No Negative Credit Impacts Resulting from Relief: Financial institutions will not report derogatory tradelines (e.g., late payments) to credit reporting agencies, consistent with applicable guidelines, for borrowers taking advantage of COVID-19-related relief.
Relief from Fees and Charges: For at least 90 days, financial institutions will waive or refund at least the following for customers who have requested assistance:

Mortgage-related late fees; and
Other fees, including early CD withdrawals (subject to applicable federal regulations).

Homeowners should contact lenders directly to take advantage of this relief. These lenders are experiencing high volumes of inquiries and may recommend using online services when available. Loans held by a financial institution may be serviced by another company.
Note: Most forbearance programs require the institution that services your loan to pay property taxes and insurance during the grace period, even if you do not make a payment. However, consumers will be responsible for making up these property taxes and insurance payments. Consumers should contact the institution that services their loan to determine whether the institution will make the payments initially, or if there are other requirements for making these payments.
If your bank or mortgage service is not cooperative, you can file a complaint online with the Department of Banking and Insurance or by calling (609) 292-7272 or 1-800-446-7467.
To further aid homeowners facing hardship, the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency offers homeowners free counseling through its Foreclosure Mediation Assistance Program (FMAP). Counseling is free, available now, and can be provided remotely. Counselors will provide assistance to help homeowners avoid potential foreclosure.

With the major disruptions to the normal functioning of national health systems caused by the need to respond to people who have or are affected by the virus, evidence-based, high-quality self-care interventions can provide an important alternative to the usual health facility- or health worker-based services. Self-care is a valuable part of a well-functioning health system and can be particularly useful when physical distancing measures make it more difficult for people to access their normal health care services and medications.

Yes. Michigan law generally provides that unemployment benefits may have income taxes deducted, and they are also subject to offset for child support payments and to pay debts owed for past benefit overpayments. See MCL 421.27b; MCL 421.27(m); MCL 421.62(a). The recent Executive Orders concerning COVID-19 do not suspend these provisions. <SEP> Are my unemployment benefits subject to taxes or offset for other purposes? <EOS>
The existence of an S strain and an L strain remains controversial in the scientific community, at least in terms of these being distinct contagions. Viruses evolve continually, so there are likely to be hundreds of strains at any given time, spreading in the population. However, the vast majority of these variants create no meaningful differences in the way the virus transmits, causes symptoms, or how patients are treated in the clinic.
Data from the Fred Hutchinson Center in Washington are tracking the evolution of the virus (https://nextstrain.org/ncov) and show hundreds of different mutations across the world as the pandemic spreads. You can think of these differences as similar to the differences between individual humans - the basic plan hasn't been changed, but there are lots of small differences between individual virus populations.
The important part here is that it doesn't appear there is any evidence that immunity to one form of the virus would not also lead to immunity to all the others currently known. It is more accurate to think of the COVID-19 virus as a single strain, as the differences between evolutionary changes are more meaningful for epidemiological tracking and study of transmission than anything medically meaningful at this time.

Self-quarantine is staying in place, either at home or elsewhere, for fourteen days because you have been exposed to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Self-isolation would be isolating within the house after you start showing symptoms of COVID-19. Social distancing is a response in which people remain home and distant from others (such as by refraining from shaking hands or hugging or going to the store at off hours), without any known exposure to the virus, to limit possible transmission to or from others. <SEP> What is the difference between self-quarantine, self-isolation, and social distancing? <EOS>

In times of increased demand and decreased supply, consideration can be made to use N95 respirators past their intended shelf life. However, the potential exists that the respirator will not perform to the requirements for which it was certified. Over time, components such as the strap and nose bridge may degrade, which can affect the quality of the fit and seal. Prior to use of N95 respirators, the HCP should inspect the respirator and perform a seal check. Additionally, expired respirators may potentially no longer meet the certification requirements set by NIOSH.

CDC is not aware of data regarding practices to prevent transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19 or other respiratory viruses, when multiple people share one asthma inhaler.
Students should be permitted to use their personal inhaler, as needed, to the extent permitted by state law and school policies. When students need to use of the school’s stock inhaler, the inhaler should be used and cleaned according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The American Lung Association’s Model Policy for School Districts: Stock Bronchodilatorspdf iconexternal icon recommends using inhalers with disposable spacers/mouthpieces.
Additional strategies to further minimize cross-contamination include using spacers with one-way valves and not allowing the student to touch the inhaler (e.g., the student can touch the spacer, but only the school staff administering the inhaler can touch the inhaler). Limited data from healthcare settingspdf iconexternal icon suggest wiping all surfaces of an inhaler with an alcohol-based wipe containing at least 70% alcohol after inhaler use, and then allowing these surfaces to air-dry can prevent bacterial cross-contamination. CDC is not aware of data on whether this has helped prevent viral infections or infections in the school setting.
CDC is not aware of data regarding viral contamination of spacer devices. A study evaluating the persistence of SARS-CoV-2external icon (the virus that causes COVID-19) on plastic, stainless steel, and cardboard surfaces showed that the virus is able to remain viable for up to 72 hours. The American Lung Association’s Model Policy for School Districts: Stock Bronchodilatorspdf iconexternal icon recommends using inhalers with disposable spacers or disposable mouthpieces.
School staff who administer asthma medication to students should use good hand hygiene, including washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds before and after administration. If soap and water are not available and hands are not visibly dirty, staff should use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
People with moderate to severe asthma may be at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19. CDC has more information on COVID-19 for schools and healthcare providers (including school nurses).
CDC has additional information about asthma (non-COVID related) for health professionals and schools here: https://www.cdc.gov/asthma/info.html <SEP> If each child has his or her own spacer, can a school’s metered dose inhaler be used by more than one student if the actuator is cleaned before use by another student? <EOS>

We don’t know when the pandemic will end, but we know it depends on every individual’s contribution in helping stop the transmission. The sacrifices you have made by not seeing your friends and by stopping going to school and other activities are your contributions to fighting the pandemic. By putting societies and economies on hold, we have reduced the ability of the virus to spread through our communities. These defensive measures have helped to limit some of the short-term impacts of the virus, and bought us time to translate what we have learned about the virus into solutions so that we can get back to a more familiar way of living. It is important that you continue to practise these measures and encourage your friends to do the same.

Keep in mind that "coronavirus" is actually a broad term that describes a whole family of viruses, many of which cause the common cold. The current global outbreak is caused by a specific "novel" coronavirus that causes the disease COVID-19.  
The vast majority of coronavirus diagnoses will be the equivalent of being told that you have a common cold or flu, so a positive coronavirus test result is not a cause for alarm. This can be very confusing, so please talk to your doctor or care team if you see this word used.

If COVID-19 is known to be spreading in the local community close to your facility, but there are no confirmed cases among people who are incarcerated, staff, or visitors who have been inside the facility within the past 14 days:

Implement operational actions:

Restrict non-essential transfers of people between facilities and systems.
Use alternative strategies to limit in-person court appearances where possible.
Consider suspending co-pays for incarcerated persons seeking medical evaluation for COVID-19 symptoms.
Require staff to stay home if they are sick.
Consider suspending visitation or offering non-contact visits only.
Do not allow non-essential vendors, volunteers, or tours into the facility.
Consider suspending work release programs.

Use CDC recommendations for cleaning and disinfection during the COVID-19 response to routinely clean and disinfect surfaces and objects that are frequently touched, especially in common areas.
Use household cleaners and EPA-registered disinfectants effective against the virus that causes COVID-19external iconexternal icon


Focus on good hygiene:

Remind staff, visitors, and people who are incarcerated to use everyday preventive actions (such as washing hands, avoiding touching their eyes, nose, and mouth, covering their cough).






Provide free access to soap (preferably liquid soap) and access to running water, hand dryers, tissues, and no-touch trash cans, when possible.




Continually restock hygiene supplies throughout the facility.
Consider increasing the number of staff and/or other people who are trained to clean common areas to ensure they are cleaned on a continual basis.


Conduct screenings for symptoms and fever on all new entrants, staff, and visitors prior to entering the facility and follow guidance.


Use options to increase social distancing (increasing the physical space between people in the facility, ideally at least 6 feet between people, regardless of whether or not they have symptoms):

Increase space between people who are incarcerated in holding cells and when in line.
Stagger mealtimes and time in recreation spaces.
Limit interactions in large group settings and group programs.
When possible, place beds at least 6 feet apart and have people sleep head-to-foot.
Find a separate space to check people for COVID-19 that is close to each housing unit instead of having people who are sick walk through the facility to be medically evaluated.
Remind staff to keep 6 feet apart from an individual with respiratory symptoms when possible.

Disinfect objects you pass back and forth, and then wash your hands. Practice good hygiene.
Use a separate room and bathroom for sick household members (if possible).
Provide your sick household member with a cloth face covering to wear at home to help prevent spreading COVID-19 to others. Wash it as you would normally wash laundry.
It the sick person can’t wear a cloth face covering, you should wear one while in the same room with them.
Avoid sharing personal items such as utensils, food, and drinks.
You can wash their laundry with yours. Here are some tips for how to handle their laundry:

Cloth face coverings can prevent the wearer from spreading COVID-19 to others, but they may not always be appropriate. Employees should consider using an alternative under certain conditions at work, including:

If they have trouble breathing.
If they are unable to remove it without help.
If it interferes with vision, glasses, or eye protection.
If straps, strings, or other parts of the covering could get caught in equipment.
If other work hazards associated with wearing the covering are identified and cannot be addressed without removal of the face covering.

Cloth face coverings should not be worn if their use creates a new risk (e.g., interferes with driving or vision, contributes to heat-related illness) that exceeds their benefit of slowing the spread of the virus.
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)pdf iconexternal icon suggests that an employee wear a face shield if a cloth face covering is recommended but the employee cannot tolerate wearing a cloth face covering. If used, a face shield should cover the entire front and sides of the face and extend below the chin. <SEP> When is a cloth face covering not appropriate while at work, and what can employees wear instead? <EOS>
 Pursuant to Executive Order (EO) 202.24, licensed pharmacists can  order COVID-19 tests, approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), to  detect SARS-CoV-2 or its antibodies, and administer CLIA-waived COVID-19 tests,  in patients suspected of a COVID-19 infection, or suspected of having recovered  from COVID-19 infection, subject to completion of appropriate training  developed by the Department of Health.   Pursuant to this EO, a licensed pharmacists may also be designated as a  qualified healthcare professional for the purpose of directing a limited  service laboratory (LSL), pursuant to subdivision 579(3) of the Public Health  Law, to test patients suspected of a COVID-19 infection or its antibodies  provided that such test is FDA-approved and waived for use in a limited service  laboratory.  New York State Department of Health (DOH) regulates clinical laboratories and clinical  laboratory testing under Article V, Title V of the Public Health Law. As a  result, the Education Department works closely with DOH on matters impacting  clinical laboratory testing.

More guidance on appropriate training for pharmacists pursuant to  EO 202.24 is expected to be released soon by the Department of Health.  
As of this writing, there are three CLIA-waived COVID-19 tests,  which can be performed by entities holding an LSL registration: Abbott ID NOW  COVID-19; Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2; and the Mesa Biotech Accula  SARS-CoV-2.  There are NO serology tests currently approved under the FDA  to be performed in an LSL.
Entities that wish to conduct high and moderately complex testing  must obtain a clinical laboratory permit from DOH. This is a complex process  that most pharmacies are not positioned to undertake in the short term.

The clinical spectrum of illness for the SARS-CoV-2 virus remains largely undefined in animals. Companion animals may present with respiratory or gastrointestinal clinical signs based on the presentation of other coronaviruses more commonly found in animals as well as other emerging coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-1 infection.
Clinical signs more likely to be compatible with SARS-CoV-2 infection in mammalian animals may include a combination of the following: fever, coughing, difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, lethargy, sneezing, nasal discharge, ocular discharge, vomiting, and/or diarrhea. The first description of animal illness associated with natural SARS-CoV-2 was recently published in a MMWR Report: First Reported Cases of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Companion Animals — New York, March–April 2020. 
These clinical signs may mirror many other more common animal diseases. Given the rarity of SARS-CoV-2 infections in animals, veterinarians are encouraged to perform a thorough medical evaluation of sick animals, including diagnostic testing for more common causes of illness suitable for the animal’s species and clinical presentation. <SEP> What are the clinical signs associated with SARS-CoV-2 in animals? <EOS>

A serologic test is a blood test that looks for antibodies created by your immune system. There are many reasons you might make antibodies, the most important of which is to help fight infections. The serologic test for COVID-19 specifically looks for antibodies against the COVID-19 virus.Your body takes at least five to 10 days after you have acquired the infection to develop antibodies to this virus. For this reason, serologic tests are not sensitive enough to accurately diagnose an active COVID-19 infection, even in people with symptoms.However, serologic tests can help identify anyone who has recovered from coronavirus. This may include people who were not initially identified as having COVID-19 because they had no symptoms, had mild symptoms, chose not to get tested, had a false-negative test, or could not get tested for any reason. Serologic tests will provide a more accurate picture of how many people have been infected with, and recovered from, coronavirus, as well as the true fatality rate.Serologic tests may also provide information about whether people become immune to coronavirus once they've recovered and, if so, how long that immunity lasts. In time, these tests may be used to determine who can safely go back out into the community.Scientists can also study coronavirus antibodies to learn which parts of the coronavirus the immune system responds to, in turn giving them clues about which part of the virus to target in vaccines they are developing.Serological tests are starting to become available and are being developed by many private companies worldwide. However, the accuracy of these tests needs to be validated before widespread use in the US. <SEP> What is serologic (antibody) testing for COVID-19? What can it be used for? <EOS>

COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly through close contact from person-to-person. Some people without symptoms may be able to spread the virus. 
COVID-19 may also be spread by a person touching a surface or object that has the virus on it, then touching their own mouth, nose, or eyes. This is not thought to be the main way this virus is spreading.
The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads very easily between people in the following ways:

Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).

Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people nearby or be inhaled into the lungs.

COVID-19 may be spread by people who are not showing symptoms.

Health experts are still learning more about the spread and severity of illness COVID-19 causes. <SEP> 2. How does COVID-19 spread? <EOS>
In areas where there is widespread transmission, all adults under the age of 60 and who are in general good health should wear fabric masks when they cannot guarantee at least a 1-metre distance from others. This is particularly important for adults working with children who may have close contact with children and one another. Adults aged 60 or over, or who have any underlying health conditions such as heart disease, diabetes or lung cancer, should wear a medical mask because of their higher risk of getting seriously ill from COVID-19.

The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).
COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (“community spread”) in many affected geographic areas. Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected. <SEP> How does the virus spread? <EOS>
Anyone who is experiencing even mild COVID-like symptoms should isolate themselves away from others and call their healthcare provider. Getting tested as soon as possible is important to help stop the spread of COVID-19. Anyone with these symptoms should call their provider to be evaluated for a test:

Cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fever or chills, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting, or diarrhea. 

It is important to isolate yourself as soon as you develop symptoms, even before you are tested, because if you have COVID-19, you are already contagious.
If you have been in close contact for more than 15 minutes with someone who has COVID-19, it's important to get tested right away, even if you don't have symptoms. Take action quickly and follow the instructions on this "What to do" factsheet. <SEP> 11. Who should get tested for COVID-19? <EOS>

Ensure the plan includes strategies to reduce the spread of a wide variety of infectious diseases (e.g., seasonal influenza). This includes strategies for social distancing and school dismissal that may be used to stop or slow the spread of infectious disease. The plan should also include strategies for continuing education, meal programs, and other related services in the event of school dismissal.

For example, emphasize actions such as staying home when sick; appropriately covering coughs and sneezes; cleaning frequently touched surfaces; and washing hands often. <SEP> What should I include in my emergency operations plan? <EOS>
The November 3rd General Election will primarily be held through vote-by-mail. All active registered New Jersey voters will automatically receive a prepaid return-postage vote-by-mail ballot from their County Clerks. All ballots will be mailed by Monday, October 5th.
Voters can choose to:

mail in their ballot
return their ballot through a secure dropbox
hand their ballot directly to a poll worker at a polling place on Election Day
vote in-person

All ballots being returned through the US Postal Service must carry a postmark by November 3rd, and be received by the County Clerk no later than 8 p.m. Tuesday, November 10th. Ballots which lack postmarks due to postal error received by 8 p.m. Thursday, November 5th will also be considered valid.
County boards of election will establish ballot drop boxes in each county at least 45 days before election.
Any voter who chooses to cast their vote in-person will do so on a provisional ballot. Individuals with disabilities will have access to an ADA-conforming voting machine. Each municipality will be required to open at least one in-person polling site, and all counties must ensure that at least 50 percent of their total polling places are open.
On Election Day itself, all public schools will close to in-person instruction to facilitate use of the building as an in-person polling place.
A new online voter registration system will be up and running effective September 4th, giving new voters an added ability to ensure they get registered.
For more information, visit the New Jersey Division of Elections.
Election Dates
All upcoming scheduled elections – including special elections which result from a vacancy – have been postponed to the November 3rd General Election.
Municipal and County Reorganizational Meetings
The statutory requirement that municipal and county political parties hold their reorganizational meetings either July 13 or July 14 has been suspended to allow newly elected and re-elected municipal party committee members and county party committee members to be properly seated.
Instead, municipal party committee meetings are now required to be held on July 27th, the first Monday after the election results are certified, and county party committee meetings to be held on July 28th, the first Tuesday after the election results are certified.
This requirement only applies to municipal party committees and county party committees that held elections during the July primary. Those that did not have an election can conduct their annual meetings as originally scheduled.
Petitions For Initiatives And Referendums
Governor Murphy announced an executive order allowing petitions seeking to place municipal or county initiatives or referendums on the ballot to be signed electronically and for county and municipal clerks to accept these petitions electronically.
No one should be going door-to-door, either campaigning or collecting signatures, and we should ensure that initiative and referendum campaigns can proceed in a way consistent with public health. For more information, visit the New Jersey Division of Elections.

In health facilities, use of desk or pedestal fans for air circulation should be avoided if possible unless it is in a single occupancy room when there are no visitors or staff present. If the use of desk or pedestal fans is unavoidable, ensure that the fan is directed away from the corridor or any area where people may pass by since the unfiltered air could potentially expose a passerby to the COVID-19 virus. In addition, outdoor air exchange should be increased by opening windows when fans are used.The use of ceiling fans can improve circulation of outside air and avoid pockets of stagnant air in occupied space. However, it is critical to maintain good outdoor ventilation when using ceiling fans.  An efficient way to increase outdoor air exchange is by opening windows.

To prevent infection, there are a five things that you can do. 1. Wash your hands frequently and thoroughly with soap and water and dry them thoroughly. You can also use alcohol-based hand rub if your hands are not visibly dirty and if this product is available. Cleaning your hands frequently will remove the virus if it is on your hands. You can learn how to wash your hands hands in this video (or this visual). If an alcohol-based hand rub or soap is not available, then using chlorinated water (0.05%) for handwashing is an option, but it is not ideal because frequent use may irritate your skin.  2. Cover your mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or tissue when coughing and sneezing. And remember to throw away the used tissue immediately in a bin with a lid and to wash your hands. This way you protect others from any virus released through coughs and sneezes. 3. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Hands touch many surfaces which can be contaminated with the virus. If you touch your eyes, nose or mouth with unclean hands, you can transfer the virus from the surface to yourself. 4. Keep physical distance from others. If your national or local authorities have put in place confinement measures, it is important to respect them. Taking exercise outside is good for your physical and mental health, but should only be undertaken if regulations for your area allow it. When you do go out, avoid crowded spaces and maintain at least 1 metre distance (3 feet or arms-length) from others. Avoid unnecessary visits to your house. If visits are necessary (e.g. caregiver to support with activities of daily living), ask your visitor to regularly check for symptoms to ensure that they are symptom free when visiting you. Ask them to also follow these five key actions, including washing their hands when they first enter your home.  5. Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces every day. This includes tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, taps, and sinks. If surfaces are dirty, use detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection. Learn more by clicking here. <SEP> What can I do to prevent infection? <EOS>

Probably for several months. But you might have to do it “over and over again,” since the outbreak could come in waves.
Research by the Imperial College in Great Britain “would suggest you have to institute these kinds of measures for five months, very vigorously,” said Dr. Celine Gounder, an infectious disease specialist at Bellevue Hospital Center. 
“And then you may be able to relax for a period. And then you would re-institute as the cases go up again. But we’re basically looking at doing this over and over and over again, even after a five-month period of strict social distancing, in order to curb cases until we have a vaccine.” <SEP> How long will we have to keep social distancing? <EOS>
In the event of a school dismissal, extracurricular group activities and large events, such as performances, field trips, and sporting events should also be cancelled.

The stimulus plan includes a significant expansion of unemployment benefits that would extend jobless insurance by 13 weeks. The program is aimed to help freelancers, part-time workers, furloughed employees and gig workers, such as Uber drivers, as well as full-time employees who have lost their jobs.
States have set their own rules for eligibility and benefits, which are generally calculated as a percentage of your income over the past year, up to a certain maximum. Some states are more generous than others, but unemployment typically replaces about 45 percent of your lost income. Eligible workers had been getting an extra $600 per week on top of their state benefit, but that expired at the end of July

Some people infected with the virus have no symptoms. When the virus does cause symptoms, common ones include fever, body ache, dry cough, fatigue, chills, headache, sore throat, loss of appetite, and loss of smell. In some people, COVID-19 causes more severe symptoms like high fever, severe cough, and shortness of breath, which often indicates pneumonia.People with COVID-19 are also experiencing neurological symptoms, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, or both. These may occur with or without respiratory symptoms.For example, COVID-19 affects brain function in some people. Specific neurological symptoms seen in people with COVID-19 include loss of smell, inability to taste, muscle weakness, tingling or numbness in the hands and feet, dizziness, confusion, delirium, seizures, and stroke.In addition, some people have gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, such as loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain or discomfort associated with COVID-19. These symptoms might start before other symptoms such as fever, body ache, and cough. The virus that causes COVID-19 has also been detected in stool, which reinforces the importance of hand washing after every visit to the bathroom and regularly disinfecting bathroom fixtures. <SEP> What are the symptoms of COVID-19? <EOS>
The time from exposure to symptom onset (known as the incubation period) is thought to be three to 14 days, though symptoms typically appear within four or five days after exposure.We know that a person with COVID-19 may be contagious 48 to 72 hours before starting to experience symptoms. Emerging research suggests that people may actually be most likely to spread the virus to others during the 48 hours before they start to experience symptoms.If true, this strengthens the case for face masks, physical distancing, and contact tracing, all of which can help reduce the risk that someone who is infected but not yet experiencing symptoms may unknowingly infect others. <SEP> How soon after I'm infected with the new coronavirus will I start to be contagious? <EOS>
Few kids have been found to have the illness. So it's hard for experts to yet know
               how COVID-19 might affect kids with ongoing health problems. But asthma and COVID-19
               both affect the lungs, and the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is new.
So far, kids with asthma aren't getting COVID-19 more often than people who don't
               have asthma. And kids with mild asthma don't seem to get sicker from COVID-19 than
               people without asthma. Experts are still learning if people with moderate to
               severe asthma might be more likely to get more serious symptoms if they are infected.
To be safe and avoid infection, follow the advice from the Centers
               for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other health experts. Be sure to:

Keep 6 feet apart from people you don't live with (called physical or social
               distancing).

Technically, it can, but HVAC (heating/ventilation/air conditioning) systems are not thought to be a significant factor in the spread of coronavirus. 
Many modern air conditioning systems will either filter out or dilute the virus. Ventilation systems with highly effective filters are a key way to eliminate droplets from the air, said Harvard environmental health researcher Joseph Gardner Allen.
Filters are rated by a MERV system –  their “minimum efficiency reporting value” that specifies their ability to trap tiny particles. The MERV ratings go from 1 to 20. The higher the number, the better the filtration. 
HEPA filters have the highest MERV ratings, between 17 and 20. HEPA filters are used by hospitals to create sterile rooms for surgeries and to control infectious diseases. They’re able to remove 99.97% of dust, pollen, mold, bacteria and other airborne particles as small as 0.3 microns. 
For context, this new coronavirus is thought to be between 0.06 to 1.4 microns in size. 
But “HEPA filtration is not always going to be feasible or practical,” Allen said. “But there are other filters that can do the job. What is recommended now by the standard setting body for HVAC is a MERV 13 filter.” 
High-efficiency filters in the 13-to-16 MERV range are often used in hospitals, nursing homes, research labs and other places where filtration is important.
“If you’re an owner of a home, building or mall, you want to have someone to assess your system and install the largest MERV number filter the system can reliably handle without dropping the volume of air that runs through it,” advised Erin Bromage, an associate professor of biology at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth.
“In addition, virtually all modern air conditioning systems in commercial buildings have a process called makeup air where they bring in air from outside and condition it and bring it inside,” Bromage said. “It’s worse in regards to energy, but the more outside air we bring in, the more dilution of the virus we have and then the safer you are.” <SEP> Can central air conditioning spread Covid-19 in public places? <EOS>
Playgrounds, outdoor amusement parks, and outdoor water parks may reopen at 50 percent capacity so long as they follow required social distancing policies and other safety guidelines.
Indoor amusement parks and water parks remain closed at this time. However businesses may operate amusement games outdoors, such as on a boardwalk, so long as the game does not take place in an indoor amusement park, and the business must follow required social distancing guidelines and safety protocols. Beginning September 1, amusement parks and water parks may reopen indoor facilities. Guidance will be published below in the coming days.
Playgrounds and outdoor amusement amusement facilities must follow appropriate mitigation requirements detailed in Executive Order No. 157, and the Department of Health's Executive Directive No. 20-023 and summarized below
What To Expect In Outdoor Spaces
The following summarizes some of the protocols contained in DOH ED 20-023 and EO 157. However, this summary is not a replacement for fully complying with the terms of DOH ED 20-023 and EO 157 and businesses should read the full guidance carefully to ensure full compliance.
Establishments must institute the following policies:

Limit total capacity of any outdoor area to 50 percent – excluding employees
Close indoor spaces to the public, except when entering or exiting the establishment to access the outdoor area or to use the restroom
Develop a plan to screen guests, visitors, and employees for illness upon their entry into the venue.
Require workers and customers to wear cloth face coverings while indoors and in outdoors area where social distancing is difficult to maintain, except where doing so would inhibit that individual's health, such as in the water, or where the individual is under two years of age
If a customer refuses to wear a cloth face covering for non-medical reasons then the business must decline the individual entry into the indoor premises
Limit occupancy in restrooms that remain open to avoid over-crowding and maintain social distancing through signage and, where practicable, the utilization of attendants to monitor capacity
Limit the use of equipment rented or otherwise provided by the business to one person at a time
Sanitize high-contact surfaces and shared equipment such as mini-golf clubs, harnesses, helmets, lap bars, etc. after each use
Provide sanitization materials, such as hand sanitizer and sanitizing wipes, to customers
Require reservations, cancellations and prepayments be made via electronic or telephone reservation systems to limit physical interactions.
Establish a "guest flow" plan, including managing queues and making walkways or stairways one-way or clearly divided for bi-directional travel.

What to Expect in Indoor Spaces
The following summarizes some of the protocols contained in Executive Order No. 181. Comprehensive guidance from the Department of Health will be issued and posted below in the coming days.
This summary is not a replacement for fully complying with the terms of Executive Order No. 181 and the Department of Health's guidance. Businesses should read the full guidance carefully to ensure full compliance.
Establishments must institute the following policies:

Limit occupancy of any indoor premises to 25 percent of the stated maximum capacity, if applicable, at one time, excluding staff.
Require workers and customers to wear cloth face coverings while in the indoor portion of the premises, except where doing so would inhibit that individual's health or where the individual is under two years of age.
Businesses must provide, at their expense, such face coverings for their employees.
If a customer refuses to wear a cloth face covering for non-medical reasons and if such covering cannot be provided to the individual by the business at the point of entry, then the business must decline the individual entry into the indoor premises.
Install a physical barrier, such as a shield guard, between customers and employees wherever feasible or otherwise ensure six feet of distance between those individuals, except at the moment of payment.
Limit occupancy in restrooms and locker facilities that remain open to avoid over-crowding and maintain social distancing through signage and, where practicable, the utilization of attendants to monitor capacity.
Demarcate and post signs that denote six feet of spacing in all commonly used and other applicable areas or where people may form a line.
Require infection control practices, such as regular hand washing, coughing and sneezing etiquette, and proper tissue usage and disposal.

Guidance For Employees
Recreational businesses must impose the following requirements on employees:

Require employees with symptoms of COVID-19 be sent home
Require all employees to wear face coverings while indoors, except where doing so would inhibit the individual's health
Require workers to wear gloves when in contact with customers or goods
Provide all employees with face coverings and gloves free of charge
Provide employees break time for repeated handwashing throughout the workday
Provide sanitization materials, such as hand sanitizer and sanitizing wipes to staff

Managers are responsible at all times, both by policy and by law, to provide their staff with a healthy and safe work environment. In the context of COVID-19, managers must remain informed of orders, directions and guidance issued by the Public Health Agency of Canada, Health Canada and from their own organizations. They also have the duty to inform their staff of these orders, directions and guidance. Given this, managers are encouraged to assess whether or not telework arrangements are feasible within their organization.
Managers can obtain advice from their Departmental Occupational Health and Safety Coordinator regarding health and safety processes and procedures but, at a minimum, must familiarize themselves with their responsibilities in dealing with a staff members' right to refuse dangerous work, and/or health and safety complaint. These processes are set out in the Canada Labour Code and are explained on the Employment and Social Development Canada webpage on occupational health and safety.
It is critical managers are equipped with the tools required for them to support their employees both from a well-being perspective as well as from a performance management perspective.  It is equally important managers ensure consistent contact and communication with employees to keep them appraised on the ongoing evolution and changing landscape as business resumption occurs.

Managers can also consult the Manager's Handbook Canada Labour Code Part II, developed to assist them in interpreting and implementing the requirements of Part II of the Canada Labour Code. <SEP> As a manager/supervisor, what are my responsibilities in the context of COVID-19? <EOS>
Other leave with pay is not to be used to replace vacation leave. Each employee is expected to exercise good faith in arranging, with their manager, to fully use their 2020–21 vacation leave credits during the fiscal year, taking opportunities to use the leave over the coming months when possible. An employee’s past use of vacation leave should be taken into consideration during these discussions. The manager should discuss alternate times during the fiscal year where the employee would like to take vacation leave. The manager must refer to the relevant collective agreement, or applicable terms and conditions of employment, to determine how vacation leave can be scheduled for the employee. If unsure, the manager should discuss how to approach this with their departmental labour relations representatives. <SEP> An employee is refusing to discuss taking vacation leave.

An antibody test may tell you if you’ve been exposed to COVID-19 at some point in the past. But the test isn’t reliable for confirming an active infection, and science doesn’t show if having the infection in the past means you have immunity against the disease.
Some antibodies provide lifelong protection. Others, like tetanus, need to be boosted because the protection they provide fades. Sometimes antibodies are present but we can become re-infected anyway (for example, seasonal colds). We don’t know yet which of these categories antibodies to COVID-19 fit in. This means that the most we can say to a person with antibodies to COVID-19 is that they have been exposed. The science can’t tell us yet if that means people are protected from reinfection.
Antibody tests can be useful tools, at the population level. They can provide us more information about broad historical infection trends, either regionally or statewide, and can confirm or challenge current epidemiological data. Several antibody studies may provide relevant data for decision makers, and DOH is considering using such studies to secure more data. <SEP> Should I get an antibody test? <EOS>
Designate a time to meet with your staff to educate them on COVID-19 and what they may need to do to prepare. The following resources might be helpful:

Infection prevention and control recommendations for COVID-19




Explore alternatives to face-to-face triage and visits. Some options include:

Instruct patients to use available advice lines, patient portals, on-line self-assessment tools, or call and speak to an office/clinic staff if they become ill with symptoms such as fever, chills, cough, muscle pain, sore throat, headache, shortness of breath, or new loss of taste or smell.
Identify staff to conduct telephonic and telehealth interactions with patients. Develop protocols so that staff can triage and assess patients quickly.
Determine algorithms to identify which patients can be managed by telephone and advised to stay home, and which patients will need to be sent for emergency care or come to your facility.
Instruct patients that if they have respiratory symptoms they should call before they leave home, so staff can be prepared to care for them when they arrive.


Plan to optimize your facility’s supply of personal protective equipment in the event of shortages. Identify flexible mechanisms to procure additional supplies when needed.
Prepare your facility to safely triage and manage patients with respiratory illness, including COVID-19. Become familiar with infection prevention and control guidance for managing COVID-19 patients, including:

Visual alerts (signs, posters) should be posted at entrances and in strategic places providing instruction on hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, and cough etiquette
Ensure adequate supplies (tissues, waste receptacles, alcohol-based hand sanitizer) are available for use
Utilize facemasks at triage for patients with respiratory symptoms
Create an area for spatially separating patients with respiratory symptoms. Ideally patients would be >6 feet apart in waiting areas.
Ensure that all healthcare workers wear a face mask or cloth face covering while at work to prevent asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic droplet transmission.

Doctors have restarted performing elective surgeries and procedures in many communities. But the situation in the United States is very fluid, with a rapid increase in cases in some states. For those states with rising COVID-19 cases, it's quite possible that you already have been canceled or rescheduled by the hospital or medical center in which you are scheduled to have the procedure. If not, then during this period of social distancing, you should consider postponing any procedure that can wait.That being said, keep in mind that "elective" is a relative term. For instance, you may not have needed immediate surgery for sciatica caused by a herniated disc. But the pain may be so severe that you would not be able to endure postponing the surgery for weeks or perhaps months. In that case, you and your doctor should make a shared decision about proceeding. <SEP> Should I postpone my elective surgery? <EOS>

Another 14% of these people had more serious symptoms, like hypoxia, where your bodily tissues can’t get enough oxygen. Only 5% of the people in this study developed critical symptoms, like shock or respiratory failure.

Decisions about testing are made by state and localexternal icon health departments or healthcare providers. If you have symptoms of COVID-19 and are not tested, it is important to stay home. What to do if you are sick.
COVID-19 testing differs by location. If you have symptoms of COVID-19 and want to get tested, call your healthcare provider first. You can also visit your state or localexternal icon health department’s website to look for the latest local information on testing. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized viral tests that let you collect either a nasal swabexternal icon or a saliva sampleexternal icon at home. However, you will still need to send your sample to a laboratory for analysis.
If you test positive for COVID-19, know what protective steps to take if you are sick or caring for someone.
If you test negative for COVID-19, you probably were not infected at the time your sample was collected. However, that does not mean you will not get sick. The test result only means that you did not have COVID-19 at the time of testing. You might test negative if the sample was collected early in your infection and test positive later during your illness. You could also be exposed to COVID-19 after the test and get infected then. This means you could still spread the virus. If you develop symptoms later, you might need another test to determine if you are infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.

Non-essential travel is not recommended, and some kinds of travel may pose higher risks.
Airline travel may be riskier because of time spent in lines and terminals can make distancing difficult, and you may have to sit near others for long periods of time. Masking may be inconsistent. The virus does not spread easily on flights because of the way air is circulated and filtered, but viruses on high-touch surfaces in terminals and on airplanes can increase the risk of exposure via those surfaces.
A carefully planned driving trip to a hotel or vacation home is a less risky option because you should limit the amount of time spent interacting with people from other households. 
For any trip, consider what you will do if you become ill while away, and always check restrictions in the area to which you are traveling.

Trying to generate new ideas with existing teams can be frustrating. This isn't because there’s anything wrong with your existing teams. In fact, they're the experts in what they're doing. But the problem is that they're “experts in the past,” and what you need are people to help you become experts in the future. You need what Michael Tushman and Charles O’Reilly would call an “ambidextrous organization.” You need parts of your organization continuing to do what they've done well in the past, supporting people in the community in ways they've always done. You also need the people who are going to explore the future.
When one mayor put an engineer in her homelessness working group, she got new solutions – fast. That is a perfect example of finding somebody who's maybe not an expert in community health but has expertise from other domains. The word “cross-pollination” is apt. The trick is to organize and lead these teams so that you get enough cross-pollination but avoid what they would call “cross-contamination”—for example, if, in the first minute, the engineer hears, "That's never going to work. You shouldn't do that. That's not allowed. Don't try that."

The Defence Team’s approach to resumption of business activities across DND/CAF will be tailored to the circumstances at hand and can be adapted as required to ensure that critical force generation activities continue while protecting the health, safety, security and overall well-being of our personnel.
Planning and rehearsal for reaction to future outbreaks is ongoing and includes the possible reactivation of BCPs as required. PHM, PPE and other mitigation protocols will be strictly adhered to as will provincial, territorial, regional, municipal, and host nation restrictions unless required to do otherwise in the authorized execution of a specific duty. Broad ranging returns to the workplace will be commensurate with the relaxation of restrictions in local communities and aligned with the locally demonstrated capacity to control COVID-19 transmission in a persistent COVID-19+ environment of an unknown duration. All Defence Team personnel must report immediately if they believe that they have contracted or been exposed to COVID-19 and they must comply with public health directed testing and isolation/quarantine procedures as required/appropriate. Furthermore, the Defence Team will continue to enable and exploit opportunities for working remotely for business activities that do not need to be conducted in the workplace while leveraging technology and dispersion to avoid large gatherings where physical distancing practices cannot be implemented;
The Defence Team will consider suspending these activities again temporarily if they are no longer safe to conduct or if the associated risks to personnel health, safety, security and overall wellness cannot be mitigated to an acceptable level. The anticipated benefits of physically returning to the workplace must be carefully weighed against the potential risk of a COVID-19 outbreak.
Restrictions, the availability of PPE, the current status of COVID-19 in a given location, and many other factors will be taken into consideration when making these decisions.  The CAF must be able to operate and train where COVID-19 still exists, but we must also be able to do so while protecting ourselves, our families and others in the communities of which we reside. <SEP> What happens if there is a major second or third wave of COVID-19 related outbreaks and related illnesses in the country once these activities have resumed?

The Executive Order states that a business is in compliance with the Executive Order if: 

The businesses' workers are wearing face coverings as required by the Executive Order;
 The business has updated their COVID-19 preparedness plan to address the face covering requirements to align with the requirements of the Executive Order;
The business has posted one or more signs visible to all workers, customers, and visitors instructing them to wear face coverings as required by the Executive Order—meaning when indoors (all people) and, outdoors (workers only) in situations where social distancing cannot be maintained; and
The business makes reasonable efforts to enforce the face covering requirements with respect to customers and visitors. 

The previous four sections discuss the steps that businesses can take to ensure compliance with the Executive Order.
When assessing a situation involving potential violation of the Executive Order, a local law enforcement agency or state regulatory agency should consider the seriousness of any non-compliance. Factors relevant to the seriousness of the non-compliance include but are not limited to: the number of workers and customers not requiring face covering as required by the Executive Order; how long and how often workers and customers are not wearing face coverings; the consequences of workers and customers not wearing face coverings, including indications the business is associated with the transmission of COVID-19; and the actions taken by the business to prevent and respond to their workers' and customers' non-compliance with face covering requirements.

No. There are some interesting coincidences in the 1981 fiction novel, which says “a severe pneumonia-like illness will spread around the globe” around the year 2020. Modern editions of the book call the biological strain “Wuhan-400,” and the current coronavirus outbreak started in Wuhan, China.
But there are important differences between the book and reality. The original version of the book called the strain the “Gorki-400,” in reference to a Russian locality, before it was later changed to the “Wuhan-400.” In the book, the virus was man-made, while scientists believe the novel coronavirus started in animals and jumped to humans.

Youth sports leagues and teams should communicate with players and families about the importance of social distancing, wearing cloth face coverings, and other protective measures they can take before they attend group events, such as games, competitions, or social gatherings. Youth sports organizations should also limit any non-essential visitors, spectators, volunteers, and activities involving external groups or organizations as much as possible – especially with individuals not from the local geographic area (e.g., community, town, city, or county).
During times when players are not actively participating in practice or competition, encourage social distancing by increasing space between players on the sideline, dugout, or bench. Consider posting signs or visual cues on the ground or walls to indicate appropriate spacing distance. Additionally, coaches can encourage athletes to use downtime for individual skill-building work or cardiovascular conditioning, rather than staying clustered together.

Following testing for COVID-19, we suggest patients isolate themselves at home. We recommend patients limit contact with other household members. When this is not possible, please maintain appropriate safety measures including:

Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 15-20 seconds. If soap and water aren’t available, use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.
Practice social and physical distancing by staying 6 feet away from others.
Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.
The CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public, especially in places where it’s hard to maintain at least 6 feet of distance between yourself and another person. Cloth face masks are being recommended because we now know individuals with COVID-19 could have mild or no symptoms, while still spreading the virus to others. Wearing a cloth mask doesn’t replace the need for physical distancing.
Use standard household cleansers and wipes to effectively clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces. <SEP> What steps should I take between the day of my test and my scheduled surgery or procedure to prevent being infected with COVID-19? <EOS>
 Follow these tips to help prevent COVID-19:
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.  If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
Avoid close contact with people who are sick with respiratory symptoms.
Stay home when you are sick.
Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.

For countries that are considering the use of masks, WHO advises decision-makers to apply a risk-based approach to decide where, when and what type of masks should be used.  WHO advises decision makers to consider the following: Purpose of mask use: if the intention is preventing the wearer transmitting infection to others (source control) or to offer protection to the wearer against infection (prevention). Risk of exposure to COVID-19 to the population or individual: Population level exposure measured by the amount of COVID-19 circulation in the community: that is, if there is known or suspected community transmission occurring. Individual level exposure depending on a person’s occupation: e.g., individuals working in close contact with the public (e.g., community health worker, cashier). Vulnerability of the mask wearer/population: for example, if supplies are adequate, medical masks should be used by people with pre-existing medical conditions, such as chronic respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, cancer, immunocompromised patients or diabetes mellitus of any age, or people aged 60 and over. Setting in which the population lives: settings with high population density (e.g. refugee camps, those living in cramped conditions) and settings where individuals are unable to keep a safe distance (e.g. crowded buses or other transport). Feasibility: availability and costs of masks, access to clean water to wash non-medical masks, and ability of mask wearers to tolerate adverse effects of wearing a mask. Type of mask: medical mask versus non-medical mask. Medical masks should be prioritized for health workers, symptomatic people and their caregivers. In addition to these factors, potential advantages of the use of masks by the general population in the community setting include reducing potential exposure risk from an infected person during the ‘pre-symptomatic’ period or if an infected person is asymptomatic (that is when they may not have symptoms). There are potential risks and disadvantages that should be taken into account in any decision-making process on the use of masks: Non-medical or fabric masks could increase potential for COVID-19 to infect a person if the mask is contaminated by dirty hands and touched often, or kept on other parts of the face or head and then placed back over the mouth and nose Depending on the type of mask used, could cause difficulty in breathing They can lead to facial skin breakdown They can lead to difficulty with communicating clearly They can be uncomfortable to wear It is possible that mask use, with unclear benefits, could create a false sense of security in the wearer, leading to diminished practice of recognized beneficial preventive measures such as physical distancing and hand hygiene. <SEP> What is WHO recommending to countries that are considering the use of masks for the general public? <EOS>

The New York Times article on Paterson, New Jersey, is excellent on the bread-and-butter of Paterson’s contact-tracing program. Many people have the impression that contact tracing is a high-tech concept, but as the article shows, there's a lot of simply human interaction. (Dr. Josh Sharfstein, 5/29/20)
When someone is contacted by a contact tracer, they are mainly being asked to help other people – it provides only a little help to them (in the form of advice about what to watch for and how to make sure they don’t infect family members or others, for example).  And they are being asked to disclose information that they may feel is sensitive.  People are sometimes nervous about how the data will be used or shared. "Are you going to disclose who I am? Is somebody going to know that I gave it to them?" This is where mayors' leadership is essential. We can’t safely do reopening without cooperation – and mayors, through their messaging, can help build that.

PPE remains difficult to obtain as health care facilities and physician practices return to business as usual during the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. Having patients opt for telehealth visits offers an opportunity to conserve PPE, but non-urgent procedures and other in-person visits cannot be delayed indefinitely.

CDC does not yet have evidence on the effectiveness of different types of cloth materials.
Wearing cloth masks can help prevent people infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 from spreading the virus. Make sure your cloth mask:

fits snugly but comfortably against the side of the face,
completely covers the nose and mouth,
is secured with ties or ear loops,
includes multiple layers of fabric,
allows for breathing without restriction, and
can be laundered and machine dried without damage or change to shape.

Cloth masks should NOT be worn by children less than 2 years old or anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.

In general, only essential personnel should enter the room of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Healthcare facilities should consider assigning daily cleaning and disinfection of high-touch surfaces to nursing personnel who will already be in the room providing care to the patient. If this responsibility is assigned to EVS personnel, they should wear all recommended PPE when in the room. PPE should be removed upon leaving the room, immediately followed by performance of hand hygiene.
After discharge, terminal cleaning can be performed by EVS personnel. They should delay entry into the room until time has elapsed for enough air changes to remove potentially infectious particles. After this time has elapsed, EVS personnel can enter the room and should wear a facemask (for source control) along with a gown and gloves when performing terminal cleaning. Eye protection should be added if splashes or sprays during cleaning and disinfection activities are anticipated or otherwise required based on the selected cleaning products.

Contact tracing is a process that includes several steps:Defining contacts: a contact is a person who has been exposed to someone else infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, from 2 days before to 14 days after the person started to show symptoms. Identifying contacts: this is done through an interview with the person infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 to find out who they have been in contact with.Informing contacts: each contact should be contacted by phone or in person to determine if they meet the definition and then be monitored. Each person confirmed as a contact should be informed about the goal of contact tracing, the process (including how their personal data will be protected) and who to contact with any concerns or questions. Additional essential information should be provided on how and when to quarantine, symptoms to look for, and what to do if the person becomes unwell. Managing and monitoring contacts daily: the contact person identified should be encouraged and supported to stay in quarantine, which means to separate from others in order to limit the possibility of exposing other people to infection should they become ill. During the quarantine period, daily monitoring should be implemented to monitor their health for any sign of illness. The monitoring ends 14 days after the person was last in contact with the person infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.Data processes and analysis: The information on each contact person is gathered in a database and updated daily monitoring on the person’s health status. These processes vary from country to country. See question What should be considered for data protection? <SEP> How does contact tracing work? <EOS>

“Adolescence is a time when we want more independence, more choice,” Dr. Conn notes. “Being told ‘No, you can’t do any of the things you were doing before’ is particularly difficult for them. They feel like they don’t have control over their lives.” 
That’s why it’s important for parents to let teens choose how to mark those milestones they’re missing. “Some teens may be excited about a virtual prom, but others might say, ‘I feel weird getting all dressed up to sit in front of my computer,’” she says. “Don’t push it. Leave it up to them.” 
And if your teen wants to have a birthday or graduation party after the crisis, make sure that celebration happens. Don’t let it fall by the wayside after life gets busy again. 
Get moving 
A lack of physical activity can lead to depression—or make existing depression worse. “Teens need to get some exercise in, while still observing masking and physical distancing guidelines,” Dr. Conn says. “Even a walk around the block can be helpful.” 
Other options include online dance classes and workout videos. Gentle yoga and stretching via videos or mobile apps can also break up the day and boost their mood. 
Encourage teens to give back 
Lending a hand to others in need can empower adolescents and counter feelings of helplessness. Activities can be as simple as delivering groceries to a grandparent, sewing face masks for neighbors or calling a friend who’s had a tough week. 
“This is a good opportunity for teens to see themselves as leaders and find ways to support each other and their community,” she says.  
Ask for help 
If your teen is suffering from depression or anxiety or is withdrawing from friends, family and school, seek help. In addition to calling your teen’s primary care doctor, here are some resources for teens in crisis: 


National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 1-800-273-8255 




The Trevor Project (for LGBTQ youth): 1-866-488-7386 


California Youth Crisis Line: 1-800-843-5200 


Be kind to your teen—and yourself 
“It’s important for parents and caregivers to take care of their own mental health,” Dr. Conn says. “There are so many big, looming unknowns right now. We all need to hold ourselves with a lot of kindness! We need to have empathy and compassion not just for our youth, but for ourselves.” <SEP> Let teens decide on virtual celebrations <EOS>

Clinical discussions about testing may include alternative specimen collection sources that may be more acceptable to residents than nasopharyngeal swabs (e.g., anterior nares). Providing information about the method of testing and reason for pursuing testing may facilitate discussions with residents and their medical powers of attorney.
If a resident has symptoms consistent with COVID-19, but declines testing, they should remain on Transmission-Based Precautions until they meet the symptom-based criteria for discontinuation.
If a resident is asymptomatic and declines testing at the time of facility-wide testing, decisions on placing the resident on Transmission-Based Precautions for COVID-19 or providing usual care should be based on whether the facility has evidence suggesting SARS-CoV-2 transmission (i.e., confirmed infection in HCP or nursing-home onset infection in a resident).
Only residents who have a confirmed positive viral test should be moved to COVID-19-designated units or facilities. <SEP> How should facilities approach residents who decline testing? <EOS>

  We don’t know for sure which animals can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including dogs and cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19. Several tigers at a zoo in New York have also tested positive for the virus.
Recent research shows that ferrets, cats, and golden Syrian hamsters can be experimentally infected with the virus and can spread the infection to other animals of the same species in laboratory settings. Pigs, chickens, and ducks did not become infected or spread the infection based on results from these studies. Data from one study suggested dogs are not as likely to become infected with the virus as cats and ferrets. These findings were based on a small number of animals, and do not show whether animals can spread infection to people.
Currently, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by the virus that causes COVID-19 and the role animals may play in the spread of COVID-19. <SEP>  What animals can get COVID-19? <EOS>
There is still a lot that is unknown about COVID-19 and how it spreads. Coronaviruses are thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets. Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from domestic or international mail, products or packaging. However, it may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.

When wearing a cloth face covering, it should fit over the nose and mouth, fit snugly but comfortably against the side of the face, and be secured with ties or ear loops. The cloth face covering should allow the wearer to breathe without restriction.
Employees should avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth as well as the inside or outside of the face covering while putting on, wearing, and removing it. When putting on and removing it, they should only touch the ties or ear loops.
If storing the cloth face covering while at work, employees should place the used cloth face covering into a container or paper bag labeled with the employee’s name.
Cloth face coverings should not be shared with others unless they are washed and dried first.
If the cloth face covering becomes wet, visibly soiled, or contaminated at work, it should be removed and stored to be laundered later. The employee should put on a clean cloth face covering or disposable face mask. If cloth face coverings are provided by the employer, a clean face covering should be issued to replace the soiled one.
Employees should wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds before and after putting on, touching, or removing cloth face coverings. If soap and water are not available, they should use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.
Laundry instructions depend on the cloth used to make the face covering. In general, cloth face coverings should be washed regularly (e.g., daily after each shift) using water and a mild detergent and dried completely in a hot dryer. If a washing machine and dryer are not available, an alternative is to soak the cloth face covering in a diluted bleach (0.1%) solution, rinse, and air dry completely. Hands should be washed before laundering the cloth face coverings. <SEP> How should cloth face coverings worn at work be handled, stored, and washed? <EOS>

Q: If I test positive for COVID-19, do I have to tell the contact tracer everyone I was in close contact with?
Your help is the key to stopping the spread of COVID-19 and protecting your loved ones.
If you tested positive, you may have spread the virus to others without knowing it. Those individuals could now be infected and putting their loved ones at risk.
That's why if you test positive, we ask you to share your close contacts – anyone who was within six feet of you for more than 10 minutes starting two days before you first had symptoms – solely for the purpose of helping those people get tested or quarantine as they could be infecting others.
Your information is confidential. Your name will not be released to your contacts or your COVID-19 status – that information will only be known to public health officials and our local health department partners, if needed.
Contact tracing goes hand in hand with testing, and is critical to supporting patients with suspected or confirmed infection. For COVID-19, the ability to scale our contact tracing capacity is how we will break the chain of transmission, slow community spread, and restart the economy – but we cannot succeed without your help.
Q: If I'm exposed, will I be forced to separate from others who have not been exposed? What if I'm a single parent or living with another family?
Individuals who may have been exposed to COVID-19 are expected to follow the direction of public health officials when asked to self-quarantine.
Self-quarantine means that you will stay in your home as much as possible so that you don't infect others. Your family members will stay with you. However, there are things you can do to help ensure that your family isn't infected and contact tracers can provide more information about how to do that.
When a contact tracer calls, they will discuss any needs you may have, inquire about your living situation, and connect you with additional support if you require help. The State is securing beds at hotels, field medical stations, and other locations for individuals who cannot safely quarantine at home.
In addition, you will learn more about community support available to you such as job security, unemployment, child care resources and food assistance such as SNAP. For example, New Jersey has taken steps to protect workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Under a new law, your employer can't terminate or refuse to reinstate you if you have, or are likely to have, an infectious disease which forced you to miss time at work.
Q: Will they put any kind of sticker, sign or poster on my house so others know I may have been exposed and should be quarantined?
No.
Your information is confidential. Your name will not be released to your contacts or your COVID-19 status – that information will only be known to public health officials and local health department partners, if needed.
Q: Will NJ allow other third-parties to access the information? If so, which ones and for what purposes?
No. Third-parties will not have access to the personal information you share.
We have placed strict limits on the contact tracing program – we collect limited data (only what is needed to keep you and your close contacts safe), use it for limited purposes (stop the spread of COVID-19), and limit who it is shared with (public health officials and our local partners).
Q: How did a contact tracer get my name and phone number?
Contact tracers are calling individuals who have tested positive for COVID-19 or may have come in close contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19.
Individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 work with a contact tracer to list all of their close contacts – anyone who was within six feet of them for more than 10 minutes starting two days before they first had symptoms.
The COVID-19 positive individual then gave your number to a contact tracer, so they could reach out solely for the purposes of letting you know about the risk to you and the need to self-quarantine. This will help limit exposure to your family and others if you develop symptoms.
Q: How will I know if the person calling me is an official contact tracer and not a scam? Is there a way to verify it is not a scam?
Contact tracers will reach out via phone, text message, or letters dropped off at your door. Contact tracers will provide their name, agency, and a phone number.
When a contact tracers reaches out, it is to let you know about the risk to you and your family and what you can do to protect your loved ones and community.
A contact tracer will never ask for your social security number. A contact tracer will never ask for confidential financial information like your bank or credit card number.
A contact tracer will never ask about your immigration status and ICE will not be notified about your location.
If someone is requesting personal information covered above, it is likely a scam. You can report these calls online to the New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs or by calling 973-504-6240.
If you have any doubts about the legitimacy of your conversation with a contact tracer, you may hang up and call your local health department. You should also feel free to request the name and ID of anyone who calls.
You can find your local health department's contact information through the Department of Health's directory.
To learn more about scams and distinguish between facts and rumors/disinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic visit the New Jersey Office Homeland Security and Preparedness' Rumor Control and Disinformation page.
Q: Is my cell phone being tracked or my GPS location followed?
No. An individual's cell phone is never tracked, a GPS location is not followed, and geolocation data is not collected or used.
Contact tracing relies on individuals sharing who they may have come into close contact with and who may have been infected with COVID-19.
Q: Will I be asked about my immigration status and will ICE be notified about my location?
No.
You and the information you share will not be used for the purposes of law enforcement or immigration enforcement in any way. In addition, it will not negatively affect your public charge assessment or be used to deny access to health care or any other essential service.
Q: Can my employer fire me if I was told to quarantine and am not able to go to work?
The State of New Jersey has passed legislation that prohibits an employer – during the ongoing Public Health Emergency and State of Emergency – from terminating or refusing to reinstate an employee who has, or is likely to have, an infectious disease which requires the employee to miss time at work.
An employee who requests or takes time off from work, based on the recommendation of a public health professional, may not be terminated or refused reinstatement if the employee is likely to infect others in the workplace.
You can report a possible violation of this law through the New Jersey Department of Labor's Division of Wage and Hour Compliance in English or Spanish. <SEP> What are common misconceptions about contact tracing? <EOS>
VDH recommends that veterinarians consider prioritizing appointments for:

Dogs and cats that have never been previously vaccinated for rabies,
Older and/or immunosuppressed animals, and
Any animal that requires a rabies booster vaccine due to an exposure.

The reason for this recommendation is that, in most cases, the public health response to a healthy/immunocompetent dog or cat exposed to rabies for which there is a record of previous vaccination (even if the vaccination is several months expired) is a booster and 45 days confinement (i.e., the same as a currently vaccinated animal).
For questions concerning animal licensing requirements in your locality, you can contact your local treasurer's office and/or animal control agency, as these would be the local government entities that oversee licensing and enforce rabies vaccination laws. <SEP> How should I prioritize appointments for animals that need a rabies vaccination? <EOS>
It is important to remember that the use of masks should be combined with other key infection prevention and control measures such as hand hygiene and physical distancing, as they do not protect against COVID-19 on their own.WHO recommends the use of medical masks for the following individuals:Health workersWhy?  Health workers are the most likely to be exposed to the COVID-19 virus because they are in close contact with patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and their surrounding environment. However, there are also reports of many health workers who are infected with the COVID-19 virus outside of the health facilities.In areas where there are many people infected with COVID-19 in the community, health workers and caregivers should wear a medical mask while in clinical areas throughout the shift (apart from eating and drinking or needing to change the mask for specific reasons). This includes any clinical area, and in particular, triage and emergency rooms, family physician/GP practices, outpatient departments, COVID-19 dedicated units, haematological, cancer and transplant units, long-term health and residential facilities. It includes doctors, nurses, midwives, cleaners, and others working in clinical areas.This is in addition to the previously WHO recommended practices that health workers caring for suspect or confirmed COVID-19 patients should follow droplet/contact precautions where a medical mask is part of the PPE package of recommendations, that includes: surgical gown, gloves, medical mask, and eye protection.Please note, this is different from respirators, which are recommended for use in the context of where aerosol generating procedures are performed in health settings for a suspect/confirmed COVID-19 patient. In these settings, WHO recommends the use of airborne and contact precautions.Link to how safely put on and remove PPE for droplet/contact precautions for COVID-19.COVID-19: How to put on and remove personal protective equipment (PPE)More information can be found in the guidance document on Infection prevention and control during health care when novel coronavirus (nCoV) infection is suspected.Infection prevention and control during health care when novel coronavirus (nCoV) infection is suspectedPeople who are sick and exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 or may suspect they have COVID-19Why? Anyone who is sick, even with mild symptoms such as muscle aches, slight cough, sore throat or fatigue, should isolate at home and use a medical mask. Coughing, sneezing or talking can generate droplets that can spread the infection. These droplets can reach the face of others nearby or land on the surrounding environment. If an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks wearing a medical mask, this helps to protect those nearby from infection. Sick people needing to go to a health facility should wear a medical mask. Anyone taking care of a person at home who is sick with COVID-19Why? Those caring for individuals who are sick with COVID-19 should wear a medical mask for protection. Close and frequent contact with someone with COVID-19 can put those caring for them at high risk. People 60 years old and over or anyone with pre-existing medical conditions (such as diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, or cancer) Why? These people should wear a medical mask for protection because they are at a higher risk of becoming seriously ill with the disease and dying.Remember, the use of a fabric mask alone is not sufficient to provide an adequate level of protection. Maintain a minimum physical distance of at least 1 metre from others, frequently clean your hands and avoid touching your eyes, mouth, and nose while wearing a mask.WHO recommends that people always consult local authorities on recommended practices in their area. <SEP> Which individuals should wear medical masks in the context of COVID-19 according to WHO? <EOS>

Businesses should work with their local health departments on contact tracing and cleaning recommendations. Some facilities, such as child care settings and schools, do have to report positive cases. CDC guidance addresses what businesses need to do if someone gets sick. <SEP> Do businesses have to report to the state, other employees or customers when an employee tests positive? Do they have to close down? <EOS>
Yes, it is possible. You may test negative if the sample was collected early in your infection and test positive later during this illness. You could also be exposed to COVID-19 after the test and get infected then. Even if you test negative, you still should take steps to protect yourself and others. See Testing for Current Infection for more information. <SEP> Can someone test negative and later test positive on a viral test for COVID-19? <EOS>
Please practice caution no matter where you live. At this time, it is just not safe to jump back into the world with two feet, especially if you are in an area where cases are surging. 
And in many states, that's the situation. Many re-openings have been followed by a surge of new cases.
Now a number of states are pausing plans to re-open or even reimposing restrictions they had lifted earlier.

Parents are encouraged to consider temporary guardianship options for their children in the event they become sick or incapacitated with COVID-19.
The New Jersey Department of Children and Families recognizes these are uncomfortable, but necessary, conversations. Preparation and planning are vital elements of disaster/pandemic readiness. Taking proactive steps can help to alleviate fear and stress related to uncertainty. There are a few things families can do before experiencing a possible quarantine or hospitalization that requires separation from your children.
First, gather any documents regarding custody, health or education so that they are accessible to anyone who may need to step in to assist. Those documents include:

Custody or Guardianship Orders related to your child(ren)
Birth certificates
Important health records
Health Insurance cards/documents
School Records
Living Will
Will and/or Trust Documents
Social Security Cards
A list of important contacts (names, phone numbers, etc.)

Second, in the absence of the availability of another parent or guardian to ensure the well-being of a child during a COVID-19 related separation, residents may need to appoint a person they trust to serve in that capacity. Parents or guardians can appoint a person in advance of any circumstance that would prevent them from caring for the child themselves. One option is to use a power of attorney (POA) or "attorney in fact."
Power of Attorney forms are available here for download.
The Power of Attorney form allows families to name individuals that can step in as guardians under very specific conditions. It is a legal document that lays out guidelines for certain actions to take place when a person becomes ill or incapacitated. The POA can allow a temporary guardian to take custody of, care for, and access medical treatment for a minor child. It can be changed or withdrawn at any time.
In the event a child is without a caregiver due to a parent's illness or incapacitation, the Department of Children and Families Division of Child Protection and Permanency (DCPP) may be called to take custody. The Division works to identify appropriate and willing family, friends or neighbors that can provide short-term guardianship, but these efforts can take time and a child could be placed in foster care while details and arrangements are made.
To assist parents in taking the first steps to develop a plan, DCF has created the COVID-19 Family Prep Kit instructional, detailing the types of items that should be incorporated.

Some governments have suggested that the detection of antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, could serve as the basis for an “immunity passport” or “risk-free certificate” that would enable individuals to travel or to return to work assuming that they are protected against re-infection. At this point in the pandemic, there is not enough evidence about the effectiveness of antibody-mediated immunity to guarantee the accuracy of an “immunity passport” or “risk-free certificate.” That is, there is currently no evidence to determine whether or not people who have recovered from COVID-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection.WHO view on the use of an "Immunity passports" in the context of COVID-19 is available here: https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/immunity-passports-in-the-context-of-covid-19 <SEP> What is an immunity passport or a risk-free certificate and what is WHO’s view of this? <EOS>
If you have minor symptoms, such as a slight cough or a mild fever, there is generally no need to seek medical care. Stay at home, self-isolate and monitor your symptoms. Follow national guidance on self-isolation.   Avoiding contact with others and visits to medical facilities will allow these facilities to operate more effectively and help protect you and others from possible COVID-19 and other viruses. Seek medical care if your health gets worse, or if there is no one in your family that can take care of you at home. It is important that you follow the procedures put in place by your country. Ask a family member or another trusted adult how you can find out what these procedures are where you live.

 There are many tests being used to diagnose COVID-19 that the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency. All of these diagnostic tests identify the virus in samples from the respiratory system, such as from nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs.

Screening employees is an optional strategy that employers may use. Performing screening or health checks will not be completely effective because asymptomatic individuals or individuals with mild non-specific symptoms may not realize they are infected and may pass through screening. Screening and health checks are not a replacement for other protective measures such as social distancing.
Consider encouraging individuals planning to enter the workplace to self-screen prior to coming onsite and not to attempt to enter the workplace if any of the following are present:

Symptoms of COVID-19
Fever equal to or higher than 100.4oF*
Are under evaluation for COVID-19 (for example, waiting for the results of a viral test to confirm infection)
Have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and not yet cleared to discontinue isolation

*A lower temperature threshold (e.g., 100.0oF) may be used, especially in healthcare settings.
Content of screening questions
If you decide to actively screen employees for symptoms rather than relying on self-screening, consider which symptoms to include in your assessment. Although there are many different symptoms that may be associated with COVID-19, you may not want to treat every employee with a single non-specific symptom (e.g., a headache) as a suspect case of COVID-19 and send them home until they meet criteria for discontinuation of isolation.
Consider focusing the screening questions on “new” or “unexpected” symptoms (e.g., a chronic cough would not be a positive screen). Consider including these symptoms:

Fever or feeling feverish (chills, sweating)
New cough
Difficulty breathing
Sore throat
Muscle aches or body aches
Vomiting or diarrhea
New loss of taste or smell

Protection of screeners
There are several methods that employers can use to protect the employee conducting the screening. The most protective methods incorporate social distancing (maintaining a distance of 6 feet from others), or physical barriers to eliminate or minimize the screener’s exposures due to close contact with a person who has symptoms during screening. Examples to consider that incorporate these types of controls for temperature screening include:

Reliance on Social Distancing: Ask employees to take their own temperature either before coming to the workplace or upon arrival at the workplace. Upon their arrival, stand at least 6 feet away from the employee and:

Ask the employee to confirm that their temperature is less than 100.4o F (38.0o C) and confirm that they are not experiencing coughing or shortness of breath.
Make a visual inspection of the employee for signs of illness, which could include flushed cheeks or fatigue.
Screening staff do not need to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) if they can maintain a distance of 6 feet.


Reliance on Barrier/Partition Controls: During screening, the screener stands behind a physical barrier, such as a glass or plastic window or partition, that can protect the screener’s face and mucous membranes from respiratory droplets that may be produced when the employee sneezes, coughs, or talks. Upon arrival, the screener should wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or, if soap and water are not available, use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Then:

Make a visual inspection of the employee for signs of illness, which could include flushed cheeks or fatigue.
Conduct temperature and symptom screening using this protocol:

Put on disposable gloves.
Check the employee’s temperature, reaching around the partition or through the window. Make sure the screener’s face stays behind the barrier at all times during the screening.
If performing a temperature check on multiple individuals, make sure that you use a clean pair of gloves for each employee and that the thermometer has been thoroughly cleaned in between each check. If disposable or non-contact thermometers are used and you did not have physical contact with an individual, you do not need to change gloves before the next check. If non-contact thermometers are used, clean and disinfect them according to manufacturer’s instructions and facility policies.


Remove and discard PPE (gloves), and wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.

If social distance or barrier controls cannot be implemented during screening, PPE can be used when the screener is within 6 feet of an employee during screening. However, reliance on PPE alone is a less effective control and more difficult to implement given PPE shortages and training requirements.

Reliance on Personal Protective Equipment (PPE): Upon arrival, the screener should wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, put on a face mask, eye protection (goggles or disposable face shield that fully covers the front and sides of the face), and a single pair of disposable gloves. A gown could be considered if extensive contact with an employee is anticipated. Then:

Make a visual inspection of the employee for signs of illness, which could include flushed cheeks or fatigue, and confirm that the employee is not experiencing coughing or shortness of breath.
Take the employee’s temperature.

If performing a temperature check on multiple individuals, make sure that you use a clean pair of gloves for each employee and that the thermometer has been thoroughly cleaned in between each check. If disposable or non-contact thermometers are used and you did not have physical contact with an individual, you do not need to change gloves before the next check. If non-contact thermometers are used, you should clean and disinfect them according to manufacturer’s instructions and facility policies.

A physician’s primary duty during a public health emergency like the COVID pandemic is to protect the health of the community.  
In a quarantine situation, each individual physician’s role is to engender cooperation by communicating clearly and by acknowledging the natural fears and feelings of powerlessness that infectious disease outbreaks create. In some circumstances, however, when persuasion fails and a patient poses a risk to others but won't voluntarily adhere to isolation, physicians should support mandatory quarantine. 
The AMA Code of Medical Ethics (E-8.4) states that during a public health crisis, it is a physician’s duty to: 
Educate patients and the public about the nature of the public health threat, potential harm to others, and benefits of quarantine and isolation. 
Encourage patients to adhere voluntarily to quarantine and isolation. 
Support mandatory quarantine and isolation when a patient fails to adhere voluntarily. 
Inform patients about and comply with mandatory public health reporting requirements.

A person’s risk of getting severely ill from COVID-19 increases with age, and people of any age with underlying medical conditions are also at higher risk. In many sports, it may be possible for coaches and officials to stay at least 6 feet away from players by modifying their normal routine. Coaches and officials who cannot physically distance 6 feet from players should wear face coverings to protect other people in case you are infected. CDC currently recommends the use of face coverings for those who are not able to physically distance at least 6 feet apart.
You can also offer options for individuals at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 (such as virtual coaching and in-home drills) that limit their risk of getting infected. You could also limit youth sports participation to staff and youth who live in the local geographic area (e.g., community, city, town, or county) to reduce the risk of COVID-19 spreading from areas with higher levels of illness.

COVID-19 is associated with a range of concerns, such as fear of falling ill and dying, of being socially excluded, placed in quarantine, or losing a livelihood. Symptoms of anxiety and depression are common reactions for people in the context of COVID-19. Mental health and psychosocial support should be made available to all workers.

               your child.
Ask care providers to wear a face covering or mask while in your home and when
               caring for your child. They should wash their hands well for at least 20 seconds when
               they arrive, and often while they provide care. Set up hand-washing stations with

A waiver request will only be required if deviating from a provision or provisions of the PHS Policy. At this point, OLAW expects Assured institutions to explore and implement available flexibilities when conducting the semiannual program (and protocol) review and only request waivers for justifiable reasons (see NOT-OD-20-088). Semiannual program review and in particular, review of the institution’s disaster plan, is even more critical and necessary to ensure the health and safety of personnel and animals during the pandemic. 
 
The PHS Policy affords flexibility in that “The IACUC may, at its discretion, determine the best means of conducting an evaluation of the institution’s programs and facilities. The IACUC may invite ad hoc consultants to assist in conducting the evaluation. However, the IACUC remains responsible for the evaluation and report.” One option is for the semiannual program review to be conducted at a convened IACUC meeting or by using teleconferencing, or video conferencing, with a quorum present.
 
An example of program review using social distancing is for IACUC members to be assigned various elements of the program using the OLAW checklist and have them provide written reviews identifying changes in the program. The reviews are compiled and shared via email for the entire IACUC to consider. Members add any comments to the compiled report and the final version is signed via email with digital or scanned signatures. However, keep in mind the following:

No IACUC member should be involuntarily excluded from participating in the program review.
The majority of the IACUC must sign the resulting semiannual report to the Institutional Official. This may be handled via email with digital or scanned signatures.
IACUCs may institute alternatives to face-to-face meetings such as teleconference or video conferencing (see NOT-OD-06-052) as social distancing measures to prevent the spread of disease. <SEP> 12. Will OLAW approve waivers for the semiannual program review? <EOS>
 The AZ Dept. of Health Service Office of Newborn Screening advises that newborn screening guidelines have not changed due to COVID-19. Certain conditions are often identified on the second screen after a normal first screen, and if the second screen is not completed, these conditions can be missed or identified late, causing irreversible damage. To limit exposure of COVID-19 to newborns and families, providers are encouraged to collect the second screen during the first well check in-office instead of sending out to a lab. The Office of Newborn Screening can help providers who require supplies to collect in-office tests and provide a free FedEx account for timely transport of newborn screening samples.

Ideally, newborn visits should be done in person so that your pediatric healthcare provider can check your baby’s growth and feeding, check your baby for jaundice, make sure your baby’s newborn screening tests were done, and get any repeat or follow-up testing, if necessary. Ask your healthcare provider how they are taking steps to separate healthy patients from those who may be sick. Some health care providers may choose to delay visits like well child checks and routine vaccine visits. These decisions will be based on circumstances in your community and your child’s individual care plan. Call your provider’s office to ask about any upcoming appointments or about when your child’s vaccinations are due.
Vaccines are also an important part of keeping your child healthy, especially if your child is under 2 years old. Vaccines help provide immunity before being exposed to potentially life-threatening diseases. Although there is not yet a vaccine to help protect against COVID-19, vaccines for illnesses such as measles, influenza (flu), whooping cough (pertussis), and other infectious diseases are important for your child’s health. This will help to prevent outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases among young children during the COVID-19 pandemic. <SEP> Should I take my baby to their newborn visits at the pediatrician’s office? <EOS>
DVPNI allocations were assigned to ensure the most critical business functions could occur, despite some technology limitations. As system upgrades have been completed, DVPNI allocations have similarly increased. Since March, we’ve more than tripled the original system capacity. Now, we’re working with our partner Shared Services Canada to double that capacity again so we anticipate being well positioned to support the demand for mobile access to the DWAN going forward.
If you were not initially provided DVPNI access, please discuss with your manager whether this is now a possibility given the increased capacity on the network.
Additionally, in regard to functionality, the ability to chat (text) with MS Teams on DWAN is now available.

Public health laboratories in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. are now testing for the coronavirus and many more labs are completing testing verification procedures outlined by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA).
Currently, there is still a shortage of COVID-19 test kits in the United States. There are more resources that have become available as regulations have changed due to the need for more testing:
Center for Disease Control – the CDC’s Office of International Reagent Resource is offering tests, but they must be processed in Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified labs.
State, academic, and independent labs – these labs have been developing kits for their own testing as the FDA has loosened regulations. These labs must still validate their results according to FDA regulations and submit them for emergency use authorization within 15 days.
Commercial companies – commercial companies have been increasingly putting coronavirus kits out into the market in recent weeks as regulations have loosened. While some are still very specialized and require specific instrumentation, easier and more automated tests are being developed. Test kits that work in a half hour by simply changing the color of a piece of paper are currently in the concept stage. A list of commercial companies that are selling test kits can be found here.

On April 3, the CDC released an updated recommendation regarding the use of cloth face coverings to help slow the spread of COVID-19. CDC recommends the use of simple cloth face coverings as a voluntary public health measure in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies).
For workers on farms, and in food production, processing, and retail settings who do not typically wear masks as part of their jobs, consider the following if you choose to use a cloth face covering to slow the spread of COVID-19:
Maintain face coverings in accordance with parameters in FDA’s Model Food Code sections 4-801.11 Clean Linens and 4.802.11 Specifications.
Launder reusable face coverings before each daily use.
CDC also has additional information on the use of face coverings, including washing instructions and information on how to make homemade face covers.
NOTE: The cloth face coverings recommended by CDC are not surgical masks or N-95 respirators. Those are critical supplies that must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance. <SEP> Should employees in retail food and food production settings wear face coverings to prevent exposure to COVID-19?

AHCCCS recognizes that some providers may experience a reduction in the number of services they can provide during the emergency period as a result of members avoiding provider offices. AHCCCS is actively exploring opportunities to ensure provider sustainability to address this challenge.

One option that AHCCCS intends to implement is to make interim payments to Targeted Investment (TI) Program participants for Year 3 as soon as possible. Information has been emailed to TI participants regarding these interim payments. 
AHCCCS is also evaluating potential flexibility the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) may provide, which would allow AHCCCS and its Health Plans to make limited "retainer" payments to specific types of providers.These payments would be specifically related to reductions in utilization of services related to the COVID-19 emergency, such as missed appointments or decreased frequency of members receiving services. Such payments would be intended to help offset the reduction in revenue experienced by providers due to members staying home and avoiding care.
The Arizona Legislature has passed legislation stating that AHCCCS may authorize payments to specific types of providers to ensure that providers maintain capacity to continue to provide services during the state of emergency, however, no additional funding was appropriated for this purpose. 

Any action AHCCCS takes will require CMS approval and upon approval AHCCCS will work swiftly to operationalize the dissemination of retainer/retention dollars. <SEP>  Will AHCCCS provide financial assistance to providers to address revenue losses experienced as a result of the COVID-19 emergency? <EOS>

By their very nature, athletic facilities like gyms tend to be germy, and gym equipment can be difficult to sanitize. In a study published earlier this year, researchers found drug-resistant bacteria, flu virus and other pathogens on about 25 percent of the surfaces they tested in four different athletic training facilities.
If your gym is open and you plan to go, disinfect any surfaces that you touch. Wash your hands frequently, or use hand sanitizer. When spraying a disinfectant, give it a fews minutes to kill germs before wiping. Clean any grime or dust off surfaces first. Once you're done with that machine, disinfect it again for the next person.

The variation in mortality rates across the world reflect many factors, including the age group most affected, preexisting medical conditions, and the rate of testing. In addition, mortality rates are difficult to determine early in the outbreak because most people are still in the midst of their illness. Mortality estimates that include those people who do not have an outcome yet will undercount the mortality rate. In the absence of widespread testing or appreciation of the overall attack rate, morality rates will appear higher than they are in areas with widespread testing because those with milder illness will not receive tests and not be counted.

Businesses can already see that if we run debt repayment and bankruptcy as we do in ordinary times, a vast number of organizations around the world will be bankrupted. If we default to those rules, it would needlessly destroy the ability of many of these businesses to recover. Private equity and other investors or creditors are showing flexibility in working with private-sector borrowers in order to keep the whole ecosystem going. They are going to have to do the same thing in municipal finance. While the usual rules may apply on a good day, this is not a good day. The CARES Act is designed in part to provide a flow of funds to consumers so that businesses still have revenue. We haven't done that yet with the municipal side, but this is a challenge that’s coming, and there will have to be a policy approach that resembles the flexibility we’re seeing on the business side.

If you are eating differently, you might be able to manage the change on your own. If you are snacking a lot, that’s OK. But if it bothers you, try to assess whether you are actually hungry and, if so, try to add fruits and vegetables into your routine, if you can.
If you’re regularly not eating enough, find something you can tolerate. Schedule your mealtimes like any other essential appointment. You can also set alarms as reminders to drink some water, or to eat something.
But eating disorders can be serious, even life threatening. Roughly one in 10 Americans struggle with disordered eating, and the pandemic has created new hurdles for those managing difficult relationships with food.
“When the world feels out of control, people want to have control over something,” said Jessica Gold, a psychiatrist at Washington University in St. Louis who treats patients with eating and other mental health disorders. “Often, it’s what you put in your mouth.”

It is the law that you must wear a face covering when travelling in England on a:

bus or coach
train or tram
ferry or hovercraft or other vessel
aircraft
cable car
in an enclosed transport hub, such as a train or bus station

If you do not wear a face covering you will be breaking the law and could be fined £100, or £50 if you pay the fine within 14 days. As announced, we will bring forward changes to mean that for repeat offenders these fines would double at each offence up to a maximum value of £3,200.
Please be aware that some people are exempt, and do not have to wear a face covering on public transport, including for health, age or equality reasons.
We have published guidance for those making face coverings at home, to help illustrate the process.
A face covering is not the same as the surgical masks or respirators used as part of personal protective equipment by healthcare and other workers; these should continue to be reserved for those who need them to protect against risks in their workplace such as health and care workers and those in industrial settings like those exposed to dust hazards. <SEP> 7.2 Should people wear face coverings on public transport? <EOS>

Keeping children at home can lower stress created by social distancing and mask recommendations. Reach out to others for help in running essential errands.
Behavioral techniques can be used to address behavioral challenges and to develop new routines. These include social stories, video modeling, picture schedules, and visual cues. Try rewarding your child in small ways with his or her favorite non-food treat or activities to help switch routines and to follow recommendations.
Many of the organizations you turn to for information and support around your child’s complex, chronic medical condition may have information on their websites to help families address issues related to COVID-19.
Your child’s therapist(s) and teachers may also have resources to help successfully introduce new routines to your child.
While learning at home, continue special education services, accommodations, or services received in school through your child’s 504 plan or Individualized Educational Plan (IEP), as much as possible. Many schools are continuing interventions like speech therapy, small group classes, extended time and more. Learn more about supporting children with distance learning.

 AHCCCS intends for the Executive Order to apply to all AHCCCS and/or Medicaid funded permanent supportive and transitional housing programs as well as services settings in which AHCCCS members pay for room and board such as BHRFs, assisted living facilities, and group homes. Residential stability is critical for members to comply with mandated stay at home orders. To this end, there should be no disruption of service or alteration of existing subsidies for persons residing in AHCCCS funded Permanent Supportive and Transitional Living programs for persons determined SMI. Similarly, these protections should be broadly applied to any service setting whereby AHCCCS members pay for room and board. <SEP>  How does Governor Ducey’s March 24th Executive Order freezing all evictions in Arizona related to COVID for 120 days affect persons determined Seriously Mentally Ill (SMI) or persons with behavioral health needs (GMH/SU) in AHCCCS supported residential programs, including Permanent Supportive Housing, and/or Behavioral Health Residential Facilities (BHRFs), in which members pay room and board? <EOS>

On August 3, 2020, the Protecting Nonprofits from Catastrophic Cash Flow Strain Act was enacted into law. This Act amends the CARES Act and now allows for reimbursable employers that are eligible to receive reimbursement to only pay 50% of the amount due on eligible benefit charges. Previously the CARES Act required that 100% of the benefit charges for the billing period be paid before the 50% reimbursement could be applied. The Department will post the reimbursement to the billing period once the funding for that billing period has been received from the US Treasury. The reimbursement amount will be reflected as a payment/credit on your account and will be applied to the appropriate billing period. If an over-payment exists after the 50% reimbursement is applied, a credit will be created that may be used to pay future benefit charge amounts due. <SEP> ​I did not pay the Reimbursable Solvency Fee for Calendar Year 2020.

Ideally, all patients with COVID-19 are cared for in a healthcare facility. However, there may be some circumstances where patients may not require hospitalization or inpatient care is unavailable or unsafe, such as when capacity is insufficient to meet the demand for healthcare services.

While the likelihood of becoming infected with the COVID-19 virus from mail, newspapers, or packages is low, the CDC says it's a good idea to wipe them down with a disinfecting cloth that contains bleach.
Out of an abundance of caution during the pandemic, when handling or reading your mail, the newspaper, or packages, it would be best to avoid touching your face. Also, wash your hands with soap and water after handling, and keep them in one spot in your home.
A recent study found that the COVID-19 virus can remain viable on cardboard for about 24 hours, and up to 3 days on plastic.

No. The state of North Carolina is guided by data and facts in making decisions regarding COVID-19. Enough of the key indicators are leveling or moving in the right direction to make this transition to Safer At Home Phase 2. Public health experts’ analysis indicates that if restrictions are eased gradually with safety practices still in place, North Carolina may benefit from increased economic activity without a surge in new cases that would exceed our heath care system’s ability to respond.
Despite this progress, COVID-19 remains a highly contagious virus and state officials continue to monitor key metrics. COVID-19 spreads from person to person easily, especially indoors or if people come in close contact (less than 6 feet apart) for more than 10 minutes. If key indicators move in the wrong direction, restrictions may be put back into place. <SEP> Does this mean that residents of North Carolina are safe from COVID-19? <EOS>

This interim guidance is intended for women who are confirmed to have COVID-19 or are persons-under-investigation (PUI) for COVID-19 and are currently breastfeeding. This interim guidance is based on what is currently known about COVID-19 and the transmission of other viral respiratory infections. CDC will update this interim guidance as needed as additional information becomes available. For breastfeeding guidance in the immediate postpartum setting, refer to Interim Considerations for Infection Prevention and Control of 2019 Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Inpatient Obstetric Healthcare Settings.
Transmission of COVID-19 through breast milk
Much is unknown about how COVID-19 is spread. Person-to-person spread is thought to occur mainly via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza (flu) and other respiratory pathogens spread. In limited studies on women with COVID-19 and another coronavirus infection, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV), the virus has not been detected in breast milk; however we do not know whether mothers with COVID-19 can transmit the virus via breast milk.
CDC breastfeeding guidance for other infectious illnesses
Breast milk provides protection against many illnesses. There are rare exceptions when breastfeeding or feeding expressed breast milk is not recommended. CDC has no specific guidance for breastfeeding during infection with similar viruses like SARS-CoV or Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV).
Outside of the immediate postpartum setting, CDC recommends that a mother with flu continue breastfeeding or feeding expressed breast milk to her infant while taking precautions to avoid spreading the virus to her infant.
Guidance on breastfeeding for mothers with confirmed COVID-19 or under investigation for COVID-19
Breast milk is the best source of nutrition for most infants. However, much is unknown about COVID-19. Whether and how to start or continue breastfeeding should be determined by the mother in coordination with her family and healthcare providers. A mother with confirmed COVID-19 or who is a symptomatic PUI should take all possible precautions to avoid spreading the virus to her infant, including washing her hands before touching the infant and wearing a face mask, if possible, while feeding at the breast. If expressing breast milk with a manual or electric breast pump, the mother should wash her hands before touching any pump or bottle parts and follow recommendations for proper pump cleaning after each use. If possible, consider having someone who is well feed the expressed breast milk to the infant.

In one study, about 4 in 5 people with confirmed coronavirus in China were likely infected by people who didn’t know they had it, according to research published in the journal “Science.”
“These findings explain the rapid geographic spread of (coronavirus) and indicate containment of this virus will be particularly challenging,” researchers wrote.
In mid-March, the CDC said almost half of the 712 people with coronavirus who were on the Diamond Princess cruise ship didn’t have any symptoms when they tested positive.
And recent studies suggest 25% to 50% of coronavirus carriers don’t have symptoms.
In the US, “I think it could be as many as 1 in 3 walking around asymptomatic,” said New Jersey primary care physician Dr. Alex Salerno.
“We have tested some patients that have known exposure to COVID (coronavirus disease). They did not have temperature. Their pulse/(oxygen) was OK.”
Aside from social distancing and frequent hand washing, Salerno said more testing of people without symptoms is essential.
When asymptomatic carriers test positive, “we isolate them, and we separate them from the people who are not positive,” Salerno said. If more asymptomatic people got tested, “we could get people back to work safely.”
But there haven’t been nearly enough tests in the US for everyone who wants one, due to shortages, delays and faulty test kits. <SEP> How many people with coronavirus don't have symptoms? Are they still contagious? <EOS>
The White House recommends cities and metropolitan areas reopen their economies in a three-phased approach, and that they meet several key “gating criteria” before entering the initial reopening phase. To summarize, these criteria are: 
A downward trajectory of (a) reported influenza-like illnesses within a 14-day period AND (b) of reported COVID-like syndromic cases within a 14-day period,
A downward trajectory of documented COVID cases OR positive COVID tests as a percent of total tests within a 14-day period,
Demonstrated ability of hospitals to treat all patients without crisis care AND a robust testing regime for at-risk health care workers 
Cities and metropolitan areas should only begin to reopen—and in a gradual fashion—after meeting the criteria outlined above. Each subsequent reopening should only be undertaken if regions continue to make progress against these metrics even as more and more individuals reenter public life. See https://www.whitehouse.gov/openingamerica/ for further details. The White House notes that localities and states should “tailor” their application of this criteria, given that experiences with COVID-19 vary widely across the country. Moreover, local leaders should note that their respective states might have additional recommendations or requirements that they might also need to consider. 
On May 20th, the CDC released additional recommendations for reopening, including metrics and industry-specific considerations. (Dr. Josh Sharfstein, 5/27/20) <SEP> What are the federal public health recommendations for what data cities need to be tracking? <EOS>
No, the hotel cannot require that the homeless person disclose their status.  A person suspected or confirmed to be ill with COVID-19 by laboratory test should notify contacts who have been exposed so that the contacts can quarantine themselves for 14 days. The community service organization who placed the ill or infected person will assist with communication of information, the initiation of isolation for that person, and quarantine of suspected contacts.
A person who does not have symptoms of COVID-19 and does not have a positive laboratory test for the virus has no responsibility to share information about this virus with others.  Information about health conditions can remain confidential and should be protected.  It should be shared only at the discretion of the individual and to healthcare providers who need the information to provide necessary medical care services. <SEP> If a community service group is trying to place a homeless person in a hotel, can the hotel require that the homeless person disclose their COVID-19 status? <EOS>
 Based on evidence that has become recently available, and with the increased spread of COVID-19, FDA believes an appropriately validated single viral target SARS-CoV-2 assay could provide acceptable performance.

Encourage students and staff to take everyday preventive actions to prevent the spread of respiratory illnesses. These actions include staying home when sick; appropriately covering coughs and sneezes; cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces; and washing hands often with soap and water.

The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is primarily transmitted through droplets containing virus, or through viral particles that float in the air. The virus may be breathed in directly and can also spread when a person touches a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touches their mouth, nose, or eyes. There is no current evidence that the COVID-19 virus is transmitted through food.Safety precautions help you avoid breathing in coronavirus or touching a contaminated surface and touching your face.In the grocery store, maintain at least six feet of distance between yourself and other shoppers. Wipe frequently touched surfaces like grocery carts or basket handles with disinfectant wipes. Avoid touching your face. Wearing a cloth mask helps remind you not to touch your face and can further help reduce spread of the virus. Use hand sanitizer before leaving the store. Wash your hands as soon as you get home.If you are older than 65 or at increased risk for any reason, limit trips to the grocery store. Ask a neighbor or friend to pick up groceries and leave them outside your house. See if your grocery store offers special hours for older adults or those with underlying conditions. Or have groceries delivered to your home. <SEP> What precautions can I take when grocery shopping? <EOS>
Viruses survive outside our bodies because of how they are built. Specifically, they are pieces of genetic material (RNA or DNA) contained in a special coating of proteins called capsids. Viruses cannot replicate unless absorbed by cells in our body. Once a virus is outside the body, its capsid starts to degrade, and the more degraded its capsid is, the less likely it is to survive. When outside the body, these capsids degrade faster in cold, dry environments. They also degrade faster on soft, rather than on hard surfaces. That's because they need moisture to survive and soft surfaces absorb that moisture.

The policy or legislation needs to be clear regarding who is eligible for the funding and what information is needed to process an application for the funds. We’ve been advocating with policymakers to make sure the requirements for completing these applications or applying for funds are not too onerous because when we do that, we automatically eliminate certain groups of people who may not have access to the information or the technology needed to complete the applications and submit them in a timely manner. 
One strategy to increase equity in the distribution of funds would be to engage volunteers who have expertise in completing these kinds of applications to support organizations that may not be accustomed to completing complex computerized applications with a lot of required documentation.

Yes. All age groups can catch COVID-19. While we are still learning about how COVID-19 affects people, older persons (e.g. persons over 60 years) and persons with pre-existing medical conditions, like high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes, appear to develop serious illness more often than others. As this is a new virus, we are still learning about how it affects children and adolescents. Evidence to date suggests that children and adolescents are less likely to get severe disease, but severe cases and death can still happen in these age groups.Read more:https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/key-messages-and-actions-for-covid-19-prevention-and-control-in-schools-march-2020.pdf?sfvrsn=baf81d52_4https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses <SEP> Can adolescents catch COVID-19? <EOS>

 As stated in Section IV.C of the FDA's Policy for Coronavirus Disease-2019 Tests, the FDA does not intend to object to a commercial manufacturer's development and distribution to clinical laboratories of diagnostic test kits to perform assays to detect SARS-CoV-2 for a reasonable period of time after the manufacturer's validation of the test and while the manufacturer is preparing its EUA request where the manufacturer provides instructions for use of the test and posts data about the test's performance characteristics on the manufacturer's website. Transparency can help mitigate potential adverse impacts from a poorly designed test by facilitating better informed decisions by potential purchasers and users. As noted in the guidance, the believes that 15 business days is a reasonable period of time to prepare an EUA submission for a test whose performance characteristics have already been validated. Unless and until an EUA is issued that authorizes additional testing environments for a specific test, under CLIA, use of that test is limited to laboratories certified to perform high-complexity testing, including testing at the point-of-care when the site is covered by the laboratory's CLIA certificate for high-complexity testing. This policy does not apply to at home testing, including at-home specimen collection.
The commercial manufacturers listed below have notified FDA that they have validated and intend to distribute diagnostic test kits as set forth in Section IV.C of the FDA's Policy for Coronavirus Disease-2019 Tests. Where the Authorization Status is "FDA Authorized," the FDA reviewed and issued an EUA for the test after notification was given. Where the Authorization Status is shown as "Not FDA Authorized," the FDA has not yet reviewed the manufacturer's validation and issued an EUA for the test, and the test is included in this list to provide transparency regarding the notification submitted to FDA. The "Setting for Use" designation of "H" refers to a laboratory certified under CLIA to perform high-complexity testing. Certain developers have completed the EUA process prior to offering a test for clinical use rather than notify FDA under this policy. Tests that have been issued an EUA can be found on the EUA page.
If an EUA request is not submitted within a reasonable period of time, or if significant problems are identified with a test and cannot be addressed in a timely manner, the FDA intends to remove the manufacturer and test from this list, would expect the manufacturer to suspend distribution and conduct a recall of the test, and may take additional actions as appropriate.

Persons with COVID-19 who have symptoms and were directed to care for themselves at home may discontinue isolation under the following conditions:

At least 10 days* have passed since symptom onset and
At least 24 hours have passed since resolution of fever without the use of fever-reducing medications and
Other symptoms have improved.

*A limited number of persons with severe illness may produce replication-competent  virus beyond 10 days, that may warrant extending duration of isolation for up to 20 days after symptom onset. Consider consultation with infection control experts.
Persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 who never develop COVID-19 symptoms may discontinue isolation and other precautions 10 days after the date of their first positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.

As of July 2, indoor portions of libraries can reopen at 25% capacity, while following appropriate mitigation requirements.
Reopening plans vary by library. Please check with your local library for more details on hours and procedures.
Libraries offering curbside pickup services must follow appropriate mitigation requirements detailed in section 2 on page 5 of Administrative Order 2020-15. Libraries opening indoor spaces must institute mitigation requirements detailed in section 7 on page 13 of Executive Order No. 157.
What to Expect at Libraries
The following summarizes some of the protocols contained in AO 2020-15 and EO 157. However, this summary is not a replacement for fully complying with the terms of AO 2020-15 and EO 157 and libraries should read the full guidance carefully to ensure full compliance.
Libraries opening indoor and outdoor spaces must institute the following policies:

Limit total capacity of any outdoor area to a number that ensures that all individuals can remain six feet apart;
Limit the number of patrons in any indoor premises to 25 percent capacity – excluding employees;
Require workers and customers to wear cloth face coverings while indoors and in outdoor spaces, except where doing so would inhibit that individual's health or where the individual is under two years of age;
If a customer refuses to wear a cloth face covering for non-medical reasons then the business must decline the individual entry into the indoor premises;
Limit occupancy in restrooms that remain open to avoid over-crowding and maintain social distancing through signage and, where practicable, the utilization of attendants to monitor capacity; and
Provide sanitization materials, such as hand sanitizer and sanitizing wipes, to customers.

For full details, see section 2 on page 5 of Administrative Order 2020-15 and section 7 on page 13 of Executive Order No. 157.

As of July 2, indoor and outdoor pools can both reopen, subject to mitigation protocols.
Summer camps will be able to use their pools when they reopen on July 6.
Pools must follow the appropriate requirements from Executive Order No. 153, Executive Order No. 157, and the Department of Health's Executive Directive 20-022 and COVID-19 Pools and Aquatic Recreation Facility Standards, including developing and implementing a COVID-19 Pool Operation Prevention Plan that must be submitted to and approved by the local health authority.
What to Expect at Pools
The following summarizes some of the protocols contained in EO 153, EO 157, and DOH ED 20-022 and Pools and Aquatic Recreation Facility Standards. However, this summary is not a replacement for fully complying with the terms of EO 153, EO 157, DOH ED 20-022, and DOH standards and businesses should read the full guidance carefully to ensure full compliance.
Health and safety standards required for reopening pools include:

Staff must be screened for fever and symptoms on entering.
Facilities must stagger access to entry and exit points to avoid congregation, and reduce capacity to 50% for the facility and grounds.
Staff and pool-goers must wear a cloth face covering outside of the pool when social distancing of six feet cannot be maintained, with the exception of children under age 2 and lifeguards on active duty - face coverings should NOT be allowed in the water due to increased risk of drowning.
Encouraging 6 feet social distancing while in the water and on the pool deck, unless the individual needs help in order to swim, except immediate family members, caretakers, household members, or romantic partners;
A sign-in sheet, which may be electronic, is to be maintained for all staff and patrons to facilitate potential contact tracing efforts.
Patrons can use their own water play equipment, such as goggles, snorkels, fins, kickboards, pool noodles and toys, but sharing is prohibited and such equipment cannot be rented for patrons' use.
Limit occupancy in restrooms, shower areas, and locker rooms that remain open to avoid over-crowding and maintain social distancing through signage.

In addition, indoor pool facilities must:

Limit people in indoor areas to 25 percent of the establishment's indoor capacity
Restrict lap swimming to one direction per lane or one swimmer per lane

No, although RNA fragments of SARS-CoV-2 were detected in blood of symptomatic COVID-19 patients, this does not mean that the virus is viable/infectious. In general, respiratory viruses are not known to be transmitted by blood transfusion. Blood centers should have routine blood donor screening measures in place to prevent individuals with respiratory symptoms or fever from donating blood.  As precautionary measures, blood centers might encourage self-deferral of those with travel history to an COVID-19 affected country in the previous 14 days, or of those who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 or are close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case. <SEP> Should blood centers routinely screen blood products for COVID-19 virus? <EOS>
Accumulating evidence supports ending isolation and precautions for persons with COVID-19 using a symptom-based strategy. Specifically, researchers have reported that people with mild to moderate COVID-19 remain infectious no longer than 10 days after their symptoms began, and those with more severe illness or those who are severely immunocompromised remain infectious no longer than 20 days after their symptoms began. Therefore, CDC has updated the recommendations for discontinuing home isolation as follows:
Persons with COVID-19 who have symptoms and were directed to care for themselves at home may discontinue isolation under the following conditions:

At least 10 days* have passed since symptom onset and
At least 24 hours have passed since resolution of fever without the use of fever-reducing medications and
Other symptoms have improved.

*A limited number of persons with severe illness or immunosuppression may produce replication-competent virus beyond 10 days, that may warrant extending the duration of isolation for up to 20 days after symptom onset. Consider consultation with infection control experts.
Persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 who never develop COVID-19 symptoms may discontinue isolation and other precautions 10 days after the date of their first positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
The role of testing:
RT-PCR testing for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA for discontinuing isolation could be considered for persons who are severely immunocompromised, in consultation with infectious disease experts. For all others, a test-based strategy is no longer recommended except to discontinue isolation or other precautions earlier than would occur under the symptom-based strategy outlined above.
The test-based strategy requires negative results using RT-PCR for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA under an FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for COVID-19 from at least two consecutive respiratory specimens collected ≥24 hours apart (total of two negative specimens).† See Interim Guidelines for Collecting, Handling, and Testing Clinical Specimens from Persons for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
†All test results should be final before isolation is ended. Testing guidance is based on limited information and is subject to change as more information becomes available.

DELIVERIES
Packages
There is low risk of spread from products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient temperatures.
COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly through close contact from person-to-person. It may be possible for COVID-19 to spread in other ways, but these are not thought to be the main ways the virus spreads including from touching surfaces or objects.
When accepting deliveries, residents should maintain proper social distancing practices by staying six feet apart to minimize contact. If it is possible to designate an area for packages to be dropped off, such as a front porch, please do so.
Out of an abundance of caution, when handling or reading your mail, the newspaper, or packages, it would be best to avoid touching your face. Also, wash your hands with soap and water after handling, and keep them in one spot in your home.
Food Deliveries and Takeout
Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person through respiratory droplets. Currently, there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food.
Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day, wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen temperatures.
For more on how COVID-19 spreads, visit the CDC's resource page.
IN-HOME SERVICES
For critical services that cannot be postponed and must be performed within your home, such as heating or plumbing repairs, residents should maintain proper social distancing practices by staying six feet apart.
Individuals and workers are strongly encouraged to wear a face covering, and frequently touched surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected after services have been completed. For more details on how to properly clean and disinfect surfaces, see the CDC's guidelines.

The infectious period may begin one to two days before symptoms appear, but people are likely most infectious during the symptomatic period, even if symptoms are mild and very non-specific. The infectious period is now estimated to last for 7-12 days in moderate cases and up to two weeks on average in severe cases. <SEP> 5. When is a person infectious? <EOS>
People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus
               even if they don't have any symptoms. This happens when an infected person sneezes
               or coughs, sending tiny droplets into the air. These can land in the nose or mouth
               of someone nearby.
Coronavirus may also spread when someone breathes in tiny airborne particles (called
               aerosols) that contain the virus. People with COVID-19 can send aerosols into the
               air when they talk or breathe. These can stay in the air for up to 3 hours.
The closer you get to someone with COVID-19 and the longer you are together, the
               higher your risk of getting infected.
People also may be able to be infected if they touch an infected droplet on a surface
               and then touch their own nose, mouth, or eyes.
Experts are looking at whether the virus can spread through stool (poop). <SEP> How Does Coronavirus (COVID-19) Spread? <EOS>

the beneficiary, your child, has COVID-19 symptoms. (Exception: testing for active duty service members).

Testing locations (sites/labs) have to be TRICARE-authorized for TRICARE to pay on the claim.
CDC guidance:

CDC does not currently recommend universal symptom screenings (screening all students grades K-12) be conducted by schools.
Parents or caregivers should be strongly encouraged to monitor their children for signs of infectious illness every day.
Students who are sick should not attend school in-person.

Per DoD, if your child has no symptoms or no recent exposure to COVID-19, you should visit your local or state health department’s website for COVID-19 testing information.
Getting a COVID-19 test is not guaranteed by the local or state health departments.  Many civilian clinics and hospitals are following CDC guidance and are not testing asymptomatic individuals.

Elective Surgeries and Procedures
What’s happening with other appointments and elective procedures at military treatment facilities? 
Background:
On March 24, 2020, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs released a policy.  It directed postponement of all elective surgeries and procedures. The reasons for the policy change:

Conserve personal protective equipment,
Apply critical resources (people and equipment) to meet COVID-19 care requirements, and
Protect patients and staff from COVID-19.  

There were two exceptions to the policy. You could have surgery or a procedure if:
(1)    It impacted your ability as an active duty service member to deploy, or your medical readiness status
(2)    Delaying it increased the risk to your health to an unacceptable level.  Your provider makes this determination. <SEP> Will TRICARE cover testing if my child needs a test before returning to school? <EOS>
If you have fully recovered from COVID-19, you may be able to help patients currently fighting the infection by donating your plasma. Because you fought the infection, your plasma now contains COVID-19 antibodies. These antibodies provided one way for your immune system to fight the virus when you were sick, so your plasma may be able to be used to help others fight off the disease.

Experts say it’s due to cuts in federal funding for public health and problems with early testing. 
Problems with public health infrastructure: Two years ago, the CDC stopped funding epidemic prevention activities in 39 countries, including China. This happened because the Trump administration refused to allocate money to a program that started during the 2014 Ebola outbreak. 
Former CDC director Dr. Tom Frieden warned that move “would significantly increase the chance an epidemic will spread without our knowledge and endanger lives in our country and around the world.”
Problems with the testing: Malfunctions, shortages and delays in availability have all contributed to the slowdown. 
In the first few weeks of the outbreak in the US, the CDC was the only facility in the country that could confirm test results — even though a World Health Organization test became available around the same time. 
Some test kits that were sent around the country were flawed — a move that put the US behind about “four to five weeks,” says Dr. Rob Davidson, executive director of the Committee to Protect Medicare. <SEP> Why has the US been so far behind other countries with testing? <EOS>

To protect Americans from serious infectious diseases and other health threats, public health authorities conduct national case surveillance to monitor more than 120 diseases and conditions. For these conditions, public health collects information on individuals with the infection in a population, which is known as case surveillance. The goal of case surveillance is to provide information necessary to control outbreaks and inform public health action. Case surveillance is especially important for new diseases, such as COVID-19, in order to understand the similarities and differences between cases, including:

demographic, clinical, and epidemiologic characteristics,
exposure and contact history, and
course of clinical illness and care received.

During the COVID-19 response, state and jurisdictional health departments voluntarily report to CDC using the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System. Data about COVID-19 cases are sent to CDC without personal identifiers, such as names or home addresses. A national standardized case definition is used to define confirmed and probable cases and deaths.

For countries not currently known to be experiencing community transmission of COVID-19, the priority consideration will be whether the planned mass gathering event substantially increases the risk of the virus entering the country and becoming established, as well as the risk for participants to importing infection back to their home country and further increasing global spread. In making this assessment, the organizers and their national or local health authorities should recognize that the risk of imported cases of COVID-19 is naturally linked to international travel. They should also recognize that it is neither realistic or desirable to aim for zero risk. When organizers and health authorities are determining whether to hold a mass gathering, they should determine what is an acceptable risk and what additional measures should be implemented to mitigate the risks.For countries where COVID-19 has already started to spread in the community, key consideration will be: aiming at containing or at least slowing down the spread of the virus in the local community/country.preventing participants from other countries being infected with COVID-19  In each case the risk should be considered in the context of the known features of COVID-19, its severity, its transmissibility and the effectiveness of measures to prevent or reduce transmission. The strain already placed on the local health system in responding to COVID-19 outbreak(s), and the additional strain the mass gathering might place on the system also need to be taken into account.You can find more advice on what to look at in the WHO document Key planning recommendations for Mass Gatherings in the context of the current COVID-19 outbreak of 14 February 2020. See: https://www.who.int/publications-detail/key-planning-recommendations-for-mass-gatherings-in-the-context-of-the-current-covid-19-outbreak <SEP> What factors should organizers and health authorities look at when assessing whether the risks are acceptable or not? <EOS>
Functioning critical infrastructurepdf iconexternal icon is imperative during the response to the COVID-19 emergency, for both public health and safety as well as community well-being. When continuous remote work is not possible, critical infrastructure businesses should use strategies to reduce the likelihood of spreading the disease. This includes, but is not necessarily limited to, separating staff by off-setting shift hours or days and implementing social distancing. These steps can preserve and protect the workforce and allow operations to continue.
To ensure continuity of operations of essential functions, CDC advises that critical infrastructure employees may be permitted to continue work following potential exposure to COVID-19, provided they remain asymptomatic and additional safety practices are implemented to protect them and the community. However, reintegrating exposed, asymptomatic employees to onsite operations, while discussed in the critical infrastructure guidance, should not be misinterpreted as always being the first or most appropriate option to pursue in managing critical work tasks. Staying home may still be the most preferred and protective option for exposed employees. Critical infrastructure businesses have an obligation to limit, to the extent possible, the reintegration of in-person employees who have experienced an exposure to COVID-19 but remain symptom-free in ways that best protect the health of the employee, their co-employees, and the general public.
Create a critical infrastructure sector response plan. Cross-training employees to perform critical job functions so the workplace can operate even if key employees are absent and match critical job functions with other equally skilled and available employees who have not experienced an exposure to COVID-19.
Critical infrastructure employees who have been exposed but remain symptom-free and must return to in-person work should adhere to the following practices before and during their work shift:

Pre-screen for symptoms
Monitor regularly for symptoms
Wear a cloth face covering
Practice social distancing
Clean and disinfect workspaces

Employees with symptoms should be sent home and should not return to the workplace until they have met the criteria to discontinue home isolation.

Current CDC recommendations advise individuals with COVID-19 symptoms or diagnoses to isolate at home to protect family members or roommates: “as much as possible, stay in a specific room and away from other people and pets in your home.” This may be very difficult for some city residents, however, due to crowded living situations. Some countries, such as China, Hong Kong, and Singapore have created alternative sites for the isolation of people who test positive for COVID-19. For those who are sick but do not require intensive care in a hospital setting, these facilities can be safe places to isolate and recuperate. Strong medical protocols and oversight should be in place to support people who develop more severe illness.
Some cities have set up specialized quarantine facilities in hotels and offered hotel rooms at no cost or at a deep discount for frontline for healthcare workers to reduce their risk of infecting others in their homes. Additionally, many cities have begun to house homeless residents in hotels to curb the spread of the virus. 
In California, the state announced that more than 150 hotels have been part of a bulk purchasing of room program that will give healthcare workers the opportunity to stay closer to their facilities at no-cost or at deep discounts. The program will prioritize health care workers who come in direct contact with or are suspected of having direct contact with COVID-19 patients, or who test positive for COVID-19 but do not require hospitalization. 
Another population in need of support for isolation and quarantine are individuals experiencing homelessness. Virginia has announced a $2.5 million program to temporarily house 1,500 homeless residents who are currently in shelters, have no shelter, or are in situations where social distancing is not possible.

Within the community the use of face masks is recommended in indoor settings when it is not possible to maintain physical distancing. However, in school settings, implementing this measure is challenging, as it is known that children have a lower tolerance to wearing masks for extended periods of time, and may fail to use the masks properly.
In primary schools, the use of face masks is recommended for teachers and other adults when physical distancing cannot be guaranteed, although it is not recommended for the students. In secondary schools, the use of face masks is recommended for both students and adults. The use of masks should be seen as a complementary measure, rather than a single measure to prevent transmission within schools.
Physical distancing, safe coughing etiquette, hand hygiene, and staying at home when ill are all still important measures for reducing infection, irrespective of whether masks are being used within schools. <SEP> 9. Should children and teachers wear masks in schools? <EOS>
Yes. The case count reported by MDH does not account for all cases because a person with COVID-19 may not feel sick or get tested. It is important that all Minnesotans take precautions.

If a student or employee experiences symptoms of COVID-19 while at school, move the individual out of the classroom or group setting, isolate in a predetermined location, and inform the school nurse or school health staff member. School health staff must wear personal protective equipment (PPE), including N-95 face mask or surgical face mask, goggles and gloves before entering into the room to evaluate the individual. Call the parent or family member of the employee to pick up and take home for 14 days of self quarantine before returning to school. If symptoms persist or worsen they should contact their healthcare provider.
If there is a confirmed case of COVID 19 in school, the local health department will work closely with school administrators to determine a course of action for their schools. Schools should follow the CDC Interim Guidance for K-12 for schools and use the School Decision Tree to determine school closing in collaboration with the local health department. Schools should follow CDC/EPA guidelines (PDF) for cleaning/disinfecting of space or CDC, Everyday Steps, Steps When Someone is Sick, and Considerations for Employers. The VDH will work closely with the school to make environmental cleaning recommendations, conduct contact tracing, and investigate any potential exposures. <SEP> What should schools do if an individual is experiencing flu-like or COVID-19 symptoms? <EOS>
To date there is no epidemiological information to suggest
that contact with goods, products or vehicles shipped from COVID-19 affected
countries have been the source of COVID-19 in humans.For these reasons, there is no disinfection recommendations
for any goods and products coming from COVID-19 affected countries given that
there is no available evidence that these products pose a risk to public
health. WHO will continue to closely monitor the evolution of
COVID-19, and will update the recommendations as needed. <SEP> What are the recommendation regarding disinfection of vehicles, goods and products coming from China or other COVID-19 affected countries? <EOS>
CDC does not have any evidence to suggest that imported animals or animal products pose a risk for spreading COVID-19 in the United States. This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available. CDC, the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) play distinct but complementary roles in regulating the importation of live animals and animal products into the United States.

CDC regulates animals and animal products that pose a threat to human health,
USDA regulateexternal icon animals and animal products that pose a threat to agriculture; and
FWS regulatesexternal icon importation of endangered species and wildlife that can harm the health and welfare of humans, the interests of agriculture, horticulture, or forestry, and the welfare and survival of wildlife resources. <SEP> What about imported animals or animal products? <EOS>
Many recovered persons do not have detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in upper respiratory tract specimens. However, viral RNA can be persistently detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in respiratory tract samples in some persons after apparent clinical recovery.  In some persons, after testing negative by RT-PCR in two consecutive samples, later samples can test positive again. These persistent detections of viral RNA usually are associated with higher cycle threshold (Ct) values (i.e., fewer RNA copies) than Ct values found in RT-PCR results from samples collected shortly before or during clinical illness. Studies that have examined how long SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in adults have demonstrated that, in some persons, it can be detected for weeks. <SEP> What do we know about detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA after clinical recovery from COVID-19? <EOS>
Once a person is infected with SARS-CoV-2, the PCR test may not show the presence of the virus for 5 days after exposure. So you could have it, but the test may not show it for awhile. Timing is key for getting a positive test result. <SEP> After being exposed, when will a person test positive? <EOS>
The key to slowing the spread of COVID-19 and decreasing risk to others is to practice social distancing. While school is out, children should not have in-person playdates with children from other households. If children are playing outside their own homes, it is essential that they remain 6 feet from anyone who is not in their own household. To help children maintain social connections while social distancing, help your children have supervised phone calls or video chats with their friends. Make sure children practice everyday preventive behaviors, such as washing their hands often with soap and water. Remember, if children meet outside of school in groups, it can put everyone at risk. <SEP> When school’s out can my child hang out with their friends? <EOS>

Yes, you can use soap and water on surfaces just like you would on your hands to kill coronavirus. But don’t use water alone — that won’t really help. 
The outer layer of the virus is made up of lipids, aka fat. Your goal is to break through that fatty barrier, forcing the virus’ guts to spill out and rendering it dead. 
In other words, imagine coronavirus is a butter dish that you’re trying to clean. 
“You try to wash your butter dish with water alone, but that butter is not coming off the dish,” said Dr. John Williams, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh. 
“You need some soap to dissolve grease. So soap or alcohol are very, very effective against dissolving that greasy liquid coating of the virus.”
By cutting through the greasy barrier, Williams said, “it physically inactivates the virus so it can’t bind to and enter human cells anymore.” <SEP> How does soap kill coronavirus? If I don’t have disinfecting wipes, can I use soap and water on surfaces? <EOS>
For COVID-19, a close contact is anyone who was within 6 feet of an infected person for at least 15 minutes.

No. The US Food and Drug Administration says you don’t need to wash fresh produce with soap and water, but you should rinse it with plain water. 
But it’s still important to wash your hands with soap and water frequently because we often touch our faces without realizing it. And that’s a very easy way for coronavirus to spread. 
You don’t have to worry about getting coronavirus by “eating” it, though. Even if coronavirus does get into your food, your stomach acid would kill it, said Dr. Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University. <SEP> Do I need to wash fruits and vegetables with soap and water? <EOS>

Wear masks in public settings when around people not living in your household and particularly where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain, such as grocery stores, pharmacies, and gas stations. Masks may slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others.
COVID-19 can be spread by people who do not have symptoms and do not know that they are infected. That’s why it’s important for everyone to practice social distancing (staying at least 6 feet away from other people) and wear masks in public settings. Masks provide an extra layer to help prevent the respiratory droplets from traveling in the air and onto other people.
The masks recommended are not surgical masks or N-95 respirators. Those are critical supplies that must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.
More information about masks can be found on our masks site.

Contact tracing is a tried and true public health method. We do it for TB, sexually transmitted diseases, HIV, and for vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles. There's a whole set of skills that goes along with it. Contact tracing involves building trust with the patient and quickly warning the patient’s contacts. We absolutely have to protect privacy and confidentiality. When it's done well, public health earns, gains, and maintains patient trust and is able to get the most sensitive information reliably from people. Public health departments all over the country are overwhelmed and can't imagine working at ten or a hundred times the scale to make this successful, but people working together to build trust and understanding is what makes this work.
One of the best examples we can look to is Singapore, where, for a population of a few million, a thousand people are doing this full time. They do a video conference with every case. They track down 30 to 40 contacts per case and warn them. This is an enormous effort. There are emerging best practices. We can share some materials that we put together from around the country and around the world. This is a moving target. (Dr. Tom Frieden, 4/21/20)
Mayors can be very helpful in getting health departments to understand and embrace the scale up that's necessary. Some state and local governments, such as Massachusetts, New Haven, and San Francisco, are partnering with nonprofits including academic medical centers that have local and global public health knowledge.
In other places, they're using city or county employees such as school nurses to do contact tracing. Other areas are reaching out to universities and getting hundreds of students involved right away. Sometimes with these local departments there’s a small team for the usual contact tracing on STDs and HIV, and mayors can connect them to resources to help them figure out how to scale up. (Dr. Josh Sharfstein, 4/21/20)
There are underutilized human resources right now. A lot of students have been let out of school early and are eager to volunteer. Local public health departments have been under-resourced for a long time, so there are not nearly enough professionals to do contact tracing. (Dr. Howard Koh, 4/21/20)
Resource: The national contact tracing plan released by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO) recommends deploying over 100,000 contract tracers for a 12-month deployment, with Congress appropriating about $3.6 billion in emergency funding for state and local public health departments. <SEP> How can we scale up contact tracing? <EOS>
There is still a lot that is unknown about the newly emerged COVID-19 and how it spreads. In general, because of poor survivability of other coronaviruses, such as SARS and MERS, on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient temperatures. Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with shipped goods and there have not been any cases of COVID-19 in the United States associated with shipped goods. <SEP> I ordered from an online store.

No. All OSHA requirements for  respiratory protection in construction that were in place before the COVID-19  pandemic remain in place. Under OSHA's Respiratory Protection standard for  construction (29 CFR 1926.103), employers must follow 29 CFR 1910.134 the general industry respiratory protection standard.  Similarly, employers must continue to follow requirements in other OSHA  standards, including those that require respiratory protection to protect  workers from exposures to certain chemicals and other hazardous substances.
OSHA recognizes that employers and  workers in construction may not always be able to get the personal protective  equipment they need because of shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic. OSHA is providing  temporary enforcement discretion around the requirements of certain standards, including the Respiratory Protection standard (29 CFR 1910.134). The enforcement guidance describes criteria for enforcement discretion  when employers make good-faith efforts to get National Institute for  Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)–certified  N95 filtering facepiece respirators or other appropriate NIOSH-certified respirators  and are unable to do so. 
NIOSH guidance describes options for extended use and reuse of respirators, using  expired respirators or respirators certified under the standards of other countries  or jurisdictions, and other options for protecting workers who need respirators  on the job. More information is available in the COVID-19 enforcement guidance on  the Enforcement Memos page. Employers  should regularly check the Standards page of OSHA's  COVID-19 Safety and Health Topics page for updates on the status of these memoranda.

Importantly, MOST people with COVID-19 do well and recover fully within a week or two of their illness. Even though there are no specific treatments or vaccines for the COVID-19 virus at this time, most people are cured by their own immune system and recover fully.
Older adults (especially over age 60) and those with chronic medical conditions (such as obesity, heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, and lung disease) are at highest risk for getting pneumonia and requiring hospitalization from COVID-19. Patients with conditions that result in weak immune systems (from steroids, cancer drugs, organ or bone marrow transplants, etc.) may also be more susceptible to infection.

Serologic tests measure the antibody response in an individual.  Antibodies to COVID-19 are produced over days to weeks after infection with the virus. The presence of antibodies indicates that a person was infected with the COVID-19 virus, irrespective of whether the individual had severe or mild disease, or even asymptomatic infection. To accompany COVID-19 surveillance, seroepidemiologic studies are conducted to measure the extent of infection in the population among people who did not seek health care and were missed by current surveillance efforts because they either had no or mild symptoms. With any novel virus, including the COVID-19 virus, initial seroprevalence in the population is assumed to be negligible due to the virus being novel in origin. Therefore, surveillance of antibody seropositivity in a population can allow inferences to be made about the extent of infection and about the cumulative incidence of infection in the population. <SEP> What is serology? <EOS>
The speed of transmission is an important point of difference between the two viruses. Influenza has a shorter median incubation period (the time from infection to appearance of symptoms) and a shorter serial interval (the time between successive cases) than COVID-19 virus. The serial interval for COVID-19 virus is estimated to be 5-6 days, while for influenza virus, the serial interval is 3 days. This means that influenza can spread faster than COVID-19.   Further, transmission in the first 3-5 days of illness, or potentially pre-symptomatic transmission –transmission of the virus before the appearance of symptoms – is a major driver of transmission for influenza. In contrast, while we are learning that there are people who can shed COVID-19 virus 24-48 hours prior to symptom onset, at present, this does not appear to be a major driver of transmission.   The reproductive number – the number of secondary infections generated from one infected individual – is understood to be between 2 and 2.5 for COVID-19 virus, higher than for influenza. However, estimates for both COVID-19 and influenza viruses are very context and time-specific, making direct comparisons more difficult.   Children are important drivers of influenza virus transmission in the community. For COVID-19 virus, initial data indicates that children are less affected than adults and that clinical attack rates in the 0-19 age group are low. Further preliminary data from household transmission studies in China suggest that children are infected from adults, rather than vice versa.  While the range of symptoms for the two viruses is similar, the fraction with severe disease appears to be different. For COVID-19, data to date suggest that 80% of infections are mild or asymptomatic, 15% are severe infection, requiring oxygen and 5% are critical infections, requiring ventilation. These fractions of severe and critical infection would be higher than what is observed for influenza infection. Those most at risk for severe influenza infection are children, pregnant women, elderly, those with underlying chronic medical conditions and those who are immunosuppressed. For COVID-19, our current understanding is that older age and underlying conditions increase the risk for severe infection.  Mortality for COVID-19 appears higher than for influenza, especially seasonal influenza. While the true mortality of COVID-19 will take some time to fully understand, the data we have so far indicate that the crude mortality ratio (the number of reported deaths divided by the reported cases) is between 3-4%, the infection mortality rate (the number of reported deaths divided by the number of infections) will be lower. For seasonal influenza, mortality is usually well below 0.1%. However, mortality is to a large extent determined by access to and quality of health care. <SEP> How are COVID-19 and influenza viruses different? <EOS>
It is the question of the moment. If I were you thinking that through, I would do the scenario analysis. Then I would ask, what are the likely consequences of these choices in these four different future worlds? I would make my choice, and I would be watching all the time for me to be wrong about which world we're in.
You wouldn't say to the public, "I've done the scenario analysis, and this is what I think’s best." You'd say, "I think there are three possible futures we face, or four. In this future, saying there's no real problem or no real downside to resuming business as usual could get us into a really nasty situation. I'm gambling that it's future X, and so I'm making decision Y” (which is how an academic thinks). You don't need to explain it this way. Maybe that's just helpful for you and your team. But being clear with the public about why you're making your decision is important.
One of the goals of this analysis is understanding that the future may be different from what you expect. As time goes on, you want to be asking yourself, was I wrong about the future? At what stage do I say this was a mistake and back off in either direction? If you keep things shut down too long, you risk worsening your economic problems. If you open up too fast, you risk serious health consequences. That's the choice you face. Being able to say, or think, something like, "I think we'll have a vaccine in six months, so perhaps we can go a little bit faster” might be helpful.

Michigan residents can apply online for a free permit to cut fuelwood from dead and downed trees in approved areas of Michigan’s state forests. These permits, which normally cost $20 each, are being offered for free for the 2020 season as part of the agency's COVID-19 response. Permits are for up to five standard cords of wood. Wood must be dead and down within 200 feet of a road. Fuelwood cannot be resold or traded. Permits are valid for up to 90 days after the date they are downloaded and all permits expire Dec. 31. Households that have already submitted payment will have their checks returned via mail.
DNR staff recommends that you visit the site where you plan to cut before applying for a permit. The quality and quantity of dead wood varies by location. Current maps of areas where cutting will be allowed are available online. The permit form is at Michigan.gov/Fuelwood.

Routine cleaning is the everyday cleaning practices that businesses and communities normally use to maintain a healthy environment. Surfaces frequently touched by multiple people, such as door handles, bathroom surfaces, and handrails, should be cleaned with soap and water or another detergent at least daily when facilities are in use. More frequent cleaning and disinfection may be required based on level of use. For example, certain surfaces and objects in public spaces, such as shopping carts and point of sale keypads, should be cleaned and disinfected before each use. Cleaning removes dirt and impurities, including germs, from surfaces. Cleaning alone does not kill germs, but it reduces the number of germs on a surface. <SEP> What is routine cleaning? How frequently should facilities be cleaned to reduce the potential spread of COVID-19? <EOS>
Administrators should take the following actions to prevent a COVID-19 outbreak in their community or facility:

Promote social distancing

Cancel public or group activities and events
Inform workers and volunteers to avoid close contact with residents
When possible, limit visitors and volunteers to essential persons
Advise residents to stay home and avoid public places
Alter schedules to reduce mixing (e.g., stagger meal, activity, arrival/departure times)


Support residents in preparing

Establish the ‘buddy’ system to ensure residents stay connected.
Encourage residents to have extra medications and supplies.
Identify residents with unique needs and work with them to tailor these strategies.
Find ways to support residents in managing stress and anxiety.
Inform residents using print materials and high-visibility posters


Encourage everyone to take everyday preventive actions to prevent the spread of respiratory illnesses.

Cover coughs and sneezes
Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces
Wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds
Ensure hand hygiene supplies (e.g., hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol) are readily available in all buildings.


Monitor for cases and take action when someone is sick.

Screen workers and when possible volunteers
Ask residents to self-monitor for symptoms
Review the usual absenteeism patterns at your facility among staff, so you can identify if the rate of absenteeism increases.
Implement flexible sick-leave policies and actively encourage sick employees to stay home

No, you can not get tested for COVID-19 by taking yourself to a commercial laboratory. A commercial laboratory will not perform a COVID-19 test unless they have an order from a health care provider.
Commercial labs are offering COVID-19 testing to individuals who meet certain criteria. However, these tests are not available directly to the general public. They must be ordered by a health care provider, who will order the test from the lab or provide you with a prescription to show the laboratory.
You should not go to a commercial laboratory to seek COVID-19 testing unless your health care provider orders the test and tells you to go there. Work with your health care provider to coordinate testing.
All costs and fees associated with commercial laboratories are the responsibility of the patient.
Testing For COVID-19 Infection
To find out if you have COVID-19, visit any of the 250+ testing sites across the state.
Testing is now available to everyone in New Jersey. It's quick and easy. You don't need insurance and free testing is available.
Visit COVID19.nj.gov/testing to find a testing site near you.
It's especially important to get tested if:

You are experiencing symptoms (fever, cough, shortness of breath, chills, sore throat, muscle pain, shivering, headache, or new loss of taste or smell)
You have been in close contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19
You are an essential worker (health care worker, first responder, food service worker, or transit worker)
You were recently in a large crowd where social distancing was hard to maintain
You recently travelled to an area or a state with high COVID-19 infection rates

Yes. Management should continue to prevent mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B.
Pediatric Care of HBV-exposed Infants

Make every effort to ensure HBV-exposed infants complete the hepatitis B vaccine series following the ACIP recommendations (see https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/rr/rr6701a1.htm). Providers using single-component vaccine who are experiencing immunization service disruption should administer hepatitis B vaccine as close to the recommended intervals as possible, including series completion at 6 months, and follow ACIP recommendations for post-vaccination serologic testing.
If post-vaccination serologic testing is delayed beyond 6 months after the hepatitis B series is completed, consider administering a “booster” dose of single antigen hepatitis B vaccine and then ordering post-vaccination serologic testing (HBsAg & antibody to HBsAg [anti-HBs]) 1-2 months after the “booster” dose. <SEP> Should management of infants born to HBV-infected women continue during the COVID-19 pandemic? <EOS>

As COVID-19 rates across our state and region continue to increase, the County Health Officer is shifting to a new
    approach to contain the virus and protect the safety of our community. The July 2 Order imposes strict

A lessee is anyone who rents space from a personal service business. A common example would be an independent hair
    stylist who rents a chair or workstation from a hair salon. (A personal service business does not need to sign this
    agreement just because they rent their facility space from a landlord; instead, the agreement must be signed when
    the personal service business is the one renting out space.)
Lessees need to sign the agreement in the Personal Care Services Directive. Because they are running their own
    business independent from the salon, they also need to complete, submit, and implement their own
    Social Distancing Protocol. They also need to provide a copy of their Social Distancing Protocol to the salon. But
    they do not need to post their completed Protocol or any signage at their rented station or area (because the salon
    will have already posted the required signage at the facility).
Please note that on July 13, the State Health Officer ordered the closure of all indoor operations at personal
        care services businesses, hair salons, and barbershops in Santa Clara County. This means these
            businesses may only operate outdoors at this time. All outdoor operations are subject to the Health
        Officer’s Mandatory Directive for Personal Care Services Businesses and any applicable safety- and
        health-related regulatory requirements. <SEP> The Personal Care Services Directive requires lessees to sign an agreement when they lease or rent space from

Under the Process to Reopen Pennsylvania, and the Business Guidance, different occupancy limits apply to businesses based upon the nature of their business and the county in which they are located.
In the Green Phase of reopening, businesses that were permitted to operate in the Yellow Phase may increase their capacity to 75 percent of the total occupancy stated on their occupancy permit, while businesses that were not permitted to open in the Yellow Phase — such as movie theaters, gyms, arcades, and others — may operate at 50 percent of the total occupancy stated on their occupancy permit.
In addition to these general limitations, gatherings and events — such as meetings, weddings, catered events, concerts, conferences, fairs, festivals, sporting events, movie showings or theater performances, and similar events occurring within these businesses — are subject to specific conditions during each phase of reopening. Specifically, facilities and venues must limit the total number of individuals gathering at one time for any discrete gathering or event within the facility or venue.
Under the new orders issued on July 15, 2020, such gatherings for a planned or spontaneous event are limited to 25 individuals for each discrete gathering or event within the indoor facility or venue. Outdoor events are limited to 250 individuals.
Additionally, per the orders from July 15, 2020, all restaurants and bars must follow these restrictions:

All businesses in the retail food services industry, including restaurants, wineries, breweries, private clubs, and bars, are permitted to provide take-out and delivery sales of food, as well as dine-in service in both indoor and outdoor seating areas so long as they strictly adhere to the requirements of the guidance required by the order, including:

Prohibition from conducting operations unless the facility offers sit-down, dine-in meals, or is serving take-out sales of alcoholic beverages. All service must be at a table or booth; bar service is prohibited.
Alcohol only can be served for on-premises consumption when in the same transaction as a meal.
Take-out sales of alcohol for the purposes of off-site consumption are permitted subject to any limitations or restrictions imposed by Pennsylvania law.
Non-bar seating in outdoor areas (i.e. tables or counter seats that do not line up to a bar or food service area) may be used for customer seating.
Social distancing, masking, and other mitigation measures must be employed to protect workers and patrons.
Occupancy is limited to 25 percent of stated fire-code maximum occupancy for indoor dining, or 25 persons for a discrete indoor event or gathering in a restaurant. The maximum occupancy limit includes staff.
 Nightclubs must be closed.



Please see FAQs related to the mitigation orders from July 15, 2020.

We’ve largely built testing off our health care system, with all the inequities built into it. That's one of the reasons we're suggesting a call center that’s available to everyone. Even though this virus started in the United States with people returning from cruises or international travel, the populations at greatest risk are low-income, minority communities with high rates of chronic illness and insecure housing and food. The initial attention to people who got coronavirus on cruises and international trips has distracted us from the urgency of providing not just testing but also follow-up services—food, housing, and other supports—for vulnerable populations. It’s the right thing to do as a matter of justice, but it’s also absolutely critical for control of the disease. (Dr. Josh Sharfstein, 4/6/20)
Supplemental resources (4/7/20):
NPR reported on a recent study that shows doctors may be less likely to refer African Americans for testing when they show up for care with signs of infection. The bio-tech data firm Rubix Life Sciences, based in Boston, reviewed recent billing information in several states, and found that an African American with symptoms like cough and fever was less likely to be given one of the scarce coronavirus tests. However, at present, demographic data on coronavirus testing has not been widely disclosed and published. Recently, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Ayanna Pressley have called on the federal Department of Health and Human Services to track racial data and address disparities in the national response to the coronavirus outbreak. In the meantime, cities like Milwaukee and Chicago are tracking COVID-19 data by race, which allows city officials to see and respond to disparities. <SEP> What are the disparities in testing for marginalized communities and how can we address them? <EOS>
Yes, an employer can tell an employee not to come to work. An employer can also require an employee to leave work if they are sick. The employee must still be paid their regular wage for the hours they were at work before the employer sent them home. If employees are asked to stay home, they may apply for unemployment insurance benefits. Employees may also be eligible for paid sick leave under a new federal law – Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA). If an employee is eligible for emergency leave under the FFCRA, an employer may not require an employee to use other paid leave provided by the employer to the employee before the employee uses emergency paid leave under the FFCRA. <SEP> Can an employer require an employee to stay out of work or make them leave work because they are too sick to work? <EOS>

We don’t know for sure which animals can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including dogs and cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19. A tiger at a zoo in New York has also tested positive for the virus.
Recent research shows that ferrets, cats, and golden Syrian hamsters can be experimentally infected with the virus and can spread the infection to other animals of the same species in laboratory settings. Pigs, chickens, and ducks did not become infected or spread the infection based on results from these studies. Data from one study suggested dogs are not as likely to become infected with the virus as cats and ferrets. These findings were based on a small number of animals, and do not show whether animals can spread infection to people.
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by the virus that causes COVID-19 and the role animals may play in the spread of COVID-19. <SEP> What animals can get COVID-19? <EOS>
Emotions and concerns around personal safety can be high.  When it comes to masks, lead through example by following mask guidelines.  You can’t ultimately control other people’s choices. The thing you can do is control yourself and do everything you can to protect yourself.
If you have questions or concerns about the face covering Executive Order, call 877-ASK-VDH3, then choose selection #2.  Do NOT call your local health department.  Do NOT contact law enforcement to address alleged violations.  If you have observed violations of Executive 63 or Executive Order 65 and wish to file a complaint, fill out the report form located here.  Please file only one complaint per incident.
If someone is flouting the rules, appealing to the higher authority of employees and management is an option.  Shaming is never good behavior.  VDH is taking an educational approach by advising the public and businesses of the requirement to wear face coverings.
Law enforcement should only be enforcing secondary violations, such as trespassing, disorderly conduct, inciting a riot, etc.

If your doctor has confirmed that you have COVID-19, or if you are suspected of having COVID-19, isolate yourself from others. Stay at home except when you're going to get medical care. When you go to the doctor, always wear a facemask and avoid using public transportation, ride-sharing, or taxis. While at home, take the following precautions: 

Stay in a separate room from everyone else and use a separate bathroom if possible.
Basic surgical masks help prevent the spread of the virus by stopping the wearer from exposing others to coughing or sneezing. If you are sick, wear a surgical mask when you are around others if possible. 

Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Immediately throw the tissue into a trashcan and wash your hands.

    maintain at least six feet of social distance from everyone else at all times, which may require limiting the number
    of workers or members of the public who are at the site at any time. <SEP> Do the density limitations apply to outdoor facilities or worksites? <EOS>
Patients with COVID-19 who have compromised immune systems should work with their healthcare provider to determine when to end self-isolation. In some cases, severely ill patients with compromised immune systems  experienced prolonged viral shedding after recovery. As such, severely ill patients should consider isolating for 10-20 days.
For more information, please see Discontinuation of Isolation for Persons with COVID -19 Not in Healthcare Settings <SEP> When can people with compromised immune systems who were diagnosed with COVID-19 end self-isolation? <EOS>
Work with local health authorities to communicate the possible exposure to residents, staff, and visitors. Clean and disinfect all shared facilities and high-touch surfaces. Limit visitors to essential staff  and visitors. Staff and, when possible, visitors should be screened for signs and symptoms of COVID-19 before entering the facility. Residents will need to actively monitor their health for COVID-19 symptoms. Cancel group activities. Residences that become ill should be advised to call the medical facility in advance of their visit. See CDC’s full interim guidance for more details. <SEP> What should administrators do if there is a case of COVID-19 in our facility? <EOS>
This is so new that there is no playbook, and what works in one location with one population might not translate easily to another. You should assess and adjust as you experiment with messaging.
Press releases and press conferences alone are probably not going to be as effective as a broad-based communications campaign. What really changes people's behavior is not always hearing from an authority figure. There should be multiple messengers who are credible within the population you are trying to reach. You need people who can translate your message—not just in the literal sense, but also in terms of relatability. Local faith communities and radio stations can help. (Dr. Josh Sharfstein, 4/9/20) <SEP> What makes for an effective public messaging campaign around social distancing? <EOS>
Yes, attending a gathering, ceremony, or celebration is permitted as long as the event complies with the following limits on gatherings.
Indoor gatherings must be limited to 25 people or 25% of a room's capacity -- whichever number is lower. All attendees at indoor gatherings must wear face coverings and stay six feet apart.
The indoor limit on gatherings for weddings, funerals, memorial services, and religious and political activities protected under the First Amendment is 100 people or 25% of a room's capacity -- whichever number is lower.
Outdoor gatherings must be limited to 500 people and social distancing must be practiced. There are no limits for First Amendment-protected outdoor activities, such as political protests of any persuasion or outdoor religious services.
To save lives and stop the spread of COVID-19, wear a mask, wash your hands, practice social distancing, and stay home if you are sick.
Face coverings are required in indoor public spaces and in outdoor public spaces when social distancing is difficult to maintain.
Additional requirements for outdoor gatherings include the following:

Require attendees to be six feet apart at all times, excluding immediate family members, caretakers, household members, or romantic partners;
Prohibit contact between attendees;
If the event is an organized gathering, the organizer should demarcate six feet of spacing in the area of the gathering to demonstrate appropriate spacing for social distancing;
Prohibit sharing of any physical items provided and require sanitization before and after each use; and
Require contactless pay options wherever feasible.

Safety Tips For Gatherings
During this difficult time, we understand everyone wants to spend time with family and friends. To ensure we don't inadvertently spread COVID-19 and needlessly put our loved ones at risk, the NJ Department of Health has offered some safety tips that can help reduce the risk of transmission when we gather in-person.

Remind invited guests to stay home if they have been exposed to the virus in the last 14 days, are showing COVID-19 symptoms, or recently travelled to an area or a state with high COVID-19 infection rates.
Ask guests to wear face coverings when they cannot social distance.
Make hand sanitizer available for guests.
Limit the number of people handling or serving food—for example, consider identifying one person to serve all food so that multiple people are not handling the serving utensils.
Remind guests to wash their hands before serving or eating food.
Use single-use hand towels or paper towels for drying hands so guests do not share a towel.
Clean and disinfect commonly touched surfaces and any shared items between use when feasible.
Consider keeping a list of guests who attended for potential future contract tracing needs. If you are called by a contact tracer, it's critical that you answer the call to protect us all. Your help is the key to stopping the spread of COVID-19 and saving lives.

You can purchase a cloth face covering online from a large corporation (like Amazon) or from independent sellers (like on Etsy). If you’re buying a face mask online, make sure it has at least 2 layers of fabric to be effective against the spread of COVID-19. Many companies and stores are now selling face masks, so you should be able to find them pretty easily. Target and Walmart carry them, for instance. <SEP> Where can I buy a mask? <EOS>
 On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act of 2020 (CARES) passed, including immediate loan assistance for small businesses.

Stimulus loans are not under the purview of the Medicaid program and AHCCCS does not play a role in the administration of small business loan assistance. <SEP>  Is AHCCCS aware of any opportunities for providers to secure loans during the COVID emergency? <EOS>
Kids with autism may need extra support to understand what's going on around them,
               and what's expected of them in some situations.
Social stories are stories that teach kids what happens in some
               situations, and explain what kids should do in those situations. Many social stories
               have pictures to go along with them. Use social stories, pictures, or other visuals
               to help your child know the steps for:

washing hands, wearing a mask, and other ways to stay healthy and safe
staying at least 6 feet away from others who don't live with you
distance learning
new routines at home

Georgia’s State Parks & Historic Sites remain open and need everyone’s help protecting the health of visitors and staff by social distancing and following CDC guidelines. Parks may temporarily limit access if capacity is reached and/or to maintain social distancing among guests. Visiting Georgia’s most well-known state parks is not recommended at this time. We are fortunate to have a large state park system covering more than 84,000 acres, so we recommend exploring lesser-known or close-to-home parks and historic sites.
Additionally:
Trails, boat ramps, fishing docks, and beaches are open.
Campsites, cabins and lodges are open, but some restrooms and bathhouses may be closed.
Historic site museums, grounds and walking trails are open.
Most playgrounds and fitness equipment are open. Splash pads are closed.
Recreational equipment rental such as bikes or mini golf may not be available.
Boat rentals are available at some parks with some limitations and restrictions.
All swimming pools at Georgia State Parks will be closed for the entire summer 2020.
Ranger-led programs are offered at some sites, but most programs require pre-registration.
Golf courses are open; call the club house directly, or book online through each course’s website.
Please visit the State Parks website for additional information. <SEP> Are Georgia State Parks open? <EOS>
Currently we do not know a lot about MIS-C. Any child suspected to have MIS-C should be placed in a private room (if available) on transmission-based precautions.

Yes. A licensee may extend the maturity date of a transaction due to the impact of COVID-19 up to and including June 1, 2020 if the following requirements are met:

The licensee obtains voluntarily written or verbal notification from the customer, which is verifiable in writing or by electronic means, that the customer:
	
Desires to extend the transaction beyond 31 days and
Understands that by keeping this transaction open, their eligibility to obtain additional deferred transactions will be impacted and they may not be eligible to obtain a new transaction until the current transaction is paid; and,


The licensee does not assess, charge, or collect any additional fee from the customer in exchange for extending the transaction beyond 31 days.

A licensee that assesses, charges, or collects any additional fee from a customer in exchange for extending the transaction beyond 31 days may be subject to administrative discipline under the Deferred Presentment Service Transactions Act (DPSTA).1 
 
1 The Veritec database will not allow a licensee to enter a maturity date that is more than 31 days from the transaction date. When extending transactions beyond 31 days, licensees must place an auto-close hold on the transaction and document the new maturity date within their own system or customer records. Please note an auto-close hold cannot be entered prior to the maturity date. Management should generate reports in Veritec of open transactions by due date to identify when auto-close holds can be applied to specific transactions. Licensees must ensure transactions remain open in the Veritec database until the obligations are satisfied. Written notification from the customer may be obtained by email, text or fax. When verbal notification from the customer is obtained, it is highly recommended the licensee record the call. If this is not possible, the licensee must document the verbal request either in the licensee system or the customer file. A single transaction may be extended multiple times as long as the final maturity date does not extend past June 1, 2020 and no additional fees are charged. <SEP> Can a Licensee defer the presentment of a check beyond 31 days during the state of emergency posed by COVID-19? <EOS>
 Each EUA-authorized test has a Letter of Authorization (LOA) and Instructions for Use (or an EUA Summary for tests performed in a single laboratory) available on the EUA page. These documents include FDA requirements regarding ordering the test. For example, there is a condition in the LOAs that the manufacturer comply with 21 CFR 809.10(a)(4), which states that, among other things, the label of an in vitro diagnostic product shall include certain references to: (1) "Rx," (2) a statement regarding the restriction to sale by or on the order of a physician, dentist, veterinarian or (3) with the descriptive designation of any other practitioner licensed by the law of the State in which the practitioner practices to use or order the use of the device. As such, State licensing laws may need to be consulted to determine exactly who can use or order an EUA-authorized COVID-19 test.
Tests offered prior to or without an EUA, under the policies in the Policy for Coronavirus Disease-2019 Tests, are performed in laboratories certified to perform high-complexity testing. Under CLIA regulatory requirements, such laboratories must have a written or electronic request for patient testing from an individual authorized under State law to order tests and/or receive test results. See 42 CFR 493.1241(a); 42 CFR 493.2. State laws should be consulted to see exactly who can order a COVID-19 test and whether the authorized person must be a healthcare provider. <SEP>  Do all COVID-19 tests require a prescription? Do they need to be ordered by a physician? (Updated 5/9) <EOS>
First, try to determine if the patient could be ill with COVID-19. If possible, ask the patient before arrival if they have symptoms of COVID-19 including fever, cough, shortness of breath, chills, muscle aches, new loss of taste or smell, or sore throat.

If the patient has symptoms of COVID-19, he/she should be given a surgical mask to wear, and placed in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR), if possible. If an AIIR is not available, place the patient in an exam room with the door closed. The healthcare provider is strongly encouraged to use full PPE (gloves, gown, N95 mask if available, and eye protection) to see the patient.
If the patient does not have symptoms of COVID-19, proceed with medical care. If possible, provide the services in a private room or an area where there is a 6-foot distance between the patient and other patients. The healthcare provider is advised to wear a surgical mask during the visit.
If possible, ask the patient to avoid sitting in the waiting room. In some settings, patients might opt to wait in a personal vehicle or outside the health care facility where they can be contacted by mobile phone when it is their turn to be evaluated.
Keep a log of personnel who provided care to the patient.
Another consideration would be the use of telemedicine to see the patient. <SEP> What if I need to provide necessary routine medical treatment to someone who has been told to stay home and self-monitor for COVID-19? <EOS>

The Georgia Safety Promise is a statewide campaign from the Governor’s Office and the Georgia Department of Public Health (GDPH) that encourages businesses and the public to agree to simple, but critical, measures that will keep Georgians safe from COVID-19, minimize spread of the virus, and keep Georgia open for business. Making the Georgia Safety Promise means businesses have committed to the latest guidelines from the Governor’s office, including:
Promoting social distancing
Wearing face coverings
Cleaning surfaces
Washing and sanitizing hands <SEP> What is the Georgia Safety Promise? <EOS>

No. While each answer gives us valuable information to stop the spread of COVID-19, you are not required to answer every question. <SEP> Do I have to answer every question? <EOS>
Explain to your child about social distancing and why he/she can't go see their friend. The main reason why there is social distancing is that people with the coronavirus are mostly asymptomatic, which means they have no symptoms and such a person can indirectly spread the virus to anyone. If your child misses their friend, ask them to arrange a Soom meeting or Facetime with their friend so they can feel less lonely. <SEP> What should I do when my child climbed out the window to try and see her friend? <EOS>
Up to 25 percent of people infected with the novel coronavirus may not exhibit symptoms, and could be able to spread COVID-19 to others by breathing or talking. Furthermore, those who are infected and who are coughing or sneezing can spread COVID-19 readily. Because of this, many experts are now advising that we should all wear masks, regardless of how healthy we may be feeling, especially in enclosed spaces like grocery stores. This will help prevent us from unknowingly spreading the disease to others, and provide at least some protection from breathing in virus from others.
There is currently a shortage of manufactured masks like N95 respirator and surgical masks, and these should go to healthcare providers, who are at highest risk of becoming infected, first.
It is very important to learn how to safely put on, wear, and take off masks. To learn how to make your own mask, use it safely, and clean it well, please visit this resource.
According to the CDC, it is also important to take these important steps to reduce your chances of getting sick:


Avoid close contact with people who are sick.


Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.


To the extent possible, avoid touching high-touch surfaces in public places – elevator buttons, door handles, handrails, handshaking with people, etc.

Use a tissue or your sleeve to cover your hand or finger if you must touch something.
Wash your hands after touching surfaces in public places.



Clean AND disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily. This includes tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.


Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.


If soap and water aren't available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.

Cancel all elective and non-urgent procedures and appointments for which a gown is typically used by HCP.
Extended use of isolation gowns.
Re-use of cloth isolation gowns.
Gowns should be prioritized for the following activities:

During care activities where splashes and sprays are anticipated, which typically includes aerosol generating procedures
During the following high-contact patient care activities that provide opportunities for transfer of pathogens to the hands and clothing of healthcare providers, such as dressing, bathing/showering, transferring, providing hygiene, changing linens, changing briefs or assisting with toileting, device care or use, wound care

Fever, dry cough and difficulty breathing are hallmarks of coronavirus. 
Symptoms may appear anywhere from 2 days to 2 weeks after exposure, the CDC says. But some people get no symptoms at all and can infect others without knowing it.
The illness varies in its severity. And while many people can recover at home just fine, some people — including young, previously healthy adults — are suffering long-term symptoms. <SEP> What are the symptoms? <EOS>
That’s really normal. For many people, the coronavirus has offered a strange respite from the pace of the world. Many of us, also, are more introverted than we previously thought. 
Instead of self-flagellating, use this as an opportunity to reset. Politely decline Zoom calls if you’re tired of them. Don’t feel like you need to eat outside with someone until you’re ready. It is a good time to take stock: Who and what is important to me, and who and what do I want in my life after all of this? 
Also, it has never been easier to politely decline plans. Just tell someone you’re wiped out from life right now. Real friends will understand. <SEP> I actually … like … not seeing people. Help? <EOS>
To prevent spread of COVID-19, CDC is recommending individuals employ social distancing or maintaining approximately 6 feet from others, when possible. In food production/processing facilities and retail food establishments, an evaluation should be made to identify and implement operational changes that increase employee separation. However, social distancing to the full 6 feet will not be possible in some food facilities.
The risk of an employee transmitting COVID-19 to another is dependent on distance between employees, the duration of the exposure, and the effectiveness of employee hygiene practices and sanitation. When it’s impractical for employees in these settings to maintain social distancing, effective hygiene practices should be maintained to reduce the chance of spreading the virus. Also, see Should Employees in retail food and food production settings wear face coverings to prevent exposure to COVID-19? (Posted April 4, 2020).
IMPORTANT: Maintaining social distancing in the absence of effective hygiene practices may not prevent the spread of this virus. Food facilities should be vigilant in their hygiene practices, including frequent and proper hand-washing and routine cleaning of all surfaces.
Because the intensity of the COVID-19 outbreak may differ according to geographic location, coordination with state and local officials is strongly encouraged for all businesses so that timely and accurate information can guide appropriate responses in each location where their operations reside.

You are referring to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), two types of medications used primarily to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) and heart disease. Doctors also prescribe these medicines for people who have protein in their urine, a common problem in people with diabetes.At this time, the American Heart Association (AHA), the American College of Cardiology (ACC), and the Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA) strongly recommend that people taking these medications should continue to do so, even if they become infected.Here's how this concern got started. Researchers doing animal studies on a different coronavirus (the SARS coronavirus from the early 2000s) found that certain sites on lung cells called ACE-2 receptors appeared to help the SARS virus enter the lungs and cause pneumonia. ACE inhibitor and ARB drugs raised ACE-2 receptor levels in the animals.Could this mean people taking these drugs are more susceptible to COVID-19 infection and are more likely to get pneumonia?The reality today:
Human studies have not confirmed the findings in animal studies.
Some studies suggest that ACE inhibitors and ARBs may reduce lung injury in people with other viral pneumonias. The same might be true of pneumonia caused by the COVID-19 virus.
Stopping your ACE inhibitor or ARB could actually put you at greater risk of complications from the infection, since it's likely that your blood pressure will rise and heart problems would get worse.
The bottom line: The AHA, ACC, and HFSA strongly recommend continuing to take ACE inhibitor or ARB medications, even if you get sick with COVID-19. <SEP> I heard that certain blood pressure medicines might worsen symptoms of COVID-19. Should I stop taking my medication now just in case I do get infected? Should I stop if I develop symptoms of COVID-19? <EOS>

Temporary Visitation Suspension
As of March 14, the Department of Corrections has temporarily suspended visits. To mitigate the impact of the temporary measure, the Department is increasing access to other forms of communication including:

Expanding inmate and resident access to additional phone calls, free-of-charge.
Expanding inmate and resident access to additional JPay kiosk usage
Providing the inmate and Residential Community Release Program population access to free postage.

Legal visitation is unaffected.
For more information, please refer to this document from the Department of Corrections.
Health Precautions And Testing
In consultation with the Department of Health, the Department of Corrections is taking steps to protect those in custody, employees, and visitors from COVID-19 including:

Conducting health screenings of all individuals entering its facilities
Providing all inmates and residents with face masks
Completing universal baseline testing of staff, inmates, and residents at all Corrections Facilities, Residential Release Programs, and Assessment Centers. For more information about cases and deaths, visit the DOC COVID-19 dashboard.
Inmates with known exposure to COVID-19 are quarantined in a specifically designated quarantine unit within the facility, and the Department is providing alternative housing for its staff who have been exposed to COVID-19.
Limiting foot traffic in facilities, with the implementation of flexible work arrangements for non-essential personnel that includes a reduced and rotational workforce.
Modifying, suspending, or minimizing group activities, dining, recreation, religious gatherings, and education to minimize potential exposure and encourage social distancing. For example, individuals are provided access to religious materials and for the time being are encouraged to practice their faith in their living quarters. Also, educational programs have been adapted in support of independent study.

More information about the steps DOC has taken during this time along with the number of confirmed cases at DOC prisons, halfway houses, and other locations can be found here: https://njdoc.gov/pages/COVID19Updates.shtml
Low-level Offender Release
On April 10, Governor Murphy signed an Executive Order, establishing a process by which the Department of Corrections may grant temporary reprieve to certain at-risk inmates during the public health emergency. This creates the Emergency Medical Review Committee to make recommendations on which inmates should be placed on temporary home confinement through the Commissioner's statutory furlough authority. All recommendations to place an individual on home confinement will be made after thorough review and consideration of the conditions that an individual may face in the community.
The four categories for priority early release include individuals aged 60 years or older; individuals with high risk medical conditions, as determined by DOC in consultation with the Department of Health; individuals whose sentences expire within the next three months; and individuals who were denied parole within the last year. Individuals who have been convicted of a serious offense, including murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, or any offense subject to the No Early Release Act, will be ineligible for temporary reprieve.
On March 22, the New Jersey Supreme Court issued an order to suspend or commute county jail sentences for low-risk inmates. The order commutes or suspends county jail sentences currently being served by county jail inmates either as a condition of probation for an indictable offense or because of a municipal court conviction. At the conclusion of the public health emergency, those released from jail will appear before the court to determine whether their custodial sentences should be reinstated or commuted. No-contact orders, drivers' license suspensions, and other conditions will remain in force.

Some alternatives for persons with hearing loss include using print-outs, a dry-erase board, or pen and paper to communicate; apps like Google LiveTranscribe; or FaceTime/video calls where you ask the doctor to go to their office where they can safely remove their mask and talk with you via videophone, or have them text/email. <SEP>  What about face covers for those who are hearing impaired and rely on reading lips to communicate? <EOS>
If you would like more information about your specific symptoms, please access our Symptom Checker below. Emergency warning signs of severe infection that you should be aware of include significant trouble breathing, persistent pain or pressure in your chest, new confusion or difficulty arousing, or bluish lips or face. If you develop any of these symptoms, or any symptoms you believe are life-threatening, you should call 911 or proceed as soon as possible to the closest ER. If you have less severe symptoms and are unsure about going to the ED, you should contact your medical provider. If you are planning to go to the ER and suspect you may have COVID-19, you should notify the ER immediately on arriving (or the EMS personnel when they arrive at your residence). <SEP> What symptoms would prompt me to go to the ER? <EOS>
CDC and partners are investigating to determine if you can get sick with COVID-19 more than once. At this time, we are not sure if you can become re-infected. Until we know more, continue to take steps to protect yourself and others.
Serology testing, or antibody testing, checks a sample of a person’s blood to look for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. These antibodies are produced when someone has been infected, so a positive result from this test indicates that person was previously infected with the virus. We do not know yet if the antibodies that result from infection with SARS-CoV-2 can protect someone from reinfection with this virus and if they do, how long this protection will last.
At Penn Medicine, antibody testing is available for patients with specific clinical indications. While there is discussion about using these tests to determine who can safely go back to work, this is not yet in practice since we do not know if antibodies confer immunity. We are working to validate commercial antibody tests and make them more widely available. If you have additional questions about whether you are eligible for antibody testing, please contact your regular medical provider.

On January 31, 2020, the U.S. federal government announced that the COVID-19 situation was a Public Health Emergency.
Since then, the federal government has announced a number of quarantine measures, including suspending entry of foreign nationals who have visited one of the following countries in the past 14 days: 

Brazil
China
Iran 
European Schengen area (Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Monaco, San Marino, Vatican City) 
United Kingdom (England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland) 
 Republic of Ireland

In addition, U.S. citizens, residents and their immediate family members who traveled to certain counties are routed to designated airports for health screening upon entry. They are allowed to continue on to their final destination if they do not have any symptoms of illness and will undergo up to 14 days of self-quarantine to ensure they have not contracted the virus.
The federal government is frequently updating its Travel Alerts and may add travelers returning from other countries to the list of who should be monitored. <SEP> 15. What quarantine measures has the federal government put into place? <EOS>
Yes, you can use 91% alcohol if you're careful with your measurements. A hand sanitizer that's 2 parts 91% isopropyl alcohol and 1 part aloe vera will be 60.6% alcohol.

However, if you accidentally get your measurements wrong, your sanitizer may be minimally effective. <SEP> Can I use 91% alcohol instead of 99%? Will it still be effective? <EOS>
Yes. Keep giving all regular asthma
               medicines unless the care team tells you to stop. Keep about 30 days' worth of
               medicine (including for inhalers and nebulizers, if needed) and other needed supplies
               on hand. Work with your insurance
               company and pharmacy or drugstore to order refills well before they run out.
Be sure to:

Make a schedule and stick to it. This is especially helpful for remembering to
               take daily medicines.
Help your child follow their asthma action
               plan.
Keep giving long-term controller medicines
               to help avoid flare-ups. If you aren't sure which they are, call your doctor's office.
               If your child uses an asthma inhaler, be sure
               they're comfortable using it. Get a refresher from the care team, if needed.
Help your child avoid asthma triggers.
               Keep giving allergy medicines, if your child takes them. If pollen
               is a trigger for your child, check air quality before going outside (for instance,
               for exercise at a safe distance from others). If pollen will be high, stick with inside
               activities that day. It's still a good idea for your child to get daily physical activity.
               Besides helping your child to keep fit, it can ease stress,

As explained in the Framework for K-12 Schools in California, school staff should be tested, including teachers, paraprofessionals, cafeteria workers, janitors, bus drivers, or any other school employee that may have contact with students or other staff. School districts and schools should ensure that staff are tested periodically by their primary care provider or by referring teachers to a community testing site, as testing capacity permits and as practicable. Examples of recommended frequency include all staff being tested over 2 months, where 25% of staff are tested every 2 weeks, or 50% every month to rotate which staff members are tested over time. <SEP> Who should be tested and how often? <EOS>
It varies depending on the data source and when the data is reported to the state.
Vital records data is updated periodically after the CDC codes the data. We report out vital records data to account for deaths from COVID-19. 
Epidemiological data, like the number of confirmed cases, is updated daily at 4 p.m. and accounts for all cases reported to the state as of the previous day
Facility outbreak data is updated every Wednesday at 4 p.m.
Please note that the data is only as up-to-date as what has been reported to the state. You may notice lags in data or changes in numbers as labs, hospitals, facilities and local agencies report their data to the state. <SEP> How up-to-date is Colorado’s data? <EOS>

A serologic test is a blood test that looks for antibodies created by your immune system. There are many reasons you might make antibodies, the most important of which is to help fight infections. The serologic test for COVID-19 specifically looks for antibodies against the COVID-19 virus.Your body takes at least five to 10 days after you have acquired the infection to develop antibodies to this virus. For this reason, serologic tests are not sensitive enough to accurately diagnose an active COVID-19 infection, even in people with symptoms.However, serologic tests can help identify anyone who has recovered from coronavirus. This may include people who were not initially identified as having COVID-19 because they had no symptoms, had mild symptoms, chose not to get tested, had a false-negative test, or could not get tested for any reason. Serologic tests will provide a more accurate picture of how many people have been infected with, and recovered from, coronavirus, as well as the true fatality rate.Serologic tests may also provide information about whether people become immune to coronavirus once they've recovered and, if so, how long that immunity lasts. In time, these tests may be used to determine who can safely go back out into the community.Scientists can also study coronavirus antibodies to learn which parts of the coronavirus the immune system responds to, in turn giving them clues about which part of the virus to target in vaccines they are developing.Serological tests are starting to become available and are being developed by many private companies worldwide. However, the accuracy of these tests needs to be validated before widespread use in the US. <SEP> What is serologic (antibody) testing for COVID-19? What can it be used for? <EOS>
Routines are comforting for kids with autism, so do your best to keep as many of

               work, breaks, and exercise.
When possible, help your child take control by giving a couple of choices. For
               example, you could let your child choose what to eat for lunch. When doing school
               work, you can ask what your child would like to do next.
Visual schedules and to-do lists can help kids know what to expect, while timers

To prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 outside of work, HCP should follow CDC’s Guidance on Public Health Recommendations for Community-Related Exposure and the general guidance at Your Health. Because of their potential for exposure to SARS-CoV-2 at work, some HCP may choose to implement extra measures when arriving home from providing healthcare, such as removing any clothing they wore while delivering healthcare, taking off their shoes, washing their clothing, and immediately showering. However, these practices are optional and based on a personal decision; there is insufficient evidence to determine whether these additional practices can lower infection risk.
Because person-to-person transmission through respiratory droplets within a radius of 6 feet is currently thought to be the main way the virus spreads, everyone — including HCP —can reduce the risk to themselves and others by wearing a mask, practicing physical distancing, washing their hands often, and taking other prevention measures.
CDC updates its guidance, including specific guidance in the links above, as additional information becomes available. <SEP> What should healthcare providers (HCP) do outside of work to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19? <EOS>
Our first responders and health care workers are saving lives every day -- so can you.
Your family, your friends, your neighbors -- their lives are literally in your hands.
Here's how you can do your part to protect yourself, your loved ones, and your community:

Get Tested – Testing is now available to everyone in New Jersey. You could have COVID-19 and not even know it. Protect yourself and save the lives of your loved ones by getting tested – especially if you have symptoms, have been in close contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19, are an essential worker, were recently in a large crowd where social distancing was hard to maintain, or recently travelled to an area or a state with high COVID-19 infection rates. Find a testing location near you at covid19.nj.gov/testing
Answer The Phone When A Contact Tracer Calls – You've been called because you either tested positive for COVID-19 or have been in close contact with someone who has – so it's critical you answer the phone. Contact tracers are calling with life-saving information that will keep you, your loved ones, and your community safe and healthy. Learn how contact tracing saves lives at covid19.nj.gov/testandtrace
Wear a Mask - Always wear a mask over your nose and mouth in public spaces, and anywhere that you cannot keep 6 feet of distance from another person. Face coverings are required in indoor public spaces and in outdoor public spaces when social distancing is difficult to maintain.
Keep a Social Distance - Keep six feet between yourself and others whenever possible and avoid crowded areas.

Know How COVID-19 Spreads
There is currently no vaccine to prevent COVID-19. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus.
The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet) and through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
Some recent studies have suggested that COVID-19 may be spread by people who are not showing symptoms.
Steps To Protect Yourself And Others

Stay home if you are sick, except to get medical care. Learn what to do if you are sick.
Face coverings are required in indoor public spaces and in outdoor public spaces when social distancing is difficult to maintain.
Keep six feet between yourself and others whenever possible and avoid crowded areas.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.
If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces. For more, see the CDC's guidelines on how to properly clean and disinfect.
Avoid close contact with people who are sick.

Visit the CDC site to learn more about how to protect yourself.
Safety Tips For Gatherings
During this difficult time, we understand everyone wants to spend time with family and friends. To ensure we don't inadvertently spread COVID-19 and needlessly put our loved ones at risk, the NJ Department of Health has offered some safety tips that can help reduce the risk of transmission when we gather in-person.

Remind invited guests to stay home if they have been exposed to the virus in the last 14 days, are showing COVID-19 symptoms, or recently travelled to an area or a state with high COVID-19 infection rates.
Ask guests to wear face coverings when they cannot social distance.
Make hand sanitizer available for guests.
Limit the number of people handling or serving food—for example, consider identifying one person to serve all food so that multiple people are not handling the serving utensils.
Remind guests to wash their hands before serving or eating food.
Use single-use hand towels or paper towels for drying hands so guests do not share a towel.
Clean and disinfect commonly touched surfaces and any shared items between use when feasible.
Consider keeping a list of guests who attended for potential future contract tracing needs. If you are called by a contact tracer, it's critical that you answer the call to protect us all. Your help is the key to stopping the spread of COVID-19 and saving lives.

Managing Your Risk
The NJ Department of Health breaks down the spread of COVID-19 into four factors:

TIME: How long will you be in a place? More time sitting in one place means higher risk.
SPACE: How much space will be around you? Less space means higher risk.
PEOPLE: How many people will be around you? More people means higher risk.
PLACE: What type of place are you going to? Indoor spaces mean higher risk.

Keeping these factors in mind can help you assess your risk while participating in activities.

 During the State of Emergency declared by the Governor pursuant to  Executive Order 202 relating to the COVID-19 health emergency, face to face  supervision may be provided using distance technology. The supervisor remains responsible for the  professional services being provided by the supervisee and must ensure that all  aspects of a supervisee’s practice receive proper oversight, not just what is  reported in a supervisory session. If supervision takes place across state  lines, the supervisor must be licensed in both the jurisdiction where he/she is  physically located and the jurisdiction where the services are provided.

While a fever is a common symptom of having a COVID-19 infection, this isn't always the case. Research on those who have had the virus in China show that people experienced a fever in 88% of cases, leaving 12% of those with the infection not experiencing a fever.

Using a fabric mask:Clean your hands before putting on the mask. Inspect the mask for tears or holes, do not use a mask that is damaged.Adjust the mask to cover your mouth, nose, and chin, leaving no gaps on the sides.Avoid touching the mask while wearing it.Change your mask if it gets dirty or wet.Clean your hands before taking off the mask.Take off the mask by removing it from the ear loops, without touching the front of the mask.Clean your hands after removing the mask.Caring for a fabric mask:If your fabric mask is not dirty or wet and you plan to reuse it, put it in a clean plastic, resealable bag. If you need to use it again, hold the mask at the elastic loops when removing it from the bag.Wash fabric masks in soap or detergent and preferably hot water (at least 60 degrees) at least once a day.If hot water is not available, wash the mask in soap/detergent and room-temperature water, followed by either boiling the mask for 1 minute OR; by soaking the mask in 0.1% chlorine for 1 minute and thoroughly rinsing the mask with room temperature water (there should not be any toxic residue of chlorine on the mask).Make sure you have your own mask and do not share it with others. When and how to use masksRemember, the use of a fabric mask alone is not sufficient to provide an adequate level of protection. Maintain a minimum physical distance of at least 1 metre from others and frequently clean your hands. <SEP> How should I wear and care for a fabric mask? <EOS>
New COVID-19 cases and number of deaths are recorded based on data collected and reported by state, local, and territorial health departments. This information can be affected by local testing practices, laboratory capacity, and medical resources. Comparing the COVID-19 situation among jurisdictions should not be based on these rates alone.
When studying the COVID-19 situation in jurisdictions, the rate of new COVID-19 cases should be combined with other data, including number of tests performed, test positivity, testing policies, excess mortality, and rates of hospital and ICU admissions.
In addition, jurisdictions vary in the completeness of certain demographic data for COVID-19 cases. Most states have demographic factors like age and sex for the majority of reported cases. However, in many states, the large number of COVID-19 cases has severely strained the ability to report cases with complete demographic information for race and ethnicity. With thousands of cases being reported, completeness of these elements is unlikely to improve in the immediate future for some jurisdictions. Because the racial and ethnic composition of the population varies by geographic area, comparisons of COVID-19 case information should consider the population of each geographic area. In addition, because completeness of race and ethnicity information may vary by state or geographic area and by other patient factors, such as severity, case data at CDC may not be generalizable to the entire U.S. population. <SEP> What are the limitations in using case surveillance data to compare jurisdictions or analyze demographic trends? <EOS>
No. The COVID-19  crisis is not over. There is no vaccine or cure for COVID-19 yet.
Stay home. Even if you feel well and have no symptoms,  you should stay home as much as you can.
New Yorkers working together and  staying home can help slow the spread of COVID-19. When you go out for  essential needs, essential work or to get fresh air, wear a face covering, keep  at least 6 feet of distance between yourself and others and take the following  precautions.
Wash your  hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based  hand sanitizer with 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available. 
Do not touch  your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
Do not shake  hands. Instead, wave.
Monitor your  heath more closely than usual for fever, cough, difficulty breathing, sore  throat and other symptoms. <SEP> Does that mean that I do not need to worry about COVID-19 anymore? <EOS>
Yes. If a reusable smock or cape can be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected after each client, it can be used instead
    of a fabric smock or cape that is laundered after each client. But businesses cannot reuse smocks or capes that are
    simply spot-cleaned or wiped down after each client.
Please note that on July 13, the State Health Officer ordered the closure of all indoor operations at personal
        care services businesses, hair salons, and barbershops in Santa Clara County. This means these
            businesses may only operate outdoors at this time. All outdoor operations are subject to the
        Health Officer’s Mandatory Directive for Personal Care Services Businesses and any applicable safety- and
        health-related regulatory requirements. <SEP> The Personal Care Services Directive requires businesses to dispose of or “launder” smocks or capes after

If you were around someone who has been diagnosed with COVID-19, someone from the health department may call you to let you know that you may have been exposed to COVID-19.
Stay home away from others for 14 days (self-quarantine) after your last contact with that person. Health department staff will help identify the dates for your self-quarantine. Health department staff can also provide resources for COVID-19 testing in your area.

Self-quarantine means staying home away from others and monitoring your health.
If you need to be around other people or animals in or outside of the home, wear a mask. This will help protect the people around you.
If you need support or assistance while in self-quarantine, your health department or community organizations may be able to provide assistance.

Monitor your health and watch for symptoms of COVID-19. Remember, symptoms may appear 2-14 days after you were exposed to COVID-19. Tell the health department if you develop any symptoms. Tell people you were around recently if you become ill, so they can monitor their health. If your symptoms worsen or become severe, seek medical care. Severe symptoms include trouble breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, new confusion, inability to wake or stay awake, or bluish lips or face.

There is no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 is transmitted by food, including fresh fruits and vegetables. The virus can be killed while cooking food at temperatures of at least 70°C.Food buffets are not recommended because of the risk of close physical contact with others, shared serving implements and multiple people touching the surfaces on the buffet. Indoor dining spaces should have a maximum of 4 people in 10 square metres. The distance from the back of one chair to the back of another chair should be at least 1 metre apart for both indoor and outdoor dining, and guests that face each other should also be at this distance.Guests should be reminded when entering and leaving the area to clean their hands. When the physical distance of at least 1 metre cannot be guaranteed, masks are recommended to be worn by staff and guests. More on masks, including who should wear what kind and when, is available here. <SEP> Are there precautions to take while eating in a restaurant? <EOS>
There is an overlap between symptoms of COVID-19 and the flu, common cold, or allergies. It may be difficult to distinguish based on symptoms alone. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, dry cough, and fatigue. Other symptoms include shortness of breath which can range from mild to severe, generalized muscle aches and sore throat. Diarrhea, nausea, runny nose, and red eyes are reported but less common.  These symptoms can also be seen with the flu or other respiratory viruses, but those viruses have largely receded at this time. Seasonal allergies rarely cause a fever and severe shortness of breath. The only definite way to know whether you have COVID-19 or influenza is to be tested by a healthcare provider. You can further discuss your symptoms with your provider to determine if you meet the criteria for testing. <SEP> How is coronavirus different from flu? <EOS>
If a guest at the accommodation develops symptoms of COVID-19, such as fever, dry cough or tiredness, staff at the accommodation establishment should contact the local health authority and follow their instructions. The sick person should be isolated in a room, alone, or at least 1 metre away from others, according to local health authorities’ instructions. No visitors should be permitted to enter the room occupied by the affected guest. Staff should also move people traveling with the sick person to a different room, if possible. It is usually the relevant public health authority, not the management of the hotel and accommodation establishment, which has the authority to demand sick guests to temporarily remain in their room or to prevent them from receiving visits from other guests. National law will guide the rights of the guests to refuse or not the recommended measures.Staff entering the room of an ill person should maintain at least a 1 metre distance from the ill person, and request that the ill person put on a medical mask.  If staff need to assist an ill guest within a 1 metre distance, they should clean their hands before putting on appropriate personal protective equipment (medical mask and eye protection, gloves and isolation gown), and clean their hands after providing assistance. Training should be provided on how to avoid contaminating themselves. <SEP> What should staff do if a guest becomes sick at an accommodation establishment? <EOS>
EFMLA has different eligibility criteria than FMLA. An employee is eligible for EFMLA leave if they have worked for any executive branch agency, including MSRS, PERA, TRA or Minnesota State, for at least 30 calendar days prior to the start of their leave, even though they may not be eligible for FMLA leave.

A recent study found that the COVID-19 coronavirus can survive up to four hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard, and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel. The researchers also found that this virus can hang out as droplets in the air for up to three hours before they fall. But most often they will fall more quickly.There's a lot we still don't know, such as how different conditions, such as exposure to sunlight, heat, or cold, can affect these survival times.As we learn more, continue to follow the CDC's recommendations for cleaning frequently touched surfaces and objects every day. These include counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables.If surfaces are dirty, first clean them using a detergent and water, then disinfect them. A list of products suitable for use against COVID-19 is available here. This list has been pre-approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for use during the COVID-19 outbreak.In addition, wash your hands for 20 seconds with soap and water after bringing in packages, or after trips to the grocery store or other places where you may have come into contact with infected surfaces. <SEP> How long can the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 survive on surfaces? <EOS>

 If you develop any of these emergency warning signs for the disease, you should seek medical attention immediately: 
Trouble breathing
Persistent pain or pressure in the chest
New confusion or inability to arouse
Bluish lips or face
 This list is not all inclusive. Please consult your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you.Call 911 if you have a medical emergency.

Always wear a mask over your nose and mouth in public spaces. Even if you don't feel sick, germs can spread to others through respiratory droplets produced by breathing, talking, sneezing, and coughing.
In New Jersey, individuals must wear face coverings:

in outdoor public spaces when social distancing is not possible;
in indoor spaces open to the public, including retail, recreational, and entertainment businesses, government buildings open to the public, and on public transportation; and
in indoor commercial spaces closed to the public, including office buildings, when individuals are in prolonged proximity to others.

There are exceptions for children under two years old, for eating and drinking at outdoor dining establishments, when individuals need to briefly remove face coverings for religious reasons, and when wearing a mask would endanger one's health, including when engaging high intensity aerobic/anaerobic activities and when in water. The outdoor face covering requirement does not apply to child care centers, other center care facilities, and youth summer camps, which must follow their own specific guidance.
How Face Coverings Save Lives
COVID-19 spreads mainly among people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet), so the use of cloth face coverings is particularly important in settings where people are close to each other or where social distancing is difficult to maintain.
Wearing a face covering or mask has been shown to dramatically decrease the release of droplets from people's mouths, which can carry infectious particles. Studies have demonstrated that masks are an important barrier to transmission of respiratory viruses.
Wearing a simple cloth face covering is not a replacement for social distancing. Keep six feet between yourself and others whenever possible and avoid crowded areas. Face coverings, social distancing, staying home when you're sick, and good hand hygiene are all vital tools in the fight against COVID-19.
Cloth Face Coverings vs Surgical Masks
The cloth face coverings recommended are not surgical masks. They are not medical grade N-95 respirators. Those are critical supplies that must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other first responders who are caring for the sick. If you have these products in your home, we ask that you donate them to the COVID-19 effort through this website.
Cloth face coverings can be made at home from common materials like scarves or bandanas. A simple cloth face covering should cover the nose and mouth.
Cloth face coverings are not recommended for children under 2 years, people who are incapacitated, people who have difficulty breathing, or any other person who cannot easily remove their own mask.
How To Wear A Face Covering or Mask Correctly

Make sure you can breathe through it
Your nose and mouth should be covered
Face coverings should not be placed on children under 2 years old or people who have trouble breathing

Maintain Healthy Habits

Wash the face covering after use
Avoid contact with sick people
Wash hands often with soap and water; use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol if soap and water aren't available

Keep Social Distancing

Face coverings/masks do not replace social distancing
You may be sick (carrying germs) and not even know
Face coverings + social distancing = less community spread of disease

Please visit this CDC page for more information on how to appropriately wear a face mask, how to use homemade cloth coverings, and for instructions on making a face mask at home.

Take time now to make plans and prepare your pets in case you can no longer take care of your pets or have to go to the hospital due to COVID-19.

Designate a trusted pet caregiver (family, friend, neighbor, colleague), who has a set of keys to your home, is familiar with your home and pet, knows your emergency plan, and has your contact information.
Prepare pet care instruction documents for each of your pets with information on feeding, watering, health conditions, medications, etc.
Make sure your pet is microchipped, the microchip is registered, and information is up to date. Your pet should always be wearing a collar or harness with identification.
Make sure your pet’s veterinary care and vaccines are up to date. Organize your veterinary records so they are readily accessible.
In addition to making sure you have a supply of your own medication, be certain you have at least 2-4 weeks of your pet’s medication.
Ensure you have an adequate supply of pet food, litter, and other consumable supplies.
Have leashes and crates/carriers available in case your pets need to be transported. <SEP> How should I prepare for COVID-19 if I have a pet? <EOS>
Treatment is similar for that of the flu - rest and fluids.  There are currently no antiviral drugs recommended or licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for COVID-19 for children or adults.  Children and their family members should try to prevent the spread of infection by covering coughs, cleaning hands often with soap and water or 60% alcohol-based hand sanitizer, and staying up to date on vaccinations, including influenza. <SEP> Are there any treatments available for children with COVID-19? <EOS>
When an employee does not claim a legitimate exemption from face covering requirements (for example, due to a disability) but still refuses to wear a face covering, businesses should take appropriate disciplinary action. 
If a customer who does not claim a legitimate exemption refuses to comply with face covering requirements, businesses should assess the situation and determine how best to proceed, using normal procedures for dealing with a difficult customer. Because businesses have an obligation to protect their workers from hazards—including COVID-19 infection—businesses must take steps to mitigate or eliminate the risks posed by a person who refuses to wear a face covering. 
Here are some best practices to consider:

If a customer (or visitor) enters or attempts to enter without a face covering, communicate face covering requirements to the customer, offer the customer a face covering, and request that they put it on.
If a customer continues to refuse to wear a face covering, decline services to the customer, or request that the customer not enter the premises or leave the premises. 
The business may also offer the customer service alternatives, if available, including curbside pick-up, home delivery, or retrieving merchandise for the customer. 
Based on its assessment of the situation, the business may also determine that there is a need to engage law enforcement to assist. 

Nothing in the Executive Order provides businesses with the right to physically restrain or remove a noncompliant person when it would not otherwise be legal to do so. Employees and management should avoid direct enforcement in situations that would put themselves or others at risk of harm and instead consider engaging law enforcement. <SEP> What should a business do when customers or workers refuse to comply with face covering requirements? <EOS>
Stay at home for 2 weeks, just in case you’ve contracted the virus from another person.

 As of March 23, AHCCCS has received federal approval to implement programmatic changes, including the suspension of Pre-Admission Screening and Annual Resident Review (PASRR) Level I and Level II Assessments.  Effective March 23, 2020, AHCCCS will not forward any Level II PASRR to the RBHA Contractor for evaluation completion. All PASRR Level II requests forwarded to the RBHA Contractor after March 23, 2020 are now considered cancelled and do not need to be completed by the practitioner. The AHCCCS PASRR team will outreach to the appropriate Nursing Facilities and hospitals to make staff and patients aware of cancelled PASRR Level II evaluations. Any PASRR evaluations forwarded to the RBHA Contractor prior to March 23, 2020 should be completed within the mandated timeframes and returned to the PASRR program mailbox. PASRR invoices will be processed for all completed Level II evaluations.  AHCCCS will inform the contractor when PASRR operations will resume.

Removal of long acting methods such as implants or IUDs, after the recommended period of use (and routine follow up appointments) may not be prioritized by your country’s health system during this health emergency. Seek advice from your health provider. If you are experiencing side effects or desire urgent removal for other reasons, contact a provider to find out what options suit you best, and which are available and feasible. If, due to restrictions on movement due to the COVID-19 pandemic you cannot have your long acting method removed straight away, it is important to use another method of contraception to avoid pregnancy at this time.   There are no medical problems caused by delaying removal of long acting methods such as implants or IUDs. Do not try to remove the contraception method yourself; wait until you are able to access health care from a trained provider. <SEP> I want to remove or replace my implant or IUD – can I do this during COVID-19 pandemic? <EOS>
There is currently no scientific evidence to show that taking ibuprofen while sick with COVID-19 will lead to worsening illness.

This is not a good time to be vaping or smoking anything, including weed. 
“Vaping affects your lungs at every level. It affects the immune function in your nasal cavity by affecting cilia, which push foreign things out,” said Prof. Stanton Glantz, director of the Center for Tobacco Research Control and Education at University of California San Francisco.
When you vape, “the ability of your upper airways to clear viruses is compromised,” Glantz said.
Tobacco smokers are at especially high risk. In a study from China, where the first Covid-19 outbreak occurred, smokers were 14 times more likely to develop severe complications than non-smokers.
Even occasionally smoking marijuana can put you at greater risk.
“What happens to your airways when you smoke cannabis is that it causes some degree of inflammation, very similar to bronchitis, very similar to the type of inflammation that cigarette smoking can cause,” said pulmonologist Dr. Albert Rizzo, chief medical officer for the American Lung Association.
“Now you have some airway inflammation, and you get an infection on top of it. So yes, your chance of getting more complications is there.” <SEP> Are smokers or vapers at higher risk? What if I only smoke weed? <EOS>

Yes. COVID-19 may live on surfaces for different lengths of time. We all touch certain things frequently: doorknobs, light switches, faucets, countertops, and more. If you touch something that was just touched by someone with the virus on their hands, you could pick up the virus on yours.

FDA-regulated food manufacturers are required to follow Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMPs) and many have food safety plans that include a hazards analysis and risk-based preventive controls. CGMPs and food safety plans have requirements for maintaining clean and sanitized facilities and food contact surfaces. See: FSMA Final Rule for Preventive Controls for Human Food.

Food facilities are required to use EPA-registered “sanitizer” products in their cleaning and sanitizing practices.


In addition, there is a list of EPA-registered “disinfectant” products for COVID-19 on the Disinfectants for Use Against SARS-CoV-2 list that have qualified under EPA’s emerging viral pathogen program for use against SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.


IMPORTANT: Check the product label guidelines for if and where these disinfectant products are safe and recommended for use in food manufacturing areas or food establishments.


We encourage coordination with localExternal Link Disclaimer health officials for all businesses so that timely and accurate information can guide appropriate responses in each location where their operations reside.

For each risk assessment, consider the environment, the task, the threat, resources available, such as personal protective equipment, and the feasibility of protective measures. The risk assessment should also extend to collective accommodation provided by the employer for workers, such as dormitories.  Essential public services, such as security and police, food retail, accommodation, public transport, deliveries, water and sanitation, and other frontline workers may be at an increased risk of exposure to occupational hazards for health and safety.

Every test has a particular false-negative rate, and sometimes a false-positive rate, and results may differ when tests are taken on different days. When people are just getting sick, false negatives are not uncommon. If someone has symptoms and test results are inconclusive, physicians should treat the person like they're positive. Sometimes, when there's enough of a story—e.g., someone says, "I've lost my sense of smell. I'm coughing”—even if the test is negative, you treat it like a case.
Tests have strengths and weaknesses. Short answer: when results conflict, assume the patient has coronavirus. (Dr. Josh Sharfstein, 5/19/20)
Contact tracing is the tool to get us out of this crisis safely. We should be putting as much energy as possible into scaling those capabilities. Communities are saying this is new for them; they're not sure how this works, but contact tracing is something we do all the time in public health—for sexually transmitted infections, pertussis, and measles. It's really about scaling those capabilities, supporting people as they undergo isolation and quarantine and helping to keep our communities safe.

COVID-19 testing and treatment is available to everyone in New Jersey regardless of their insurance or immigration status.
Below you will find resources for free testing and treatment as well as how to apply for health insurance.
COVID-19 TESTING AND TREATMENT
Community Health Centers, also known as Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), provide free health care and COVID-19 testing whether you have insurance or not and regardless of your immigration status.
Find an FQHC near you with this search tool, through 211 online, or by directly calling 2-1-1 (support is available in English and Spanish).
Immigration officials have confirmed that testing, treatment, and preventative care related to COVID-19 will not negatively affect your public charge analysis.
Individuals with urgent symptoms may also continue to access services at acute care hospitals. The COVID-19 testing cost will be waived for uninsured individuals eligible for charity care. Information on the Charity Care Program can be found at: https://www.nj.gov/health/charitycare. You should talk to a medical provider before going to your local hospital.
HEALTH INSURANCE
If you do not have health insurance or lose coverage, you may be eligible for free or low-cost coverage (www.njfamilycare.org) through NJ FamilyCare, New Jersey's publicly funded health insurance program. NJ Family Care includes CHIP, Medicaid and Medicaid expansion populations and covers doctor visits, prescriptions, vision, dental care, mental health and substance use services and even hospitalization.
If you have experienced a life-changing event, such as losing job-based health coverage, you may qualify for a Special Enrollment Period that would allow you to presently enroll in health coverage. If you or anyone in your household lost qualifying health coverage in the past 60 days OR expects to lose coverage in the next 60 days, you may qualify for a Special Enrollment Period.
Visit GetCoveredNJ (www.getcovered.nj.gov) to see if you qualify or go directly to www.healthcare.gov to enroll in coverage.
Trained professionals are available to help with enrollment. You can reach a trained navigator by phone, by calling the Center for Family Services Statewide Navigator Enrollment Hotline at 1-877-9-NAVIG8 (1-877-962-8448).
Note: State and federal law also require that most employees and dependents who lose health coverage under an employer's group health plan be given the opportunity to continue coverage for a period of time. Under the federal law (COBRA) and state law, the person electing to continue coverage can be required to pay the full premium plus a 2% administrative fee. You can contact your employer or benefits administrator for more information.
Does NJ FamilyCare cover costs associated with COVID-19?
NJ FamilyCare, the State's publicly funded health insurance program, covers testing, visits for testing, and testing-related services without cost to members. The program will also cover 90-day supplies of prescriptions for maintenance medications and early refills of prescriptions.
Additionally, New Jersey has taken administrative actionto waive consumer cost sharing for all medically necessary COVID-19 testing, as well as services related to testing. The waiving of consumer cost sharing applies to the State's individual, small, and large group markets; the State Health Benefits and School Employee Health Benefits Plans; NJ FamilyCare's CHIP population; and the state's uninsured population, eligible for the Charity Care program.
How do I apply for NJ FamilyCare?
If you have experienced a life-changing event, such as losing your job or health coverage, you may qualify for a Special Enrollment Period that would allow you to presently enroll in health coverage.

To keep your employees safe, you should:

Consider options to increase physical space between employees and customers such as opening a drive- through, erecting partitions, and marking floors to guide spacing at least 6 feet apart.
At least once a day, clean and disinfect surfaces that are frequently touched by multiple people. This includes door handles, desks, phones, light switches, and faucets.
Consider assigning a person to rotate throughout the workplace to clean and disinfect surfaces.
Consider scheduling handwashing breaks so employees can wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
Consider scheduling a relief person to give cashiers and service desk employees an opportunity to wash their hands.
Additional information on how to keep employees safe can be found in the CDC Guidance for Businesses and Employers. <SEP> How do I keep employees who interact with customers safe? <EOS>
To protect yourself and your family:

Avoid large crowds and busy places.
Stay at least 6 feet
               from people you don't live with. COVID-19 can spread before a person has symptoms
               and even when someone has no symptoms.
When you go out, adults and kids over 2 years old should wear
               a mask or cloth face covering to help slow the spread of the virus. To see how
               to put on and remove masks, clean them, or
               make your own cloth mask, check the CDC's
               guide.
Wash your hands well and often.
               Wash for at least 20 seconds with soap and water or use hand sanitizer with at least
               60% alcohol. Teach your kids to do the same.
Try not to touch your eyes, nose, or mouth.
Use a household cleaner or wipe to clean and disinfect surfaces and objects that
               people touch a lot.
Keep informed about the spread of coronavirus in your community. You can find
               this on your local department of health website.
Follow recommendations from your local health authority, especially if there are
               a lot of people with coronavirus in your area.
Make sure your children have all their vaccinations.
               Protect them against illnesses like measles
               and the flu. Kids who have another infection may
               have a harder time getting better if they do get COVID-19.

Experts around the world are studying and tracking COVID-19 and are learning how

Physical activity includes all forms of active
recreation, sports participation, cycling and walking, as well as activities
you do at work and around the home and garden. It doesn’t have to be exercise
or sport – play, dance, gardening, and even house cleaning and carrying heavy
shopping is all part of being physically active.During the COVID-19 pandemic, when so many of us are
very restricted in our movements, it is even more important for people of all
ages and abilities to be as active as possible. Even a short break from
sitting, by doing 3-5 minutes of physical movement, such as walking or
stretching, will help ease muscle strain, relieve mental tension and improve
blood circulation and muscle activity. Regular physical activity can also help
to give the day a routine and be a way of staying in contact with family and
friends. <SEP> What is physical activity? <EOS>
Employees have the responsibility to inform themselves by consulting information provided by health authorities and by their employer, such as 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19): Outbreak update. They are responsible for following their management's directions regarding reporting to work and workplace health procedures in the context of the COVID-19.
Section 126 of the Canada Labour Code outlines reasonable expectations for all employees regardless of their position in the organization. Employees' duties include, among others:

Using safety equipment provided to them;
Complying with all instructions from the employer concerning the health and safety of employees; and
Cooperating with any person carrying out a duty set out in the Code.

While at work, employees must also report to the employer any object, situation or circumstance in a workplace that is likely to be hazardous to the health or safety of employees or other persons granted access to the workplace by the employer.
To avoid spreading the virus to colleagues and clients, employees who have symptoms of COVID-19 (fever, cough, and difficulty breathing) have a duty to stay at home as long as they present symptoms or as long as directed by their doctors. <SEP> As an personnel member, what are my responsibilities in the context of COVID-19? <EOS>
This is unknown at this time.  Currently, there is no safe and effective vaccine available.  Also, it’s not clear if previous infection with the virus that causes COVID-19 leads to long-lasting immunity. <SEP> Can we attain herd immunity with COVID-19? <EOS>
 It will depend on the type of mask you want to manufacture.Masks for non-medical purposes are not medical devices and are not regulated by the FDA.The FDA has issued an EUA for face masks that meet certain criteria, including cloth face coverings recommended by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). During the COVID-19 public health emergency, a face mask for a medical purpose that is intended for use as source control, is not labeled as a surgical mask, and is not intended to provide liquid barrier protection, may be authorized under the "umbrella" EUA for face masks without submitting documentation to the FDA if the face mask meets the eligibility requirements. A face mask authorized under this EUA must comply with the Conditions of Authorization (Section IV) of the EUA. Please note that this EUA does not authorize face masks for use as personal protective equipment.In addition to the "umbrella" EUA for Face Masks, as described in the FDA’s policy on face masks and surgical masks that is in effect during the COVID-19 public health emergency, the FDA does not expect manufacturers of face masks for a medical purpose that are not intended to provide liquid barrier protection to submit notification to the FDA before they begin marketing their product, or to comply with certain regulatory requirements, where the face mask does not create an undue risk in light of the public health emergency.Under the policy, the FDA believes face masks not intended to provide liquid barrier protection do not create such an undue risk where:The face masks include labeling that:, Accurately describes the product as a face mask (as opposed to a surgical mask or filtering facepiece respirator);, , Includes a list of body-contacting materials (which does not include any drugs or biologics); and, , Includes recommendations and general statements that would reduce the risk of use. For example, recommendations against use:, In any surgical setting or where significant exposure to liquid, bodily, or other hazardous fluids may be expected;, , In a clinical setting where the infection risks level through inhalation exposure is high;, , In the presence of a high intensity heat source or flammable gas;, , , , The face masks are not intended for any use that would create such an undue risk. For example, the labeling does not include uses for antimicrobial or antiviral protection, infection prevention or reduction, or related uses, and does not include particulate filtration claims., <SEP>  I am interested in manufacturing face masks for COVID-19. What do I need to do? <EOS>
You may notice coughing, a sore throat, a runny or stuffy nose, body aches, tiredness, chills or a fever, trouble breathing, inability to smell or taste, diarrhea, vomiting, and nausea. Reports show that tiredness, body aches, and headaches are the most common symptoms of COVID-19, while other fairly common symptoms are diarrhea, vomiting, and nausea. 
Certain groups of people, like younger patients and females, are more likely to lose their sense of smell and taste. These symptoms typically show up before more common respiratory issues. <SEP> What are the early signs and symptoms of COVID-19? <EOS>

Employers do not need to purchase masks from any specific vendor, but are required to provide masks to employees to wear during business hours. Homemade masks and masks owned by employees are allowable. The Department of Health has published guidance on how to make cloth masks. Additionally, the Department of Community and Economic Development has created a Business-2-Business Directory, which identifies potential vendors of masks and other Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), available here. <SEP> Are there recommendations on where employers can purchase masks for employees? <EOS>
Before the State issued its July 13 order, the following businesses and activities were already closed statewide:

Public events and gatherings, like conferences and live audience sports 
Convention centers
Theme parks and festivals
In-person higher education (except to support critical sector activities)
Indoor playgrounds, like bounce centers, ball pits, and laser tag
Saunas and steam rooms
Recreational team sports

All of these businesses and activities remain closed. <SEP> What was already closed statewide? <EOS>
Interviewers ask questions about your COVID-19 illness, your exposure to COVID-19, and people you have been in close contact with. They will also give you information to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 to others. <SEP> What other questions will contact tracers ask? <EOS>
No, not necessarily. COVID-19 is still circulating in our community. Gathering together with people from other
    households, especially indoors, is still risky. Individuals over the age of 70 and individuals with medical
    conditions should not participate in gatherings. Indoor gatherings are particularly risky and are not allowed at
    this time. <SEP> Are gatherings safe now? <EOS>
It is known that children are able to transmit infection to others, but the transmission dynamics and primary routes of transmission remain unclear.
When schools close for extended periods, children and young people are deprived of opportunities for growth and development. These disadvantages are disproportionate for under-privileged learners who tend to have fewer educational opportunities outside of school.
Research has highlighted the active social life that children aged 2-10 years have at school. This helps them to learn from their peers and has a positive impact on personality traits and their sense of identity. Disruptions to close peer relationships have been associated with depression, guilt, and anger in children.
Furthermore, school and extracurricular activities are among the activities that provide structure, meaning and a daily rhythm for children. For those suffering from anxiety and depression, the loss of such activities can worsen symptoms and further reinforce social withdrawal and hopelessness.
Therefore, children should be allowed to interact in order to reduce the risks outlined above, if possible with adherence to specific measures such as increased physical distancing, improved ventilation, regular hand-washing and the use of masks when feasible. <SEP> 8. Should children play together? <EOS>
The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM)external icon has developed standards for patient examination gloves.

Stay up to date on the latest evidence about the risk for patients with underlying medical conditions. CDC analyzes data to determine the level of risk for people with underlying medical conditions and will provide updates over time as new information is available.
You know your patients’ overall health and how well their conditions are managed. Use your clinical judgment to evaluate each patient’s level of risk.
Help patients manage their underlying conditions to the best of their ability, encouraging them to take medicines as prescribed and ensuring that patients have sufficient medication and supplies. For example, you may prescribe 3-month supplies of medications to ensure they have access to sufficient medications.
Explain to all patients which symptoms of their chronic conditions require emergency care or in-person visits. Stress the importance of obtaining emergency care if needed.
Reassure your patients who require emergency care that emergency departments (ED) have infection prevention plans to protect them from acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection in the ED.
Tell patients with underlying medical conditions that increase their risk of severe illness or poorer outcomes from COVID-19 to:

Take precautions to reduce the risk of getting COVID-19.
Closely follow your care plans for managing their chronic disease, including, for example, achieving better glycemic or blood pressure control.
Seek emergency care if any of their underlying medical conditions worsen and require immediate attention.


Encourage all patients, regardless of risk, to:

Take steps to protect themselves.
Call their healthcare provider if you are sick with a fever, cough, or shortness of breath.
Follow CDC travel guidelines and the recommendations of your state and local health officials.


Fear and anxiety about a new disease can feel overwhelming, especially for those with underlying risk factors, those in close contact with infected patients, and those with sources of stress outside the workplace. Follow guidance on ways to take care of yourself and encourage your patients to do the same.

Young people often believe they’re invincible. Cross that with all the messages that young people are unlikely to get seriously ill from the coronavirus, and you get kids congregating even though they’re being told not to. Changing youth behavior is hard. The best way to reach them is through their peers. I would really encourage engaging directly with young people and trying to develop a youth corps to spread the message. Find your youth advisory boards and the youth leaders who can say to their peers, “We don't want to be bridges to infection to our parents and grandparents.” I recently participated in a webinar with well over 100 Baltimore youth, and they asked great questions. I told them, "You all have this responsibility to get the word out there because what you do really matters." (Dr. Josh Sharfstein, 4/6/20) <SEP> How do we get through to the youth who feel they are immune to the disease or not affected by it? <EOS>
​Social Security offers an online disability application. Applying online for disability benefits offers several advantages:  You can start your disability claim immediately, there is no need to wait for an appointment and you can apply from the convenience of your home, or on any computer.  You can also apply by calling 1-800-772-1213 (TTY 1-800-325-0778), Monday through Friday from7 a.m. to 7 p.m. or by contacting your local Social Security office.It may take several months to process an application for disability benefits, so you should apply as soon as you become disabled. To apply for disability benefits, you will need to complete an application for Social Security Benefits and the Disability Report. You can complete the Disability Report online at www.ssa.gov/applyfordisability/. To identify what information you will need when you apply for Disability Benefits, go to: www.ssa.gov/online/ssa-16.html. You may also visit the SSA web site at www.ssa.gov/disability/ for the latest information regarding the Disability Program. <SEP> ​How do I apply for Social Security disability benefits? <EOS>
The amount of time it takes to get your test results back varies. For information regarding your test, contact the testing facility that ordered or collected the test. The COVID-19 Call Center cannot provide results, or provide a status update. <SEP> How do I get my COVID-19 test results? <EOS>
Not necessarily. Antibodies are a body’s response to bacteria or viruses. But this novel coronavirus is so new, it’s still not clear whether having antibodies to it means you have long-term protection from getting reinfected. 
“The thing we don’t know yet is what is the relationship between the level of antibody and the degree of your protection,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told Snapchat’s “Good Luck America” show. 
“So you may be positive for an antibody, but not enough to protect you.” 
There’s also a risk that some antibody tests might confuse the novel coronavirus with other coronaviruses, like the ones that cause the common cold. <SEP> Will an antibody test show whether I’m immune and can go back to work or school? <EOS>
DOH’s public health order is focused on areas that are generally accessible to the public. Right now, most behavioral health and long-term care facilities are closed to visitors. Staff at these facilities are required to wear face coverings consistent with L&I’s Safety and Health requirements. For residents, patients, and visitors, face covering requirements will be determined by the medical director of medical facilities. We are working with providers to formalize a Safe Start Plan for visitors to long-term care facilities. <SEP> What are the requirements for behavioral health and long-term care facilities? <EOS>
Deciding to close, partially close or reopen schools should be guided by a risk management approach to maximize the educational, well-being and health benefit for students, teachers, staff, and the wider community, and help prevent a new outbreak of COVID-19 in the community.The local situation and epidemiology of COVID-19 may vary from one place to another within a country, and several elements should be assessed in deciding to re-open schools or keep them open:1. Benefits and risks: what are the likely benefits and risks to children and staff of open schools? Including consideration of :Disease trends: are COVID-19 cases being reported in the area?Effectiveness of remote learning strategies Impact on vulnerable and marginalized populations (girls, displaced, disabled, etc.)2. Detection and response: are the local health authorities able to act quickly?3. Collaboration and coordination: is the school collaborating with local public health authorities?In addition to the local situation and epidemiology, a careful assessment of the school setting and ability to maintain COVID-19 prevention and control measures needs to be included in the overall risk analysis. <SEP> What should be considered when deciding whether to re-open schools or keep them open? <EOS>
Yes. US health officials have indicated that the COVID-19 virus can indeed be spread by infected individuals prior to the onset of symptoms such as coughing, fever, and shortness of breath. National and international health organizations working to mitigate the spread of the virus are still collecting data on asymptomatic transmission (transmission by people who show no symptoms).

It’s been at least 24 hours with no fever without using fever-reducing medication AND
Your symptoms have improved, AND
At least 10 days since symptoms first appeared.


If you test positive for COVID-19, but have not had any symptoms, you can end home isolation when:
 
At least 10 days have passed since the date of your first positive COVID-19 test, AND
You have had no subsequent illness. <SEP> How long do I need to isolate if I test positive for COVID-19? <EOS>
An immunity passport would be a physical or digital document given to people who have recovered from COVID-19 and are believed to be neither susceptible to reinfection nor infectious themselves for a period of time. It is important to note, however, that at this time the reliability of antibody tests to assess resistance or immunity is unknown.
In addition to questions about accuracy, there are major concerns about discrimination and the idea’s potential to create an incentive for some to contract the virus deliberately. (Dr. Josh Sharfstein and Dutch Leonard, 5/27/20) <SEP> What are “immunity passports”?  Should we be planning for them in our cities? <EOS>
The commercial manufacturers in the list below provided notification to the FDA that they validated and intended to distribute a diagnostic test as set forth in Section IV.C of the Policy for Coronavirus Disease-2019 Tests. The FDA had previously included them on the website notification list of commercial manufacturers distributing diagnostic test kits under that policy, but they have now been removed from that notification list and placed on the list below. As noted in the guidance, if an EUA request is not submitted by a commercial manufacturer of a diagnostic test within a reasonable period of time, or if significant problems are identified with such a test that cannot be or have not been addressed in a timely manner, the FDA intends to remove the manufacturer and test from the notification list. Commercial manufacturers may also voluntarily withdraw their test notification, and such tests are noted with an asterisk.
The FDA expects that the tests on this list will not be distributed unless and until an EUA is issued for the test, and the FDA may take additional actions as appropriate.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, employers  should consider training workers about:

The basics of how SARS-CoV-2, the virus that  causes COVID-19, spreads;
Their risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 on the job;
Appropriate cleaning and disinfection in the workplace.
Measures being taken to protect them from exposure  and infection, including handwashing, covering coughs and sneezes, social distancing,  and use of any necessary workplace controls and/or personal protective equipment  (PPE);
What employees should do if they are sick, including  staying home and reporting any signs/symptoms of COVID-19 to their supervisor.

Some OSHA standards require employers to provide specific training to workers. For example, there are training requirements in OSHA's PPE standards (29 CFR Part 1910, Subpart I), including the Respiratory Protection standard (29 CFR 1910.134).
The training that is necessary can vary depending on a worker's job tasks, exposure risks, and the type of controls  implemented to protect workers.

The most common signs of COVID-19 are a fever,
               cough, and trouble breathing. Some people might have:

symptoms of a cold such as a sore
               throat, congestion, or a runny nose
chills
muscle pain
headache
a loss of taste or smell
nausea or vomiting
diarrhea
tiredness

Some kids are having symptoms caused by inflammation
               throughout the body, sometimes several weeks after they were infected with the virus.
               This is called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in
               children (MIS-C). Doctors are trying to find out how these symptoms are related
               to coronavirus infection.
Symptoms of MIS-C can include:

fever 
belly pain
vomiting or diarrhea
neck pain
a rash
red eyes
feeling very tired
red, cracked lips
swollen hands or feet
swollen lymph nodes

People suspected of being infected by the COVID-19 virus will have respiratory samples (i.e. mucus) taken by healthcare professionals that will then be analyzed by public health labs, hospital labs, or commercial labs like LabCorp or Quest. Healthcare professionals will work with public health departments and the CDC to determine who needs to be tested. The CDC advises that people who feel sick with fever or cough or have difficulty breathing, and who have been in close contact with a person known to have COVID-19, live in a community where COVID-19 is spreading, or have recently traveled from areas where COVID-19 has spread, should call their healthcare provider for further guidance.

Long term care facilities in New Jersey, such as nursing homes and assisted living facilities, are required to report many communicable disease cases, including COVID-19, to their local health departments. Local health departments then work with the Department of Health and the facility administrators to ensure that appropriate measures are being taken.
If you have reason to believe that a long term care facility is not reporting its communicable disease cases appropriately, please contact your local health department.
If a long term care facility is not providing the family of a loved one with information about whether the facility has a patient or patients with COVID-19, that family member should call the NJ Department of Health complaint hotline at 1-800-792-9770. Callers may remain anonymous.
The 24-hour hotline handles consumer complaints and facility emergencies seven days a week. Patients, health care facility employees and other members of the public may file complaints about hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, home health agencies, nursing homes, assisted living facilities, comprehensive personal care homes, adult medical day care, pediatric medical day facilities, and many other licensed acute- and long-term care facilities.
If you are willing to identify yourself, you can also file a complaint online with the New Jersey Department of Health.
If you have first-hand knowledge of illegal activity or other misconduct at a nursing home or a long-term care facility during the COVID-19 outbreak, please fill out this online reporting form (covid19.nj.gov/ltc) from the New Jersey Attorney General's Office.
If you have any documents that demonstrate the misconduct you are reporting, you may upload them through the form. If you prefer, you can remain anonymous, but the more detailed your submission, the more helpful it will be for investigators.
Note: This form is designed to further an ongoing statewide investigation, not to answer specific questions about a long-term care facility or someone living at one.

The general guidelines outlined in the General Principles of Food Hygiene for food processing and manufacture premises should be followed. If a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19 is identified in a food premises then there is a requirement to completely clean the area with a neutral detergent, followed by decontamination of surfaces using a disinfectant effective against viruses. All surfaces that the infected employee has come into contact with must be cleaned, including all surfaces and objects which are visibly contaminated with body fluids/respiratory secretions, and all potentially contaminated high-contact areas such as toilets, door handles, telephones. Alcohol based sanitizers/surface disinfectants should be used for cleaning purposes. In general, alcohol-based disinfectants (ethanol, propan-2-ol, propan-1-ol) have been shown to significantly reduce infectivity of enveloped viruses like SARS-CoV-2, in concentrations of 70-80% with one-minute exposure time. Chlorine-based disinfectants (sodium hypochlorite) are effective for surface decontamination, as are disinfectants with active ingredients based on quaternary ammonium compounds (QUATS).All staff should wash their hands thoroughly for 20 seconds after any contact with someone who is unwell with symptoms consistent with coronavirus infection. Staff engaged in environmental cleaning should wear PPE when performing cleaning activities, such as overalls or uniform, single-use plastic aprons, gloves and a face mask. Protective clothing (e.g. uniforms, overalls, etc.) should be frequently washed at 60°C or above. <SEP> How should food premises be cleaned/disinfected during this pandemic? <EOS>
Most people who get COVID-19 will be able to recover at home. CDC has directions for people who are recovering at home and their caregivers, including:

Stay home when you are sick, except to get medical care.
Use a separate room and bathroom for sick household members (if possible).
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.
If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.
Provide your sick household member with clean disposable facemasks to wear at home, if available, to help prevent spreading COVID-19 to others.
Clean the sick room and bathroom, as needed, to avoid unnecessary contact with the sick person.

However, some people may need emergency medical attention. Watch for symptoms and learn when to seek emergency medical attention.
When to Seek Emergency Medical Attention
Look for emergency warning signs* for COVID-19. If someone is showing any of these signs, seek emergency medical care immediately

Trouble breathing
Persistent pain or pressure in the chest
New confusion
Inability to wake or stay awake
Bluish lips or face

*This list is not all possible symptoms. Please call your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you.

Under the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination (LAD), schools and other places of public accommodation must take action to stop harassment based on race, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, disability, and other protected characteristics if they know or should have known about it, even if the harasser is another student. These protections apply even if the conduct at issue stems from concerns related to COVID-19.
Schools and other places of public accommodation must take action to stop bias-based harassment if they know or should have known about it, even if the harassment comes from another patient, customer, or student. These protections apply even if the conduct at issue stems from concerns related to COVID-19.
For example, if a classmate repeatedly tells your child that they must have COVID-19 because they are from China, the school could be liable if you reported it and the school did not investigate or take action.
Similarly, if someone on a public bus sees that you are wearing a yarmulke and starts screaming that "Jews are spreading the virus," the LAD requires the bus driver and bus company to take action to stop the harassment.
The LAD prohibits retaliation against a person for complaining about discrimination or bias-based harassment, or otherwise exercising or attempting to exercise their rights under the law.
For more information or to file a complaint, please visit NJCivilRights.gov, review DCR's guidance on Civil Rights and COVID-19, or call 973-648-2700.

The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, and tiredness. Other symptoms that are less common and may affect some patients include aches and pains, nasal congestion, headache, conjunctivitis, sore throat, diarrhea, loss of taste or smell or a rash on skin or discoloration of fingers or toes. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but only have very mild symptoms. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing hospital treatment. Around 1 out of every 5 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart and lung problems, diabetes, or cancer, are at higher risk of developing serious illness.  However, anyone can catch COVID-19 and become seriously ill.  People of all ages who experience fever and/or  cough associated withdifficulty breathing/shortness of breath, chest pain/pressure, or loss of speech or movement should seek medical attention immediately. If possible, it is recommended to call the health care provider or facility first, so the patient can be directed to the right clinic.Video: Five things to know about COVID-19 transmission <SEP> What are the symptoms of COVID-19? <EOS>
 The Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) will follow the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) guidance for reporting notifiable disease jurisdictions which, for college students, will be the place of usual residence in an academic year such as the city/town where they attend college for most of the year. Regarding notifiable diseases, according to Alabama law, all physicians, dentists, nurses, medical examiners, hospital administrators, nursing home administrators, lab directors, school principals, and day care directors are responsible for reporting notifiable diseases. Thus, college health services will report to the Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH), and ADPH will also receive results from laboratories. <SEP>  If a college student tests positive, will ADPH report the case from where their college is located? Does the college or the lab report the positive result to ADPH? <EOS>
If the decedent is suspected to have had COVID-19, it is prudent to assume others in the building where the death occurred could be infected. In addition, while body fluids other than respiratory secretions have not been clearly implicated in transmission of COVID-19, unprotected contact with other body fluids, including blood, stool, vomit, and urine, might put the investigator at risk of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases.

Gather information regarding the circumstances of the death (as is standard practice) to aid in the hazard/risk assessment, including risk for possible COVID-19 and whether droplets, aerosols, body fluids, purge, or decomposition materials were expelled before or after the death.
Plan for and implement physical distancing measures

Minimize close contact with anyone at the scene, including family members, responsible person(s) of the decedent, and witnesses.
Arrange to conduct pre-investigation interviews by telephone or video conference, if possible.
If interviews cannot be conducted by telephone or other virtual means, conduct interviews outside the residence or building where the death occurred or in other outdoor spaces. During any in-person interview or other interactions, the investigator should practice physical distancing of at least 6 feet and encourage all persons being interviewed to do the same.
The investigator and those being interviewed should wear cloth face coverings during the in-person interviews, especially if physical distancing of 6 feet or more cannot be maintained. Be aware of and follow state and local ordinances regarding use of face coverings.


If the investigator determines that it is necessary to enter the residence or building where the death occurred, then it is important to:

Carefully plan equipment needed for the investigation to avoid bringing unnecessary items into the structure. Plan to have extra face coverings for household members.
Set up separate, designated locations for donning and doffing PPE outside the structure. The doffing station should be physically separated from the donning station because used PPE could be contaminated. Make sure the doffing station has hand sanitizer, disinfectant sprays or wipes, and waste containers or biohazard bags for used PPE. See Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-approved disinfectants external iconfor use against SARS-CoV-2.
Inquire if any persons in the building where the death occurred are experiencing symptoms consistent with COVID-19 (which may include fever, cough, shortness of breath) or have been diagnosed with COVID-19 or are awaiting test results. These individuals should be asked to remain outdoors or in a room of the structure that does not need to be accessed during the investigation.
Ask anyone remaining inside the structure to wear facemasks or cloth face coverings and keep the face covering on throughout the investigation. The investigator should also wear a face covering throughout the investigation (see below for further details regarding respiratory protection).
Alert all persons in the structure that the investigator will be entering and ask anyone remaining in the structure to move to a different room if possible, or to maintain physical distancing of at least 6 feet from the investigator.

Smoking marijuana, nicotine, or vape e-cigarettes leads to damage to lungs and airways that may put you at further risk of harm from a COVID-19 infection.  Cannabis and nicotine are among many substances currently being studied in the context of COVID-19, but no data are available yet.  In the interim, the harms of smoking to your airways are well-established in the medical literature. <SEP> Is it safe to use cigarettes, marijuana, or CBD oil during the pandemic?

Available evidence suggests that transmission among children in schools is less efficient for COVID-19 than for other respiratory viruses such as influenza. However, this evidence is mainly derived from school outbreaks and relies on the detection of symptomatic cases, possibly underestimating the number of infected, asymptomatic, and potentially infectious, children during such an outbreak.
In summary, where COVID-19 in children has been detected and contacts followed-up, no adult contacts in school settings have been detected as COVID-19-positive during the follow-up period. The conclusion from these investigations is that children in school settings are not the primary drivers of COVID-19 transmission to adults. <SEP> 4. Do schools spread the virus to the wider community? <EOS>
The COVID-19 virus has not been detected in drinking water. Conventional water treatment methods used in most municipal drinking water systems should remove or inactivate COVID-19. <SEP> Can the COVID-19 virus spread through drinking water? <EOS>
It’s best to take the stairs if you can. But if you can’t, emergency room physician Dr. Leana Wen offers several tips: 

Wear a mask. Not only does wearing a mask reduce your risk of inhaling the virus — which can linger in the air for 8 minutes — it also helps reduce your chances of infecting others if you are an asymptomatic carrier. 
Use a tissue to push the elevator buttons. If you don’t have a tissue, use your elbow, then wash or disinfect that area when you can.
Try to keep your distance from anyone else inside the elevator as much as possible. <SEP> How can I stay safe in an elevator? <EOS>
I encourage allowing people to be outdoors, get sun, and breathe fresh air—as long as they are able to maintain six feet of distance from one another. This doesn't have to be a sequestration in your home. Going outside and getting exercise is good for mental and physical health. In instances where there are few outdoor spaces and crowding is a concern, you could create a system where residents with last names A-D can use the park during this hour, E-H during the next, and so on.

The CDC advises that children are no more susceptible to the virus than the general population. Children who are infected with the coronavirus usually have mild respiratory symptoms. As this situation develops, researchers are working to better understand how children are affected. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) is collecting information about this topic daily. It's important to note that even without displaying symptoms children who may be infected with the COVID-19 virus could spread it to others. On 10 March 2020 the International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC), UNICEF and the World Health Organization (WHO) issued guidance to help protect children and schools from transmission of the COVID-19 virus.
Drafted 11 March 2020 <SEP> How does the coronavirus affect children? <EOS>
If you can, sit next to your child and hold their hand or rub their arm while you
               talk with them. If you can't sit next to your child, reach out and touch them. Sing
               a favorite song, show a short video, read a special book. If your child is old enough,

There is no evidence at this point that the Bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccine (BCG) protects people against infection with COVID-19 virus. Clinical trials addressing this question are underway, and WHO will evaluate the evidence when it is available.

COVID-19 is a virus strain, primarily spread through respiratory droplets. That means to become infected, you generally must be within six feet of someone who is contagious and come into contact with these droplets. It may be possible to get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching your mouth, nose, or possibly your eyes. People with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness.
Symptoms of COVID-19 may appear two to 14 days after exposure and include:

Fever or chills.
Cough.
Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.
Fatigue.
Muscle or body aches.
Headache.
New loss of taste or smell.
Sore throat.
Congestion or runny nose.
Nausea or vomiting.
Diarrhea.

This list does not include all possible symptoms. Children have similar symptoms to adults and generally have mild illness. <SEP> What is COVID-19? <EOS>
The Department of Health recommends testing anyone with symptoms consistent with COVID-19.
DOH also recommends testing for people with likely exposures, such as close contacts of cases, or those exposed in outbreak situations.
If you have symptoms consistent with COVID-19, contact your health care provider. If you don’t have a health care provider, contact an urgent care center near you. If don’t have health insurance, contact your local health jurisdiction.
See our guidance for health care providers.
We're working to expand testing so that anyone who gets sick with symptoms of COVID-19 can quickly get tested.
However, testing is very important for public health so that disease transmission can be tracked and interrupted.

If you have a fever, cough, or shortness of breath, it’s best to treat it like it could be COVID-19. Protect others by staying home. If you must be around other people, you should wear a mask.
If you're concerned about your health, call your health care provider to discuss COVID-19 testing and other possible reasons for your illness. You can also use the online Coronavirus Assessment Tool developed by Providence and Microsoft.
If you have symptoms and are at a higher risk for complications from severe respiratory infections (e.g., for example, you are older than 60, have a chronic medical condition or immunosuppression, or are pregnant), call your health care provider to ask about COVID-19 testing and testing and treatment for other infections, such as flu or pneumonia.
If you don’t have a regular health care provider, you can use the online Coronavirus Assessment Tool developed by Providence and Microsoft.

We have additional guidance on testing and steps you can take to prevent the spread of COVID-19:

Regular physical activity benefits both the body and
mind. It can reduce high blood pressure, help manage weight and reduce the risk
of heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and various cancers. It also
improves bone and muscle strength and increases balance, flexibility and
fitness. For older people, activities that improve balance help to prevent
falls and injuries. For children, regular physical activity helps support
healthy growth and development and reduce the risk of disease in later life,
and through regular activity, children can develop fundamental movement skills
and build social relationships.Regular physical activity also improves mental health
and can reduce the risk of depression, cognitive decline and delay the onset of
dementia - and improve overall feelings of wellbeing. <SEP> Why do we need it? <EOS>
Yes, if you are experiencing symptoms associated with COVID-19, your employer can require that you undergo a medical examination before allowing you to return to work. The PA Medical Pay Law states that if your employer requires you to undergo a medical examination in order to return to work, then your employer is responsible for paying for that examination unless another statute requires a medical examination as a condition for employment.  Furthermore, time spent at a doctor's office waiting for an examination or receiving medical attention at the direction of your employer is considered hours worked if the examination occurs during your normal working hours. Time spent undergoing a medical examination during a day you are off work is not compensable. If you are a member of a union, your collective bargaining agreement (union contract) may provide direction regarding your rights and requisite medical examinations.The Department of Health also issued guidance for businesses that are life-essential and opened during the COVID-19 outbreak. <SEP> ​If I am experiencing symptoms associated with COVID-19, can my employer require that I undergo a medical examination before allowing me to return to work? <EOS>
Phase 2 will be in place until data shows the state is prepared to move forward with Phase 3.

Due to a national shortage of testing supplies and the high demand for testing, many clinics are running out of tests daily. Until the clinic can obtain more COVID-19 testing supplies, they are referring people to other clinics in the area that have supplies. This changes on a day-to-day basis. Please reference the testing site map for another nearby location and contact that provider. <SEP> I called one of the clinics on the website and was told that I can’t get a test there. Why not? <EOS>
 No, members who are not federally funded under Title XIX (for example, members with a Serious Mental Illness determination who do not qualify for Medicaid) are not exempt from disenrollment during the public health emergency. <SEP>  Are non-Medicaid members who are covered under state-only funding, also protected from disenrollment? <EOS>

Give your room a really good clean if it needs it and/or sort all of your possessions. Offer to help out with cleaning around the house or yard/garden. These activities are boring but if you do them now, you won't have to do them when you have better things to do. You could suggest that your family does something together, such as playing a board game or charades. Have a treasure hunt for coins down the back of the sofa or lost jewellery under furniture. Bake, create art, call a relative or friend you haven't spoken to for a while. Binge watch favorited films and shows. Tidy your garden if you have one; being out in nature can help keep you sane. Read wikiHow's many Boredom Buster articles for more ideas. <SEP> I am an only teenager, and my family has decided to self quarantine out of caution. My school has shut down. It’s only been 12 hours and I’m already bored. Any suggestions? I have lots of time to fill. <EOS>
Not all patients with COVID-19 require hospital admission. Patients whose clinical presentation warrants in-patient clinical management for supportive medical care should be admitted to the hospital under appropriate isolation precautions. Some patients with an initial mild clinical presentation may worsen in the second week of illness. The decision to monitor these patients in the inpatient or outpatient setting should be made on a case-by-case basis. This decision will depend not only on the clinical presentation, but also on the patient's ability to engage in monitoring, the ability for safe isolation at home, and the risk of transmission in the patient's home environment.

Personal care and grooming businesses may open in Phase 2 and they must comply with the following:
Limit customers to Emergency Maximum Occupancy.
Arrange seating so that groups of customers are separated from one another by 6 feet.
Mark 6 feet of spacing in lines at point of sale and in other high-traffic areas for customers, such as cash registers and waiting areas.
Post the Emergency Maximum Occupancy in a noticeable place.
Post signs requesting that people who have been sick with a fever and/or cough not enter.
Conduct daily symptom screening of workers, using a standard interview questionnaire of symptoms, before workers enter the workplace.
Immediately isolate and remove sick workers.
Perform frequent and routine environmental cleaning and disinfection of high-touch areas with an EPA-approved disinfectant for SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID- 19).
Ensure that all equipment that comes into direct personal contact with customers and all furniture in service areas (such as chairs, capes and the shampooing area in a barber shop or salon) is completely cleaned and disinfected between each customer.
Employees of personal care and grooming businesses must wear face coverings at all times while in the business.
It is also strongly recommended that customers at personal care and grooming businesses wear a face covering at all times while in the business and that businesses institute an appointment process and encourage people wait in their vehicle or offsite before being served.
Personal care and grooming businesses include but are not limited to: barber shops beauty salons; waxing and hair removal centers; hair salons; nail salons; manicure or pedicure providers; tattoo parlors; tanning salons; and massage therapists/businesses. <SEP> What requirements do personal care and grooming businesses need to follow? <EOS>
The answer to this question depends on: 1) how much time has passed since the initial illness onset; and 2) whether the individual has developed symptoms after an initial period of recovery.

Residents and HCP who had their initial positive viral test in the past 3 months and who are now asymptomatic do not need to be retested as part of facility-wide testing. Until more is known, testing should be considered again (e.g., in response to an exposure) 3 months after the date of onset of the prior infection.
Residents and HCP who had a positive viral test at any time and become symptomatic after recovering from the initial illness should be evaluated and may need to be retested if an alternate illness etiology cannot be identified.

This guidance may be updated as we learn more information on how long SARS-CoV-2 may persist and risks for reinfection. <SEP> Do residents or healthcare personnel (HCP) who previously had SARS-CoV-2 confirmed by viral testing (e.g., reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, RT-PCR) and who have recently recovered need to be re-tested as part of facility-wide testing? <EOS>
So that more people can lead lives closer to normal, the Government is replacing national restrictions with local action to contain local outbreaks.

The odds of transmitting coronavirus through sex hasn’t been thoroughly studied, though it has been found to exist in men’s semen.
But we do know Covid-19 is a highly contagious respiratory illness that can spread via saliva, coughs, sneezes, talking or breathing — with or without symptoms of illness.
So three Harvard physicians examined the likelihood of getting or giving Covid-19 during sex and made several recommendations. 
For partners who haven’t been isolating together, people should wear masks and avoid kissing, the authors write.
In addition to wearing masks, people who have sex with partners outside of their home should also shower before and after; avoid sex acts that involve the oral transmission of bodily fluids; clean up the area afterward with soap or alcohol wipes to reduce their likelihood of infection. <SEP> Can you get Covid-19 through sex? <EOS>
People with symptoms, or those who have been exposed to someone with COVID-19, should contact their primary care provider (PCP) for testing or referral so the provider can coordinate care. They can also visit a State of Delaware community-based testing site; no referral is needed.

 During this unprecedented public health emergency, the Agency has received an exceedingly high volume of EUA requests and is working as quickly as possible to review each request. There are hundreds of pre-EUA and EUA requests for COVID-19 tests under review and FDA continues to receive new submissions on a daily basis. To address this high volume of work, we have brought in additional scientific review staff to double the number of teams working on submissions; and we have implemented a triage program to prioritize submissions based on several factors. As a result of these efforts, by June 1, 2020, FDA had authorized over 125 diagnostic and serological tests, far exceeding the number of test EUAs issued during previous emergencies.
As explained in FDA's guidance "Emergency Use Authorization of Medical Products and Related Authorities," starting on page 18, FDA prioritizes EUA requests based on several factors that include, but are not limited to, the public health need of the product (e.g., point-of-care; high throughput), the extent to which the product would serve a significant unmet medical need (e.g., at-home specimen collection; at-home testing), and the availability and adequacy of the information concerning the likelihood that the product may be safe and effective in preventing, treating, or diagnosing the condition, as well as the availability of the product (e.g., the quantity and manufacturing capacity).
FDA strives to review Pre-EUA and EUA requests as quickly as we can. FDA will communicate with each sponsor regarding its pre-EUA or EUA request as soon as possible.  The review team will be in contact with you when their review is complete or if there are questions.  If you have not yet been assigned a lead reviewer for your pre-EUA or EUA request, we recommend that you refer to the available resources to help you with your planning and submitting your EUA request:

In situations like a pandemic it is very normal to feel anxious and powerless, and that is ok. Here are a few suggestions on things that could help you proactively manage your anxiety: Think about how you are feeling. Don’t ignore your feelings, especially if you don’t feel well. When your life is disrupted, it is normal to have many different feelings: worry, frustration, sad, stress, anger, anxiety - this can happen to everyone.  Draw on skills and strategies you have used in the past that have helped you to manage life challenges, and skills to help you manage your emotions. Here are a few examples:Keep a diary Express your feelings through art, like writing a poem, drawing, dancing, or playing music Talk about your feelings and concerns with someone you trust Try some breathing exercises. You may find guided breathing exercises online if you have access to internet.  Do something active every day: Any exercise will help, as it reduces levels of the body's stress hormones, which can help your body and mind relax. Exercise also produces a “feel good hormone” called endorphins which can help to improve your mood. Try taking a walk, running, or any physical activity outdoors while keeping a distance from others. For those who are unable to leave the house, you could open the window for fresh air and do some indoor exercises to stay active. Don’t use smoking, eating, alcohol or other drugs to deal with your emotions. Stay connected with friends and family either by communicating with them by phone or internet if you can., If you live close to them and the local rules allow you to, you could also talk to them in person while keeping your distance.Keep a daily routine as much as possible. Try to go to bed and wake up at the same times every day, making sure you get enough sleep. Plan ahead and try to have a balance of activities such as keeping up with schoolwork, physical exercise, connecting with friends and family, doing things you enjoy, and eating regular meals. Talk to a health worker or counsellor if you, or someone you care about:feel overwhelmed with emotions like sadness, fears and worries feel like stress gets in the way of your daily routines, orfeel like you want to harm yourself or others. At this time, you may find it easier to speak to a counsellor than a health worker, given that there may be restrictions on movement and health facilities may be busy caring for those with COVID-19.   Read more: https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/coping-with-stress.pdf https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/helping-children-cope-with-stress-print.pdf https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/mental-health-considerations.pdf https://www.un.org/youthenvoy/2020/04/copingwithcovid-a-webinar-series-on-young-people-and-mental-health/ https://www.voicesofyouth.org/campaign/covid-19-and-youth-mental-health <SEP> I am feeling really anxious about COVID-19 and its impact on my life.

Taking care of your pearly whites is not just a good beauty habit; it’s also essential for your health. With all the baking and drinking we’ve been doing during lockdown, you’re going to need a visit sooner rather than later. In fact, that’s part of the reason economists are using dentists as a bellwether for comfort about reopening writ large.
Dentists have mobilized and are ready to accommodate visitors. (Telehealth, for obvious reasons, isn’t an option for most dental cases.) Dentists and hygienists should wear head-to-toe personal protective equipment and change between appointments.
Getting the first appointment of the day may also limit risk, though many dentists said they are seeing fewer patients so they have more time to disinfect rooms between visits. But the risk might be more to the providers than it is to the patients; they keep their mask on while you take yours off. 
Before you go, speak with your dentist about how crucial your check-up is right now. If cases are rising where you live, maybe check back in next month if your dental issue can wait. <SEP> What about the dentist? <EOS>
 The approach to modifications depends on the type of modification, as described below.
As discussed in the Policy for Coronavirus Disease-2019 Tests, when a laboratory makes a modification to an EUA authorized test for use of a new specimen type, FDA does not intend to object to the use of such a modified test without notification to FDA or a new or amended EUA where the new specimen type has been previously authorized for another test of the same technology and where the EUA-authorized test is validated for the new specimen type. Note that for all current EUAs for COVID-19 tests, such modifications would be outside the scope of and not authorized under the EUA. The Policy for Coronavirus Disease-2019 Tests does not include validation using a bridging study when validating a modification involving a new specimen type. The Molecular Diagnostic Templates referenced in the guidance and linked from FDA's webpage include recommendations for validation of a new specimen type (i.e., alternative, non-respiratory specimens).
Modifications to an EUA-authorized test for use of a new specimen type that has not been previously authorized for another test of the same technology must be authorized under a new or amended EUA prior to clinical use.
For all other types of modifications, FDA does not intend to object to the use of a test (despite that the modification is outside the scope of the EUA), without notification to the FDA or a new or amended EUA, where the test is a modification of an EUA-authorized test and the modified test is validated using a bridging study to the EUA-authorized test. Note that such modifications are outside the scope of the EUA and are not authorized under the EUA. One way to bridge to a new component is to establish equivalent performance between parallel testing of the same specimens with the new and original components. We recommend testing 3-fold serial dilutions of SARS-CoV-2 viral materials (e.g., whole genomic viral RNA or inactivated virus, etc.) in a pooled respiratory sample matrix in triplicate until you achieve a hit rate of <100%. If the resultant Limit of Detection (LoD) is the same as the LoD for the unmodified authorized test (i.e., ≤3xLOD), then FDA believes the two tests can be considered to have equivalent performance. As noted in the guidance, validation using this bridging approach is for modifications other than adding a new specimen type.
As noted in the guidance, in these cases, while the FDA does not intend to object where no EUA request is submitted, FDA would like to see your validation data through an email to CDRH-EUA-Templates@FDA.HHS.GOV to see if the bridged validation data could be applicable to modifications of other tests with an EUA, or to other laboratories modifying the same authorized tests. If it could be, and the laboratory agrees to FDA sharing that information on our website for use by other laboratories, the FDA intends to update our FAQs for other laboratories who want to refer to the validation for their testing, without conducting their own study for the same modification. This sharing of data is not considered to be a notification, a pre-EUA submission or EUA request. FDA is looking at this data only for the reasons set forth above. If you intend to pursue an EUA for modifications to an EUA-authorized test, please refer to the applicable EUA template for information on the data for a submission, including appropriate validation data, which may include bridging studies in lieu of independent validation.
The CDC has granted a right of reference to the performance data contained in the CDC's EUA request (FDA submission number EUA200001) to any entity seeking an FDA EUA for a COVID-19 diagnostic device. Laboratories bridging to another EUA-authorized assay must obtain a right of reference to leverage the performance data for that EUA-authorized assay. <SEP>  I am a high-complexity CLIA-certified laboratory developing a COVID-19 assay that is a modification of a previously EUA authorized COVID-19 assay.

General infection prevention and control measures to optimize use along with contingency capacity strategies should be implemented. This includes limiting the number of patients going to the hospital or outpatient settings, limiting face-to-face healthcare provider encounters with patients by bundling care activities, excluding non-essential personnel from entering the patient care areas, wearing the same N95 respirator for repeated close contact encounters with several patients, and potentially using N95 respirators beyond the manufacturer-designated shelf life. Facilities should report supply chain issues to their Regional Healthcare Coalition.  The coalition may be able to leverage existing resources. Additional CDC guidance can be found here.
The Virginia Emergency Support Team (VEST) has coordinated with Amazon to ensure organizations on the frontlines of the COVID-19 response in the Commonwealth can purchase critically needed personal protective equipment (PPE) through Amazon Business on a prioritized basis.  This opportunity is available to hospitals, health clinics, doctor’s offices, and other medical care providers. In order to participate in this program, a business must first sign up on Amazon Business.  The link to sign up can be accessed using this url:  https://business.amazon.com/en/work-with-us/healthcare/covid-19-supplies.

You don’t have to stay at home anymore but when you leave your home, you should follow the guidelines on staying safe outside your home.
As businesses reopen and people begin to socialise more regularly, you should maintain social distancing from people you do not live with or are not in your support bubble, and should wash your hands regularly. This will help to protect you and anyone you come into contact with and is critical to keeping everyone as safe as possible.
The more people you have interactions with, the more chance the virus has to spread. Therefore, try to limit the number of people you see – especially over short periods of time.
If you or someone in your household or your support bubble is showing coronavirus symptoms, everyone in your support bubble should self-isolate, stay at home and get a test. If you or a member of your support bubble is contacted as part of the test and trace programme, the individual contacted should stay at home. If that individual becomes symptomatic, everyone in the support bubble must then isolate. This is critical to staying safe and saving lives.

The National Institutes of Health and Gilead Sciences worked together to conduct a randomized controlled clinical trial of the investigational drug in hospitalized patients. Preliminary results suggested that remdesivir was associated with faster recovery, although the data was not sufficient to determine if the drug was associated with lower mortality.  Preliminary results indicate that patients who received remdesivir had a 31% faster time to recovery than those who received placebo (p<0.001). Specifically, the median time to recovery was 11 days for patients treated with remdesivir compared with 15 days for those who received placebo. Results also suggested a survival benefit, with a mortality rate of 8.0% for the group receiving remdesivir versus 11.6% for the placebo group (p=0.059). <SEP> Why did the FDA authorize emergency use of remdesivir? <EOS>

            devices you may use, and prescription medicines). Alternatively, ask family members, caregivers, neighbours or community leaders to help with ordering and/or delivery of groceries or prescription medicines. Make sure that your mobile phone
            credit is topped up and identify a safe place to charge your phone regularly so that you can keep in contact with family and friends and reach emergency services if needed.   Make a list of emergency numbers (e.g. COVID-19 local helpline, nearby hospital and health emergencies numbers, hotline for victims of abuse, psychosocial support hotline) and support contacts (e.g. family members
            and friends, main caregiver, community care worker, associations of older persons). If you live alone, you may wish to share this list and ask your neighbours, family or caregiver to be in touch regularly, for example, by phone or video chat. Discuss with your health-care worker how your health needs can be addressed during COVID-19. This may involve postponing non-urgent appointments, talking to your doctor or health-care worker by phone or video chat instead
            of in person and/or revising your vaccination schedule. If you rely on the support provided by a caregiver, identify with him or her another person that you trust to support your daily living and care needs in case your caregiver is unable to continue to provide
            care. Together, you can note down all the personal care and assistance that you require and how it should be provided and share it with this trusted person so that they can be ready to provide care in case of need.  If you are the primary caregiver of another person who is care dependent (e.g. grandchild, older spouse, child with a disability), identify a person that you and the person that you care for trust to take on your caregiving responsibilities in case you fall sick.
 Local authorities or volunteer organizations that provide support in these situations in your community might be able to help. If multiple people live in your home, if possible prepare a separate room or space in your home so that anyone showing symptoms compatible with COVID-19 can be isolated from others. If you do not have space for self-isolation,
            contact your community leaders or local health authorities to see if there is community space that could help you or other household members self-isolate. Think about what matters most to you regarding care and support, including medical treatment, in case something happens to you and you are unable to make your own decisions. If you want to develop an advanced care plan to record
            your treatment and care wishes, you can talk about it with your health-care worker or someone that you trust. You can write down your wishes and  share them with people you trust. <SEP> What can older people do to prepare for COVID-19 in their community? <EOS>
To protect the health and safety of the older residents, the State has taken several steps including:

Temporarily allowing supervising nurses to conduct required plan-of-care evaluations by phone or video-chat instead of in person. This limits the number of health care providers required to visit patient homes on a routine basis and guards against the spread of COVID-19 from healthcare workers to elderly and medically fragile individuals by making in-person supervisory visits, which typically occur at least every 60 days, unnecessary. The rule waiver, which takes effect immediately, will remain in place throughout the COVID-19 state of emergency.
Mobilizing nurse care managers at Medicaid health plans to call high risk populations to identify and address their critical needs including supplies such as durable medical equipment and food;
Allowing older residents receiving prescription drugs through Medicaid or the state prescription drug assistance program (PAAD and Senior Gold) to refill their prescriptions early, receive 90-day supplies of maintenance medications, and waiving signature requirements to reduce in-person contact;
Partnering with counties to end congregate dining in senior centers while helping to ensure that participants continue to have access to food;
Working with counties to support telephone outreach to seniors known to be socially isolated;
Encouraging health care providers to use telehealth for routine visits, as appropriate;
Working closely with community and institutional providers to ensure resident needs are met; and
Conducting telephonic outreach for our most vulnerable residents seeking enrollment in social service benefits.

With senior centers and nutrition sites closed to prevent the spread of COVID-19, the State is working with county-based Area Agencies on Aging (AAA) to safely deliver meals to older New Jerseyans most at risk of going hungry. Seniors unable to prepare their meals and have no family member, friend, neighbor, or caregiver to help, should contact their county AAA for assistance.
The State has also modified the Senior Farmers' Market Nutrition Program (SFMNP), which provides vouchers to farmers' markets, to ensure food assistance remains safe and accessible throughout the pandemic.
All certifications and re-certifications will be done remotely via telephone. Participants can complete a self-declaration of income and won't need to show proof of income eligibility for the program. Seniors can designate several proxies to pick up their produce on their behalf to limit risk of exposure. To learn more or to apply, visit the NJ Department of Health's Senior Farmers' Market Nutrition Program site.

To prepare yourself and your child:

Before the school year starts, check to make sure your internet access is up to
               date. Let the school know if you need help getting reliable access. Many school districts
               have WiFi hotspots they can share with students who need them.
Make sure your child has a device that can access the internet. Many schools have
               devices they can loan if you need one.
Some teaching might be done live with a teacher instructing a group of students
               in real time, but not in person (this is called synchronous learning).
               Students also can expect to learn at their own pace on their own time via videos or
               digital assignments (called asynchronous learning). You might need
               more than one program, app, or software on your child's device to do this. Download
               these before school starts. Most are free to download. Contact school staff if you
               need help. Some of this tech can be complicated at first, but will get easier each
               time you use it.
Stick to a routine. Have your child wake up at the same time each day and get
               dressed for the day. Set time for physical activity.
Create a schedule to help your child keep up with assignments. A calendar posted
               in sight of where your child learns can help.
Set up a learning space that is as free of noise and distractions as possible.
               Consider getting headphones for your child to reduce distractions (unless you also
               need to hear the teacher to help your child learn). Be flexible as you find what works
               best for your situation.
Plan to communicate often with the teacher. Let the teacher know what is going
               well and what is not. Work on solutions together.
If your child has an IEP or 504
               plan or therapies, find out how those will be done online.

Finding a therapist can be difficult, even under normal circumstances.
First, figure out what your insurance is and how you can pay for it. The logistical structures will make it a lot easier to move forward, and narrow down your choices for you. Of course, that’s not always an option — therapy can be time-intensive and expensive. You may not have insurance. If it is possible for you, though, here’s a quick guide.
Then, determine what type of professional you need. If you’re mostly looking to talk, a psychologist is a safe bet. Keep in mind that they do not prescribe medication. 
If you’re suffering from a specific ailment —  panic attacks, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, sociopathy, borderline personality disorder or schizophrenia — see a psychiatrist or a psychologist with considerable experience in that specialty. 
Then, set up a few preliminary calls and consultations. The getting-to-know-you session is often free, and you should take it as an opportunity to talk about what you are looking for from therapy, and how they approach their practice. 
You might click with someone, the way you would with a friend. And there’s nothing wrong with trying a few initial appointments to learn about your own wants and desires. Remote options are now widely available, so you can still attend sessions while staying distant. <SEP> How do I find a therapist? <EOS>
Food facilities, like other work establishments, need to follow protocols set by local and state health departments, which may vary depending on the amount of community spread of COVID-19 in a particular area. We encourage coordination with localExternal Link Disclaimer health officials for all businesses so that timely and accurate information can guide appropriate responses in each location where they have operations. Also see the CDC's What Grocery and Food Retail Workers Need to Know about COVID-19. <SEP> Where should the food industry go for guidance about business operations? (Updated April 20, 2020) <EOS>
Contact tracing is a method often used by public health to prevent the spread of disease. For COVID-19, contact tracing means ensuring that everyone who has been in close contact with a person diagnosed with COVID-19 is aware that they might have been exposed. The health department will check-in on the health status of people potentially exposed to the virus and provide them with information about how to prevent the spread of disease, including the importance of quarantine (which means staying at home and maintaining distance from others) and what to do if symptoms develop.
Contact tracers (the people who do contact tracing) won’t ask you for money or information like your social security number, bank account, or credit card number. Anyone who does is a scammer.
It is important to answer calls you receive from the health department. When you do, it helps us:

Understand what communities are affected by COVID-19.
Inform public health actions.
Understand who is at risk.
Follow up with high-risk groups.
Track the status of the COVID-19 outbreak in our state.
Determine when it is safe to return to public life.

Information collected during interviews is used only by public health agencies. The information is protected in secure systems and individual information is not shared with anyone else. Interviewers operate under strict confidentiality rules.

In the context of COVID-19, some children may not be able to wear a mask due to disabilities or specific situations such as speech classes where the teacher needs to see their mouths. In these cases, face shields may be considered an alternative to masks, but they do not provide the equivalent protection in keeping the virus from being transmitted to others.  If a decision is made to use a face shield, it should cover the entire face, wrap around the sides of the face and extend to below the chin. Caution should be taken while wearing one to avoid injuries that could break it and harm the eyes or face. <SEP> Are there alternatives to fabric masks such as face shields? <EOS>
Social distancing means keeping enough space between people to avoid the spread
               of germs. Experts say the right amount of space is about 6 feet (2 meters).
We all try not to get too close to people when they (or we) are sick with any contagious
               virus. But social distancing is more
               than staying away from people who are sick or coughing, or who don't feel well. It
               means keeping a safe distance from people who don't live with us, even people who
               look and feel perfectly healthy. Even though we feel perfectly healthy.
Social distancing is a new idea for most of us. But it's not new to scientists
               who study the spread of diseases. They know it's something we all can do to make a
               big difference in the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19). <SEP> What Is Social Distancing? <EOS>
Yes. All individual and small group health insurers are covering telemedicine services. This includes audio or visual communications.

Recently, ribonucleic acid (RNA) from the virus that causes COVID-19 has been found in untreated wastewater. While data are limited, there is little evidence of infectious virus in wastewater, and no information to date that anyone has become sick with COVID-19 because of exposure to wastewater. At this time, the risk of transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19 through properly designed and maintained sewerage systems is thought to be low. <SEP> Can the COVID-19 virus spread through sewerage systems? <EOS>
Maybe; not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19.
If you have symptoms of COVID-19 and want to get tested, call your healthcare provider first. Most people will have mild illness and can recover at home without medical care and may not need to be tested.

For most decisions, multiple ethical values and principles will be relevant to deliberations
about how to allocate resources. This is likely to generate some disagreement, because
different people may weigh the values differently. Some may prioritize equality while others
might put more emphasis on best outcomes or prioritization of the worst-off. For this reason,
it is imperative that the different values be weighed and applied to specific allocation issues
using a fair process.A fair process for allocating scarce resources must promote certain ethical values:Transparency. In a transparent process, the decisions and their justifications should
be made public. This means that the population should be informed about the criteria
guiding the decisions.Inclusiveness. Those affected by allocation decisions – including individuals,
communities or countries – should be able to exert at least some influence over the
decision-making process as well as the decision itself. This also means that decisions 
4
should be open to challenge and potentially revisable, perhaps through an appeal
process. Consistency. Decisions should be consistent so that all persons in the same categories
are treated in the same way. This means that favouritism towards one’s own family,
religious or political compatriots, or otherwise, is not appropriate. All forms of
corruption that are at variance with this principle should be challenged and
condemned. Accountability. Those making decisions about allocation must be accountable for
those decisions – that is, they should justify their decisions and be held responsible for
them. A fair process means that allocation decisions should not be made by
individuals, by individual pharmaceutical companies, or, in the case of allocation
between countries, by a single country. Resources such as vaccines and therapies
should not be stockpiled outside the system of fair allocation.The fair allocation of resources is one that is valuable in itself precisely because it is fair.
However, it may also be valuable because a fair system engenders solidarity and trust,
which are vital to the successful and sustained collective response necessary for dealing
effectively with any outbreak. <SEP> How should decision-makers make considered ethical judgements about these matters, given the likelihood that there will not be enough of a resource? Who should be involved in decision-making on scarce resources? <EOS>

In general, the usage of “Other Leave with Pay” for these reasons is of a shorter duration. We would not expect a manager to discuss scheduling vacation leave until the employee is no longer sick or experiencing symptoms, or unless it is requested by the employee.
If an employee is self-isolating because of symptoms or possible exposure, managers may still be able to discuss scheduling vacation leave for the 2020-21 fiscal year. If the employee does not feel well enough for this discussion, the manager can wait until the employee is ready to return to work. <SEP> The employee is using “Other Leave with Pay,” code 699 because they are sick with COVID-19 or they are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms.

Wearing a face mask works best when combined with other safety measures. Continue to stay at least 6 feet from others, wash your hands often and disinfect frequently touched surfaces. These simple steps can go a long way toward keeping you, your family—and everyone around you—safe.

“Kids can transmit the virus. They are susceptible to it,” said Anne Rimoin, an epidemiology professor at UCLA. “And the rates of hospitalization is going up.”
In Florida, for example, the number of children who had been hospitalized with Covid-19 surged 23% in eight days – from 246 on July 16 to 303 on July 24.
While children are far less likely to die from coronavirus than adults, more studies show kids can contract and spread coronavirus – contrary to claims made by President Donald Trump and Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos:
– A study out of South Korea shows children at least 10 years old can transmit Covid-19 within a household just as much as adults can.
– In the US, a CDC study showed more than half of the children ages 6 to 10 who attended Georgia summer camp in June and got tested for Covid-19 tested positive. 
The study – which examined test results following a camp that more than 600 campers 120 staffers attended – found that 51% of those ages 6 to 10 tested positive; 44% of those ages 11 to 17 tested positive; and 33% of those ages 18 to 21 tested positive.
“This investigation adds to the body of evidence demonstrating that children of all ages are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and, contrary to early reports, might play an important role in transmission,” wrote the CDC study’s authors. <SEP> Is it true that kids aren’t big spreaders of coronavirus? How much do children get Covid-19? <EOS>
Businesses that perform services at scattered sites (such as landscapers, dog walkers, or in-home cleaning companies)
    may submit one Social Distancing Protocol for their whole operation and do not need to complete a new Protocol for
    every place they provide services (for example, every home where a landscaper works). All scattered-site businesses
    must provide a copy of their Protocol to the owner or operator of each place they perform services (in addition to
    providing the Protocol to all workers).
If a scattered-site business has a facility (like a headquarters office or a maintenance yard), the Social Distancing
    Protocol must list that facility address in the “Street Address” field at the top of the Protocol form, and the
    signage required by the Social Distancing Protocol must be posted at the facility. These businesses should not check
    the “No Business Facility” box at the top of the form (because they have a facility, even if some or most of their
    services take place elsewhere).
However, if a scattered-site business does not have a facility of any kind and workers work
    only from scattered sites, these businesses should not fill in the “Street Address” field at the
    top of the Social Distancing Protocol form. Instead, they should click the “No Business Facility” box. These
    businesses will not need to post any signage (because they do not have a facility in which to post it). They should
    still go through the form carefully and check any boxes that apply to their business.
If a business has multiple facilities, however, it must fill out a Social Distancing Protocol form for each location. <SEP> What if my business performs services at many different sites? <EOS>

Currently, there is not enough evidence for or against the use of masks (medical or other) in healthy individuals in the wider community. However, WHO is actively studying the rapidly evolving science on masks and continuously updates its guidance. Medical masks are recommended primarily in health care settings, but can be considered in other circumstances (see below). Medical masks should be combined with other key infection prevention and control measures such as hand hygiene and physical distancing. 
Healthcare workers
Why? Medical masks and respirators such as N95, FFP2 or equivalent are recommended for and should be reserved for, healthcare workers while giving care to patients. Close contact with people with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and their surrounding environment are the main routes of transmission, which means healthcare workers are the most exposed. People who are sick and exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19
Why? Anyone who is sick, with mild symptoms such as muscle aches, slight cough, sore throat or fatigue, should isolate at home and use a medical mask according to WHO’s recommendation on home care of patients with suspected COVID-19. Coughing, sneezing or talking can generate droplets that cause can spread the infection. These droplets can reach the face of others nearby and land on the surrounding environment. If an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks while wearing a medical mask, this can help to protect those nearby from infection.
If a sick person needs to go to a health facility they should wear a medical mask. 
Anyone taking care of a person at home who is sick with COVID-19 
Why? Those caring for individuals who are sick with COVID-19 should wear a medical mask for protection. Again, close, frequent and prolonged contact with someone with COVID-19 puts caretakers at high risk. 
National decision makers may also choose to recommend medical mask use for certain individuals using a risk-based approach. This approach takes into consideration the purpose of the mask, risk of exposure and vulnerability of the wearer, the setting, the feasibility of use and the types of masks to be considered. <SEP> Does WHO recommend wearing medical masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19? <EOS>
We don’t know yet. We don't have research that shows if you have any immunity at all, temporary, or permanent.

It is important to maintain good hygiene practices around open food displays, with ready-to-eat food products such as salad bars, fresh produce displays and bakery products. Consumers should always be advised to wash fruits and vegetables with potable water prior to consumption. Both customers and staff should strictly observe good personal hygiene practices at all times around open food areas.In order to hygienically manage open food displays and to avoid the transmission of COVID-19 through surface contact, food retailers should:Maintain frequent washing and sanitising of all food contact surfaces and utensils;Require food service workers to frequently wash hands, and, if using gloves, these must be changed;Require food service workers to frequently clean and sanitise counters, serving utensils and condiment containers;Make available hand sanitiser for consumers on their way in and out of the food premises;Should consider not openly displaying or selling unwrapped bakery products from self-service counters. Bakery products on open, self-service displays in retail stores should be placed in plastic/cellophane or paper packaging. Where loose bakery products are displayed in retail stores, these should be placed in plexiglass display cabinets and placed in bags using tongs when customers are served.Ready-to-eat salads available in retail for self-serve, should also be placed behind plexiglass display cabinets and serving utensils should be frequently sanitized. <SEP> How should baked goods and fresh produce be displayed in a food market/grocery store? <EOS>

It is frustrating that the shelves are emptying while stockpiling is occurring. However, it will ease once the supply chains have caught up with what is selling most and increase their inventory, allowing for stores to begin restocking, and then the scarcity will begin to subside. Some supplies will return faster than others, depending on how popular the demand remains but stores and suppliers are profit-driven and have an incentive to restock. Try shopping during special shopping hours if you meet their requirements, like being elderly, disabled, etc. If not, go at less popular times like nighttime or order online if this feature is still operating where you are (just beware, doing this won't solve the problem of missing toilet paper and hand sanitizer).

Most sports paused when the pandemic swept through the United States in the spring. Many are back, but are playing to empty stadiums. 
The N.B.A., W.N.B.A. and M.L.S. took one strategy of setting up a “bubble” where all players and staff are living and playing in a restricted, campus-like set of hotels and stadiums. These leagues have had limited positive tests since their seasons have restarted. Major League Baseball, on the other hand, went a different route and didn’t put as many restrictions on their players, and seem to be suffering the consequences. 
The N.F.L, is still pushing to start it’s season this fall. But it’s unclear if they’ll be able to do so successfully. 
As to the future of spectator sports, until there is a widely-used vaccine, esuming in-person spectatorship could be dangerous, both because athletes might unknowingly give the virus to fans, or because an unknowing fan could give the virus to … an entire team. 
That’s frustrating. Fans love sports, and sports love fans. Even the televised spectacle is not what it used to be. <SEP> What's going on with sports? <EOS>
You may report a fatality or in-patient hospitalization using any one of the following:

Call the nearest OSHA office;
Call the OSHA 24-hour hotline at 1-800-321-OSHA (6742); or
By electronic submission, report online.

Be prepared to supply: Business name; name(s) of employee(s) affected; location and time of the incident; brief description of the incident; and contact person and phone number so that OSHA may follow-up with you (unless you wish to make the report anonymously). <SEP> How do I report the fatality or  in-patient hospitalization of an employee with a confirmed, work-related case  of COVID-19? <EOS>
Be polite when asking, and remind her that games can encourage creativity. For example, Prodigy helps children learn their math skills, just remember to limit your screen time so your mom will regret her decision. <SEP> But what if I'm a kid and I'm trying to convince my mom to let me play Minecraft or Prodigy but she says I have to be productive? How can i convince her? <EOS>
Experience from previous disease outbreaks has shown the disruptive effect on health service delivery and the consequences for diseases such as malaria. The 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, for example, undermined malaria control efforts and led to a massive increase in malaria-related illness and death in the 3 countries.A modelling analysis from WHO and partners, published on 23 April, found that the number of malaria deaths in sub-Saharan Africa could double this year alone if there are severe disruptions in access to insecticide-treated nets and antimalarial medicines due to COVID-19. These projections reinforce the critical importance of sustaining efforts to prevent, detect and treat malaria during the pandemic.In all regions, protective measures should be utilized to minimize the risk of COVID-19 transmission between patients, communities and health providers. WHO and partners have developed guidance on how to safely maintain malaria prevention and treatment services in COVID-19 settings. <SEP> Why is WHO particularly concerned about the spread of COVID-19 in malaria-affected areas? <EOS>
There is no evidence that any of the animals or animal products authorised for entry into the European Union pose a risk to the health of EU citizens as a result of the presence of COVID-19. <SEP> 1.

If testing in the private sector is not available, clinicians may request testing for patients at DCLS by contacting the local health department.
Testing is available through Virginia’s state public health lab, the Division of Consolidated Laboratory Services (DCLS), for people who meet the high priority and priority testing criteria, found here (criteria revised 6/4/2020).
VDH Recommendations for prioritizing SARS-CoV-2 testing



 

Private/Commercial Lab Testing


Public Health Lab Testing




High Priority



Hospitalized patients*
Healthcare workers and first responders with COVID-19 symptoms*
Un- or underinsured persons with COVID-19 symptoms*
Residents and workers with COVID-19 symptoms* in, or newly arriving to, congregate settings (e.g., long-term care facilities, prisons, jails, or behavioral health facilities)




Contact and outbreak investigations
Residents and workers with COVID-19 symptoms* in, or newly arriving to, congregate settings (e.g., long-term care facilities, prisons, jails, or behavioral health facilities)
Un- or underinsured persons with COVID-19 symptoms*





Priority



Persons with COVID-19 symptoms*
Persons without symptoms who are

Close contacts of cases**
Prioritized by clinicians based on their best clinical judgment (e.g. for medical procedures)






Public health monitoring, including point prevalence surveys
Sentinel surveillance and seroprevalence studies
Community testing clinics





*Description of symptoms associated with COVID-19. Atypical presentations have been described, and older adults and persons with medical comorbidities may have delayed presentation of fever and respiratory symptoms.
**Close contact is defined as being within 6 feet of a person with COVID-19 for at least 15 minutes or having exposure to the person’s respiratory secretions (for example, being coughed or sneezed on; sharing a drinking glass or utensils; kissing) while they were contagious. A person with COVID-19 is considered to be contagious starting from 2 days before they became sick (or 2 days before they tested positive if they never had symptoms) until they meet the criteria to discontinue isolation. <SEP> Can I get tested through Virginia’s state public health lab? <EOS>
We use several systems, including the state’s notifiable conditions database – the Washington Disease Reporting System (WDRS). It alerts public health agencies to a positive COVID-19 test result. All of the systems we use for this work are secure and use multi-factor authentication. <SEP> Which systems do you use to collect and store data? <EOS>
Yes. You may also  need a death certificate to ship remains to a different country.
You can request a  NYC death certificate online at vitalchek.com or by mailing a copy  of the certificate application. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in-person  ordering of NYC death certificates is suspended until further notice. <SEP> Do I need to get a death certificate to hold a funeral? <EOS>
Patients can be discharged from the healthcare facility whenever clinically indicated. Meeting criteria for discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions is not a prerequisite for discharge from a healthcare facility. Isolation should be maintained at home if the patient returns home before the time period recommended for discontinuation of hospital Transmission-Based Precautions.
Decisions to discontinue Transmission-Based Precautions or in-home isolation should be made according to the following guidance:

For hospitalized persons, see Discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions and Disposition of Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Healthcare Settings.
For non-hospitalized persons, see Interim Guidance for Implementing Home Care of People Not Requiring Hospitalization for COVID-19 and Discontinuation of Isolation for Persons with COVID-19 Not in Healthcare Settings. <SEP> When can patients with confirmed COVID-19 be discharged from the hospital? <EOS>
CDC does not have a limit or recommend a specific number of attendees for these types of events and instead encourages event organizers to focus on ways to limit people’s contact with each other. Each event organizer will need to determine the appropriate number for their setting in collaboration with local health officials. They should also check state, county, and city rules regarding any current restrictions limiting the number of attendees at events.
In general, the number that is chosen should allow individuals to remain at least 6 feet apart from each other. Rather than focusing on an ideal number, event organizers and administrators should focus on the ability to reduce and limit contact between attendees, staff, and others. In general, the more people you interact with, the more closely you interact with them, and the longer that interaction, the higher your risk of getting and spreading COVID-19. Indoor spaces are more risky than outdoor spaces because indoors, it can be harder to keep people at least 6 feet apart and the ventilation is not as good as it is outdoors. <SEP> How many guests can safely attend a conference, sporting event, concert, or other community event? <EOS>
All open retail businesses must:
Limit customers inside the store to Emergency Maximum Occupancy.
Mark 6 feet of spacing in lines at point of sale and in other high-traffic areas for customers, such as at deli counters and near high-demand products.
Post the Emergency Maximum Occupancy in a noticeable place.
Post signs reminding customers and workers about social distancing and requesting that people who have been sick with a fever and/or cough not enter.
Conduct daily symptom screening of workers, using a standard interview questionnaire of symptoms, before workers enter the workplace.
Immediately isolate and remove sick workers.
Perform frequent and routine environmental cleaning and disinfection of high-touch areas with an EPA-approved disinfectant for SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
The N.C. Department of Health and Human Services has prepared sample signs and a sample screening checklist questionnaire that may be used to meet some of the requirements above. Businesses or operations do not need to use the NCDHHS sample signs and questionnaires to meet the requirements of this Executive Order. <SEP> What requirements do open retail businesses need to follow? <EOS>
The COVID-19 test is free. The COVID-19 Test should only be done when your provider thinks your symptoms show likely infection.
Effective March 18, under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, TRICARE is also waiving copays for doctor-ordered COVID 19 testing office visits.
    
The law doesn't waive copayments and cost-shares for the treatment due to infection. Copays and cost shares remain the same for TRICARE program and plans.
Under TRICARE you have fairly low out-of-pocket costs, a catastrophic cap and protection against balance billing.


Active duty service members and ADFMs under Prime do not have cost-shares and so are not impacted by this law.
Due to the claims billing process and modifications, TRICARE can't immediately waive all copayments and cost-shares. Beneficiaries may have to pay up front and file a claims for reimbursement until the contractors can modify their systems.
If you receive a prescription for medication, your copay still applies. By law, TRICARE can't waive pharmacy copays. Consider filling your medication through home delivery or at a retail pharmacy depending on your MTFs operating status.

If you’re located overseas: Beneficiaries overseas with a cost-shareA percentage of the total cost of a covered health care service that you pay. (retirees and their family members, active duty family members (ADFMs) under TRICARE Select, and TRICARE For Life) may be eligible for cost share waivers. This is only if the COVID-19 test with the visit meets the requirements of the law. It has to be FDA approved, cleared, or authorized. Some tests used and TRICARE-covered overseas may not meet this statutory requirement. This includes the World Health Organization test, which is not currently FDA authorized. <SEP> How much does the test cost? <EOS>
CDC does not have a limit or specific number for these scenarios. Each sports administrator or program will need to determine the appropriate number for their setting in collaboration with local health officials. In general, the number that is chosen should allow individuals to remain at least 6 feet apart from each other. Rather than focusing on an ideal number, emphasis should be placed on the ability to reduce and limit contact between players, spectators, and others. For additional tips, CDC has developed resources for events and gatherings.

​If your business is still operating but you are unable to work due to COVID-19, talk to your employer about use of paid leave vs. filing for UC.Most paid leave will provide 100 percent of your usual pay, while unemployment benefits typically pay between 50 to 70 percent, depending on your circumstances. Paid leave may be available immediately and allow you to keep receiving a paycheck; it typically takes two to four weeks to receive UC benefits.You may file a UC claim if you know you will exhaust your paid leave. You must report all income received from any source, including paid leave.  Learn more about financial eligibility here. <SEP> ​Am I eligible for UC if I have paid leave? <EOS>
A surgical mask, or facemask, is meant to protect the surrounding environment from your respiratory issues. In contrast, a respirator protects you from anything in the environment. A respirator is thicker and fits more tightly than the facemasks you might be familiar with, ubiquitous in China and other Asian countries. <SEP> What's the difference between a respirator and a surgical mask? <EOS>
Excessive media consumption is a concern, and frequent updates and news out of city hall can contribute to the problem. This is one reason why a regular and predictable time of day or day of the week for bundling and releasing information is so important. You’re trying to take some of the cognitive burden off people by creating a superstructure that's predictable and reliable so that they can seek information at particular times and know that those updates will be there. (Dr. Kim Leary, 4/9/20) <SEP> How can we create some sense of order and predictability for people when we are adapting continuously and announcing policy changes so frequently? <EOS>
Governor Murphy's briefings and press conferences related to the State's response to the COVID-19 pandemic are livestreamed via the Governor's YouTube channel. <SEP> Where can I watch the Governor’s briefings on COVID-19 / Novel Coronavirus? <EOS>
WHO regularly issues scientific briefs to explain topics in depth for a scientific audience. The brief on COVID-19 transmission summarizes what is known about how the virus spreads between people, who can transmit the virus and when people pass the infection from one to another, and the implications for preventive measures to be adopted. It also outlines some key areas where more research is needed and how these results will help inform advice and guidance.  This information is important for understanding how best to prevent infection and limit the spread of the virus between people.  WHO scientific briefs are living documents, meaning they are updated as more studies become available. COVID-19 is a new disease and we are learning more every day. <SEP> What is the purpose of a scientific brief on transmission? <EOS>
Violence against women is highly prevalent, and intimate partner violence is the most common form of violence. During health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, violence against women tends to increase.  Whilst data are scarce, reports from across the world, including China, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, and other countries suggest a significant increase in domestic violence cases related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Reports from other countries suggest a reduction in survivors seeking services due to a combination of lockdown measures and not wanting to attend health services for fear of infection. <SEP> Has violence against women increased since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic? <EOS>
At this time, it appears that COVID-19 is spread primarily through respiratory droplets (meaning moisture that comes from coughing, sneezing, or talking). These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another. Close contact includes: being within 6 feet of someone who has COVID-19 for at least 15 minutes; provided care at home to someone who is sick with COVID-19; direct physical contact with someone who has COVID-19 (touched, hugged, or kissed them); shared eating or drinking utensils with someone that has COVID-19; sneezed, coughed, or somehow got respiratory droplets on you from someone who has COVID-19.
Although most spread involves sick people passing infectious droplets, some people don't ever have symptoms (asymptomatic people). The virus that causes COVID-19 can spread from infected people who do not have any symptoms. Because this type of spread is possible, it is very important for everyone to follow recommendations for physical distancing, hand washing and face coverings, even if they do not feel sick. <SEP> How is it spread? <EOS>
We recognize that there will be stress and anxiety related to returning to the workplace. Remember, the return will be gradual and done respecting all public health measures. If you must be on site as business resumes, rest assured that all public health advisories and measures are being implemented. In the meantime, if you are able to perform your duties from home, you are encouraged to explore this option with your manager. You may also be able to take Leave 699 and we encourage you to discuss your personal situation with your manager to determine the best solution for you and your family.
If you need to talk to someone for assistance coping with the stress and anxiety of the situation, there are a number of tools and resources available for you on HRGo or through HRConnect. <SEP> If all daycares and summer camps are open, do I need to go back to work as I'm scared for my kids and feel safer watching them as I know they are safe.

Businesses should consider how they would deal with a customer who may attempt to enter the business without a shirt or shoes, and may wish to react similarly. Businesses should consider giving customers resources on how to make their own mask or provide a mask.
Additionally, businesses should advise customers that masks are required while in the business; tell the customer that only persons who cannot wear a mask due to a medical condition do not have to comply with the requirement to wear a mask; and advise the customer that almost any face covering would be acceptable. If a customer is belligerent or aggressive, employees need not force a customer to comply and should not put themselves in a dangerous situation. <SEP> How do businesses avoid confrontation with customers who do not wear a mask? <EOS>
  There are no AHCCCS billing codes to cover the cost of purchasing PPE. However, some health care plans are offering enhanced provider payments and supplying PPE to providers in need. Some provider associations are also able to offer PPE. If you are in need of PPE see FAQ #4 under Provider Enrollment & Requirements. <SEP>  Can providers bill Medicaid for personal protective equipment (PPE)? <EOS>

 The FDA encourages health care providers to report any adverse events or suspected adverse events experienced with medical gloves.
Voluntary reports can be submitted through MedWatch, the FDA Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting program.
Device manufacturers and user organizations must comply with the applicable Medical Device Reporting (MDR) regulations.
Health care personnel employed by organizations that are subject to the FDA's user facility reporting requirements should follow the reporting procedures established by their organizations. <SEP>  How do I report a problem with medical gloves? <EOS>
Workers are entitled to working conditions that do not pose a risk of  serious harm. What this means varies from job to job. Federal standards and directives that may apply to worker exposure to COVID-19  can be found on the Occupational Safety and Health  Administration (OSHA) COVID-19 webpage. 
The COVID-19 best  practices for business and non-healthcare settings as well as cleaning and  disinfection guidance can be found under the Business  and Other Facilities page of nyc.gov/coronavirus. The CDC  has also provided guidance on best practices, and OSHA has published a guide for  preparing workplaces for COVID-19. 
The NYC Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) created a  summary of City labor laws for employers and employees as you deal with the  impact of COVID-19 on your workplace. These include the Paid Safe and Sick  Leave Law, Fair Workweek Laws for fast food and retail workers, and the  Freelance Isn't Free Act. Visit the DCWP website to download the summary in your preferred language. These City workplace laws  apply to workers regardless of immigration status.
The City issued social distancing guidance to stores to protect essential  workers. Stores should require customers to wear face coverings to protect  employees and customers, and business owners should post signs to help enforce  this guidance. Employers should call 311 or visit nyc.gov/coronavirus for updates. 
The Mayor recently announced that all essential workers employed by the  New York City would receive face coverings and would be required to wear face  coverings while interacting with others. City agencies are submitting requests  for their employees. City workers who have questions should reach out to their  agency. <SEP> What are my rights  as a worker during the COVID-19 crisis? <EOS>
Being indoors, such as a classroom or hospital waiting room, with a sick person with COVID-19 and remaining more than 6 feet away, does not put you at a higher risk of getting sick. Additionally, briefly walking by or being briefly in the same room as a sick person with COVID-19 does not put you at a higher risk of getting sick. <SEP> Can I be in the same room with someone who has COVID-19 and not get it? <EOS>
In public-facing facilities, the mass gathering limit applies per each room of the facility. <SEP> Regarding indoor spaces that are public facing, is the mass gathering limit calculated by the entire building or per room? <EOS>
​No. If you are offered work by your employer and refuse to accept it, even if it is at reduced hours, and your acceptance is without good cause, you may no longer be eligible for UC. Determining whether there was good cause for a refusal of work is driven by the facts of each claimant's circumstances.  During the current COVID-19 pandemic, examples of good cause may include:  an employer violates the Governor's and Secretary of Health's business closure orders and opens their business prematurely, or the person is at high risk of complications from the virus and their employer cannot make reasonable accommodations for them.  UC staff would review those specific reasons and make determinations based on the facts of their individual cases.If you do return to work at reduced hours, and this results in a reduced weekly income compared to your weekly income prior to filing for UC, you may be eligible for partial UC plus the $600 FPUC per week. <SEP> ​My employer offered me my job back but at reduced hours.  I would make more staying on unemployment.  Can I do this? <EOS>
If your child runs away from home, immediately report them missing to the police. Tell the police what your child's name is, their age, their height, their weight and the last time you have seen them, It is dangerous for a child to run away from home. <SEP> What if my child runs away? <EOS>
No. COVID-19 is the name of the disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. No disinfectant can kill or treat a disease.
Regarding SARS-CoV-2, businesses typically violate state and federal laws if they make pesticidal claims not present on the product’s label. When pesticides are registered with the EPA, label claims are reviewed with supporting data to verify claims are legitimate. With SARS-CoV-2 as a new viral pathogen, labels do not yet specify the ability to kill SARS-CoV-2.  If the product is found on EPA’s List N, it can be used for disinfection against SARS-CoV-2. Updated labels or manufacturer websites might have one of the following claims for List N disinfectants, which firms can also utilize:
a) [Product name] has demonstrated effectiveness against viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 on hard, [porous and/or non-porous surfaces]. Therefore, [product name] can be used against SARS-CoV-2 when used in accordance with the directions for use against [name of supporting virus(es)] on [hard, porous/non-porous surfaces]. Refer to the [CDC or OIE] website at [pathogen-specific website address] for additional information.
b) COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2. [Product name] kills similar viruses and therefore can be used against SARS-CoV-2 when used in accordance with the directions for use against [name of supporting virus(es)] on [hard, porous/non-porous surfaces]. Refer to the [CDC or OIE] website at [website address] for additional information.
For additional information, visit the EPA website. <SEP> Can I claim the disinfectant I use kills COVID-19? <EOS>
 The Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) reports hospitalization data daily at 3 p.m. This information is from the Alabama Incident Management System (AIMS). Information related to persons on ventilators or in ICU changes as some patients are removed from ventilators or ICU in one facility while patients in other facilities are being placed on ventilators or in ICU. Since the beginning of the pandemic, a review of data indicates that about 13% of persons require ventilatory support at some time in hospitalization, as well as about 25-30% of person requiring ICU support during some portion of their hospitalization. Cumulative totals for hospitalization, patients in ICU, and patients on ventilators can be found on our COVID-19 Data and Surveillance Dashboard. <SEP>  What are the current numbers of hospitalizations, patients in ICU, and patients on ventilators in Alabama hospitals? <EOS>
As stated in Section IV.D of the FDA's Policy for Coronavirus Disease-2019 Tests, the FDA does not intend to object to a commercial manufacturer's development and distribution of serology tests to identify antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 for a reasonable period of time, where the test has been validated and while the manufacturer is preparing its EUA request, where the manufacturer gives notification to the FDA and information that helps users and patients understand the test results, such as the following, is included in the instructions for use:
This test has not been reviewed by the FDA.
Negative results do not preclude acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. If acute infection is suspected, direct testing for SARS-CoV-2 is necessary.
Results from antibody testing should not be used to diagnose or exclude acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Positive results may be due to past or present infection with non-SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus strains, such as coronavirus HKU1, NL63, OC43, or 229E.
As noted in the guidance, the FDA believes that 10 business days is a reasonable period of time to prepare an EUA submission for such tests. Unless and until an EUA is issued that authorizes additional testing environments for a specific test, under CLIA, use of that test is limited to laboratories certified to perform high complexity testing, and at the point-of-care when covered by the laboratory's CLIA certificate for high-complexity testing.
This policy does not apply to at-home testing, including at-home specimen collection.
The commercial manufacturers in the list below have notified the FDA that they have validated and intend to distribute a serology test as set forth in Section IV.D of the Policy for Coronavirus Disease-2019 Tests. Where the Authorization Status is "FDA Authorized," the FDA reviewed and issued an EUA for the test after notification was given. Where the Authorization Status is shown as "Not FDA Authorized," the FDA has not yet reviewed the manufacturer's validation and issued an EUA for the manufacturer's test, and the test is included in this list to provide transparency regarding the notification submitted to the FDA. The "Setting for Use" designation of "H" refers to a laboratory certified under CLIA to perform high-complexity testing. Certain developers have completed the EUA process prior to offering a test for clinical use rather than notify FDA under this policy. Tests that have been issued an EUA can be found on the EUA page.
If an EUA request is not submitted within a reasonable period of time, or if significant problems are identified with a test and cannot be or have not been addressed in a timely manner, FDA intends to remove the manufacturer and test from this list, would expect the manufacturer to suspend distribution of the test, and may take additional actions as appropriate.
Manufacturers that have notified FDA that they have validated and intend to distribute serology tests as set forth in Section IV.D:

Investigators will not randomize further patients to hydroxychloroquine in the Solidarity trial. Patients who have already started hydroxychloroquine but who have not yet finished their course in the trial may complete their course or stop at the discretion of the supervising physician. The use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are accepted as generally safe for use in patients with autoimmune diseases or malaria. <SEP> What will happen to the people who were already enrolled in the hydroxychloroquine arm of the trial? <EOS>
Many communities of faith have provided guidance on how to practice faith in times when public gatherings would put the community at risk. Additionally, virtual/online services are being held for many communities of faith to allow people to worship without having to gather in-person. Under Virginia’s Plan for Reopening (Safer at Home), religious services may occur with extra precautions in place to protect people from COVID-19 transmission. Some communities may not be ready to take these steps and may have stricter control measures in place. When in-person services are not available, we can worship and pray in our homes. But we do not have to do it alone. Through televised services, video chat, and coordinated prayer times, we can worship together, even from a distance. <SEP> How can I practice my faith if I can’t go to my place of worship in person? <EOS>
Reported illnesses have ranged from mild symptoms to severe illness and death for confirmed COVID-19 cases. The following symptoms of COVID-19 may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus:



Fever or chills
Cough
Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
Fatigue
Muscle or body aches
Headache
New loss of taste or smell
Sore throat
Congestion or runny nose
Nausea or vomiting
Diarrhea



The symptoms of COVID-19 can vary a bit from person to person. Some people with COVID-19 infection have no symptoms (also known as asymptomatic). Children generally experience similar signs and symptoms of illness as adults.  For additional information, see Children and COVID-19.
Virginians can use COVIDCheck, an online risk-assessment tool to check their symptoms and connect with appropriate health care resources, including COVID-19 testing. Visit VDH’s web page for more information on what to do if you feel sick.
For more information on symptoms of COVID-19, visit the CDC’s webpage: Symptoms of Coronavirus. <SEP> What are the symptoms? <EOS>
When symptoms go away, the fever is gone, and an individual is feeling better, that person can still test positive for COVID-19 via a diagnostic (PCR) test. But that’s not because they’re contagious, it’s because virus remnants can continue to show up in tests for weeks. <SEP> What happens after a person tests positive for COVID, gets sick, and then gets better? Are they still considered "positive?" <EOS>
Military pharmacies may change a number of services to keep you safe during this COVID-19 period.  Leadership evaluates the pharmacy’s status on an ongoing basis. They look at the installation, pharmacy services, and other local conditions. 
Changes in operations to military pharmacies may include:

Decreasing the number of people in the waiting area 
Setting up different times for you to drop off prescriptions and pick them up 
Setting up other places for you to pick up your drugs
Changing the hours and days they are open
Limiting who they serve (e.g. Active Duty only). This is on a temporary basis.
Closing the pharmacy.  This is on a temporary basis.

Social distancing and safety protocols may also vary by location.  This may include: 

Limiting the number of people in the pharmacy waiting area
Using signs, e.g. setting up a six foot distance between people 
Setting up physical barriers, e.g. Plexiglas in pharmacy windows
Using touchless ID card scanning
Set up prescription pick-up services where people don’t make direct contact with each other.

Some military pharmacies offered drive through or curbside services by borrowing staff from other specialtiesA branch of medicine or surgery that a doctor specializes in., such as dentistry. We’ll likely won’t be able to continue to offer these options for several reasons.  For example: support staff have to return to their normal duties; prescription volume will increase as routine visits and elective procedures restart.
Call your military pharmacy refill call-in line for MTF pharmacy information.  You can search for the pharmacy phone number at tricare.mil/mtf. <SEP> Can I get my medications from a military pharmacy? <EOS>
We don't know for sure. If you’re increasing testing, you'll find more positives, but that may not be the only factor. Cases are also increasing because the virus is spreading. The most important thing right now is to watch the healthcare system. If more patients are coming in and they are getting sicker, then you know that the situation is getting worse, regardless of the number of tests. We are seeing such increases in New York. Mayors should keep in touch with their hospitals to understand the status of the pandemic on healthcare systems. (Dr. Josh Sharfstein, 4/4/20) <SEP> Is the current spike in cases a result of increased testing or because the virus is still spreading? When can we expect to see the curve flatten? <EOS>
Depending on the steps facilities are taking and the length of stay, people released from a facility may have had screenings for COVID-19 symptoms, temperature checks, or even a test—a pre-release planning process. The family member or friend may have also been offered information and resources on how to prevent COVID-19. If they were sick at the time of release, they may have been linked to community resources to make sure they follow proper medical isolation and have access to medical care.
There are things that family members and people who share housing can do to promote a healthy home and prevent getting sick. You’re encouraged to find a room where the person can stay alone for at least 14 days and monitor their symptoms. During that time, they should limit contact with others within and outside the home, particularly people who are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 like older adults and those with underlying medical conditions. They should avoid providing care for children during this time, if possible. Friends and family should keep a distance of at least 6 feet, and everyone should consider wearing a cloth face covering, especially when going out in public. Finally, frequent handwashing, as well as cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces, are also important.
Additional information is available regarding the prevention of COVID-19 for people who share a small apartment  or live in a household with large or extended families. If the person who was just released, or anyone in your household, develops symptoms or tests positive for COVID-19, please follow CDC recommendations for what to do if you become sick or have to care for someone who is sick. <SEP> If a family member or friend is returning home soon (during the COVID-19 pandemic) from a correctional or detention facility, how should a household prepare to receive them and maintain everyone’s safety? <EOS>
You can meet in groups of up to six people who you do not live with or who are not in your support bubble.
You can also meet people in groups of more than six people if everyone is exclusively from two households (anyone in the same support bubble counts as one household).
There is more information about the guidelines you should follow when meeting people you do not live with here. <SEP> 2.2 How many people am I allowed to meet with outdoors? <EOS>
The virus that causes COVID-19 does appear to spread from people to pets, according to the FDA. Research has found that cats and ferrets are more likely to become infected than dogs.If you have a pet, do the following to reduce their risk of infection:
Avoid letting pets interact with people or animals that do not live in your household.
Keep cats indoors when possible to prevent them from interacting with other animals or people.
Walk dogs on a leash maintaining at least six feet from other people and animals.
Avoid dog parks or public places where a large number of people and dogs gather.
If you become sick with COVID-19, restrict contact with your pets, just like you would around other people. This means you should forgo petting, snuggling, being kissed or licked, and sharing food or bedding with your pet until you are feeling better. When possible, have another member of your household care for your pets while you are sick. If you must care for your pet while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with your pets and wear a face mask.At present, it is considered unlikely that pets can spread the COVID-19 virus to humans. However, pets can spread other infections that cause illness, including E. coli and Salmonella, so wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water after interacting with your animal companions. <SEP> Can people infect pets with the COVID-19 virus? <EOS>
As of June 1, 2020 Delawareans are no longer under stay-at-home orders. We all still need to continue to take precautions like staying at least 6 feet apart from others, wear a face covering, and:

Wash your hands frequently and thoroughly with soap and hot water. If you do not have access to soap and water, use hand sanitizer until you can wash your hands.
Avoid touching your face or mouth with unwashed hands.
Sneeze or cough into your elbow, and if you use a tissue, throw it away immediately.
If you are sick, stay isolate from others in your household.
Check the “What You Can Do” section of this website for updates. <SEP> How do I keep myself and my family safe? <EOS>
Businesses are required to make employees and customers aware of the guidance provided by the Commonwealth to keep people at their establishment safe. In addition, businesses are required to publicly acknowledge their responsibility to conduct their operations to ensure the health.
Businesses must print, sign, and post the “COVID-19 Safety Procedures for Businesses” flyer on their premises. The flyer is located on the Resources for COVID-19 webpage. Businesses must post the signed flyer in employee common space and, if the business serves the public, the business must also post the flyer near the business’s public entrance(s) in prominent location(s). <SEP> Is there any plan to get information about safety requirements to employees so they can ask their employer to take the necessary steps to protect them? <EOS>
 APHIS is continuing to conduct regular inspections where local area and individual premises conditions allow our inspectors to maintain social distancing norms. APHIS will always place the highest priority on investigating reports of extreme Animal Welfare Act violations that could lead to the confiscation of animals. However, if a State or locality has issued a shelter-in-place order like San Francisco, inspectors will honor that order and not conduct inspections in that area at this time. <SEP>  Is APHIS still conducting Animal Welfare Act inspections? <EOS>
A worker may temporarily remove their face covering while working alone in a cubicle if:

The cubicle has 4 walls (one with an opening for an entryway) that are high enough to block the breathing zone, meaning they are above face level, of the person working in the cubicle or any adjoining cubicle;
The work activity will not require anyone to enter the cubicle; and
The worker is at least 6 feet from any other workers in adjoining cubicles. 

If a cubicle does not meet these requirements, the worker may not remove their mask.  If the cubicle meets these requirements the worker may temporarily remove their mask while seated in their cubicle, the worker must replace their face covering:

If a person approaches or enters the cubicle; or
Before standing and leaving the cubicle. <SEP> When may a  worker temporarily remove their face covering while working in a cubicle? <EOS>
Facilities should ensure that incarcerated individuals receive medical evaluation and treatment at the first sign of COVID-19 symptoms. Staff evaluating and providing care for confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases should follow the CDC Interim Clinical Guidance for Management of Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) and monitor the guidance website regularly for updates to these recommendations. Facilities without on-site healthcare staff should contact their state, local, tribal, and/or territorial health department to coordinate effective medical isolation and necessary medical care. Facilities should have a plan in place to safely transfer persons with complications from COVID-19 to a local hospital if they require care beyond what the facility is able to provide. When evaluating and treating persons with symptoms of COVID-19 who do not speak English, provide a translator when possible. Spanish and Simplified Chinese materials are available for those who need them. <SEP> What do medical staff need to know about caring for a person with COVID-19 in my facility? <EOS>
Yes, because a family member may suddenly have to quarantine. Just don’t hoard more than you need because other people need supplies, too. 
Harvard Medical School recommends keeping a two-week to 30-day supply of nonperishable food at home. And if you don’t use them now, they may come in handy for power outages or extreme weather. 
It’s also a good idea to keep at least a 30-day supply of prescription medications you may need, though it can be difficult to get them early. Consider mail-ordering medications. <SEP> Should I stock up on extra food and supplies? <EOS>
The Virginia Department of Health is encouraging students and their families to prepare for the upcoming school year.  Many students will need updated immunizations, physicals for enrollment, medication administration, documentation for health conditions and emergency action plans for chronic conditions (asthma, allergy, diabetes and seizures). Please contact your health care provider to discuss your child’s medical needs for the upcoming school year. <SEP> I need to provide my child’s school with documentation from our healthcare provider in order for my child to return to school for the 2020-2021 school year. Should I take my child to their healthcare provider during this time of COVID-19? <EOS>
Specific measures to observe in school settings are increased physical distancing, improved ventilation, regular hand-washing, and the use of masks when feasible. These measures will probably reduce transmission of the virus in schools and help to mitigate the impact of other respiratory infections during the upcoming autumn and winter season, thereby reducing pressure on schools and healthcare facilities.Check with your national health and education authorities for more information. <SEP> 2. When and how will schools be reopened? What are the most important measures for preventing the spread of infection in schools? <EOS>
Kids with autism who feel frustrated, worried, or scared may have more repetitive
               behaviors (like hand flapping or rocking), tantrums, and other challenging behaviors.
Find ways for your child to express feelings. To help kids work through strong
               emotions, try:

talking together
doing crafts
writing
playing or acting out fears
for kids who are nonverbal, using augmented (or alternative) communication devices

Also try calming activities, such
               as deep breathing, music, or watching a favorite video throughout the day. Exercise

It depends upon whether your work is deemed essential or not and your medical risk.  If you are in a population particularly susceptible to COVID-19 and are directed by a medical professional or government official to quarantine or self-isolate, you may be eligible for UC.  If you or your employer is unsure of your risk to COVID-19, the PA Department of Health has created a "risk assessment tool" to help businesses make decisions about operations and employee and customer safety during the COVID-19 outbreak. <SEP> ​If I have concerns about my health, do I have to report to work? <EOS>
Our health care system at its baseline is confusing and scattered. When you're building testing on top of that, you get a scattered system for testing. It is the job of public health officials and mayors to try to make that more coherent. Where should people go? How can they get there? How do they access the system?
Unfortunately, nobody really knows whether testing needs are being met. If a mayor were to say, “I'm going to ask 10 people in the city to try to get tested today and rank how easy it was,” you’d have some of the only data that exists about that question. Similarly, a mayor could survey nursing homes and ask, “Can you get the testing you need for people who are sick?” then, if the answer is no, turn around and say to the state, "My nursing homes can't get the testing that they need.” That would have an effect, because people just don't know where the gaps and bottlenecks are. (Dr. Josh Sharfstein, 5/29/20)
Sometimes, decentralization and fragmentation can be an advantage because they allow us to do different things in different places and to respond effectively to a heterogeneous problem. That is not the case with tracing and tracking down contacts, which is a very precise endeavor that requires trying to get people tested as quickly and consistently as possible to break the spread of the virus.
For testing and contact tracing, command, control, and centralization are really important to try to get all this information collected and collated in a credible place, and to make sure that everybody's reading from the same database.

Governor Murphy signed Executive Order No. 121, allowing an increase in the maximum weight limit on certain interstate highways and toll roads from 80,000 pounds (40 tons) tons to 92,000 pounds (46 tons) for vehicles transporting COVID-19 relief supplies.
The Order allows vehicles carrying COVID-19 relief supplies to obtain special permits issued by the Department of Transportation in order to operate on certain state highways and toll roads at a weight limit of up to 92,000 pounds.
The increased weight tolerance only applies to interstate highways within New Jersey, the New Jersey Turnpike, the Garden State Parkway from Exit 105 Southbound, and the Atlantic City Expressway.
It does not apply to I-78 Eastbound and Westbound bridges at Milepost 8.71 over Norfolk Southern Railroad in Hunterdon County, I-80 Ramp D (Landing Rd SB to I-80 EB) at Milepost 28.91 over Landing Road Northbound in Morris County, and north of Exit 105 on the Garden State Parkway.

CDC recommends using authorized nucleic acid or antigen detection assays that have received an FDA EUA to test persons in the following scenarios:

Persons with signs or symptoms consistent with COVID-19
Asymptomatic persons with recent known or suspected exposure to SARS-CoV-2
Asymptomatic persons without known or suspected exposure to SARS-CoV-2 for early identification in special settings (e.g., nursing homes, long-term care facilities, correctional and detention facilities, high-density critical infrastructure workplaces, etc.)
Individuals being tested for purpose of public health surveillance for SARS-Cov-2
Individuals being tested to determine resolution of infection (e.g., to allow someone to discontinue home isolation, to allow healthcare personnel to return to work, etc.)

Except for rare situations, a test-based strategy is no longer recommended to determine when an individual with SARS-CoV-2 infection is no longer infectious (e.g., to discontinue Transmission-Based Precautions or home isolation)

This popular conspiracy has gained traction among people who don't understand radiation. "Bad" radiation has a very tiny wavelength, enough to disrupt molecule bonds or break electrons free.

(Think of it like the difference between gently rocking a baby to sleep versus shaking a baby at high speeds: one is safe and the other is definitely not.) The 5G radiation is a mellow 30-300 gigahertz, which is in between your typical radio and your typical microwave. Viruses are tiny parasites that multiply inside a host.

Cloth face coverings are not considered personal protective equipment (PPE) and are not intended to be used  when workers need PPE for protection against exposure to occupational hazards. As such, OSHA's PPE standards do not require employers to provide them.

The General Duty Clause, Section 5(a)(1) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, requires each employer to furnish to each of his employees employment and a place of employment which are free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm. Control measures may include a combination of engineering and administrative controls, safe work practices like social distancing, and PPE. 
However, employers may choose to ensure that cloth face coverings are worn as a feasible means of abatement in a control plan designed to address hazards from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Employers may choose to use cloth face coverings as a means of  source control, such as because of transmission risk that cannot be controlled through engineering or administrative controls, including social distancing. <SEP> Are employers required to provide cloth face coverings to workers? <EOS>

For a virus, sanitizers work by disrupting the virus's outer coat, including the novel coronavirus. For bacteria , they work by disrupting its cell membrane. According to the CDC, hand sanitizers are effective when they contain at least 60 percent rubbing alcohol. However, they are not effective against viruses that do not have these coatings, like the norovirus, which causes the stomach flu. This is why proper hand washing habits are more important than relying on just hand sanitizer. Hand-washing for at least 20 seconds is overall the most effective way to get rid of viruses.

All personnel should be encouraged to self-monitor for symptoms before they come to work. Workers who have symptoms of COVID-19 should immediately notify their supervisor and safety officer and self-isolate. They can also enter their symptoms into the CDC Coronavirus Self-Checker to determine whether they need to seek medical care.
Wildfire agencies should ensure that sick leave policies are flexible and consistent with public health guidance, and that employees are aware of and understand these policies.
Wildfire agencies should consider implementing daily temperature checks and symptom screening, consistent with the White House guideline for Opening Up America Againexternal icon. Consider a program for screening workers before entry into the workplace or fire incident, based on CDC guidance for screening employees for COVID-19, which includes:

Verbal screening (from a distance of at least 6 feet) to determine if workers have had symptoms of COVID-19 within the past 24 hours.
Checking temperatures of workers at the start of each shift to identify anyone with a fever of 100.4℉ or greater.

Ensure that screeners are trained to use temperature monitors.
Make sure that temperature monitors are accurate under conditions of use (such as cold or hot temperatures).
Avoid direct sunlight when recording temperatures.


Preventing employees from entering the workplace if they have a fever of 100.4℉ or greater, or if verbal screening results indicate that the worker may have COVID-19.

Encourage workers to self-isolate and contact a healthcare provider.
Provide information on the agency’s return-to-work policies and procedures which may be informed by CDC’s Discontinuation of Isolation for Persons with COVID-19 Not in Healthcare Settings interim guidance.
Inform the employer health unit (if in place), incident medical unit, and supervisor so the worker can return home and self-isolate.



Ensure that personnel performing screening activities, including temperature checks, are appropriately protected from exposure to potentially infectious workers.

Implement engineering controls, such as physical barriers or dividers or rope and stanchion systems, to maintain at least six feet between screeners and workers being screened.
If screeners need to be within six feet of workers, provide them with appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) based on the tasks being performed.

At minimum, screeners should wear facemasks.
Additional PPE may include gloves, gowns, and face shields.
N95 filtering facepiece respirators (or more protective) may be appropriate for workers performing screening duties and necessary for workers managing a sick employee who has symptoms of COVID-19 in the work environment (see below). Note: If respirators are needed, they must be used in the context of a comprehensive respiratory protection program that includes medical exams, fit testing, and training in accordance with OSHA’s Respiratory Protection standard (29 CFR 1910.134external icon). <SEP> Should wildfire management agencies screen personnel for signs and symptoms of COVID-19? <EOS>

Safety Tips For Gatherings
During this difficult time, we understand everyone wants to spend time with family and friends. To ensure we don't inadvertently spread COVID-19 and needlessly put our loved ones at risk, the NJ Department of Health has offered some safety tips that can help reduce the risk of transmission when we gather in-person.

Remind invited guests to stay home if they have been exposed to the virus in the last 14 days, are showing COVID-19 symptoms, or recently travelled to an area or a state with high COVID-19 infection rates.
Ask guests to wear face coverings when they cannot social distance.
Make hand sanitizer available for guests.
Limit the number of people handling or serving food—for example, consider identifying one person to serve all food so that multiple people are not handling the serving utensils.
Remind guests to wash their hands before serving or eating food.
Use single-use hand towels or paper towels for drying hands so guests do not share a towel.
Clean and disinfect commonly touched surfaces and any shared items between use when feasible.
Consider keeping a list of guests who attended for potential future contract tracing needs. If you are called by a contact tracer, it's critical that you answer the call to protect us all. Your help is the key to stopping the spread of COVID-19 and saving lives.

For persons who remain asymptomatic following recovery from COVID-19, retesting (e.g., as part of a contact tracing investigation) is not necessary during the first 3 months after the date of symptom onset. When a positive test occurs less than 3 months after the person’s symptom onset of their most recent illness, it is possible that the positive test represents a new infection or a persistently positive test associated with the previous infection. If a positive test occurs more than 3 months after a person’s symptom onset, clinicians and public health authorities should consider the possibility of reinfection. Until we have more information, the determination of whether a patient with a positive test in these situations is contagious to others should be made on a case-by-case basis. Consider consultation with infectious diseases specialists and public health authorities to review all available information (e.g., medical history, time from initial positive test, RT-PCR Ct values, and presence of COVID-19 signs or symptoms).  Persons who are determined to be potentially infectious should undergo evaluation and remain isolated until they again meet criteria for discontinuation of isolation or discontinuation of transmission-based precautions, depending on their circumstances. <SEP> A person who previously tested positive by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 and clinically recovered from COVID-19 is later tested again, for example, as part of a contract tracing investigation.

Contact tracing is carried out by people who are assigned and trained to carry out this essential activity to break the chains of transmission. Electronic tools and information technology are not essential for contact tracing but can help to make it more efficient and are useful if contact tracing needs to be done on a large scale. Many digital tools have been developed to assist with COVID-19 contact tracing and case identification. These should not be considered as single solutions for contact tracing, but rather as complementary tools and should be carefully identified and analysed for technical, cost, and ethical issues.The Go.Data software application, for example, has been designed to support contact tracing and surveillance in outbreaks such as Ebola virus disease.

OLAW’s position is that because some IACUC members may not have access to software that generates digital signatures, an email acknowledgement from the member(s) may serve as their acceptance with the semiannual report. These emails should be retained for the record by the IACUC.
Under normal circumstances, the USDA’s position on this issue is that an email with no digital signature, just a signature block, is unacceptable. While digital signatures or scanned signatures are preferred, the USDA has made an exception in light of the current COVID-19 pandemic. The USDA has agreed to accept an email that states “This serves as my signature for the semi-annual report” (or related statement) and it must be clear that the email is from the IACUC member. Please keep in mind that this is a temporary change in the USDA’s position to assist institutions during the pandemic. Please contact your local VMO should a situation arise that differs from what is described above and for any updates or questions regarding the USDA’s position. <SEP> 19. May email responses from each IACUC member be used instead of digital or scanned signatures for the semiannual report to the Institutional Official? <EOS>
This depends entirely on what state or country you are living in. Many states, provinces, regions and countries are stopping what they call "non-essential services," such as cinemas, malls, restaurants, etc., while leaving open only essential services such as supermarkets, banks, pharmacies, etc. If this is the case where you are living, then even if you are well, you would not be able to go out to any non-essential place, in order to reduce the chances of spreading the infection. Check with your relevant government sites and trustworthy news sources as where you can and cannot go is a constantly changing situation. <SEP> Can you still go out and go shopping at the mall, go to the movies, etc., if you're not sick? <EOS>
Researchers have found that three quarters of new diseases come from animals. This is because every time a virus replicates, its genes can mutate and make it possible to spread from animals to people. Experts believe the novel coronavirus likely came from bats or pangolins.

Some medical procedures can produce very small droplets (called aerosolized droplet nuclei or aerosols) that are able to stay suspended in the air for longer periods of time. When such medical procedures are conducted on people infected with COVID-19 in health facilities, these aerosols can contain the COVID-19 virus. These aerosols may potentially be inhaled by others if they are not wearing appropriate personal protective equipment.  Therefore, it is essential that all health workers performing these medical procedures take specific airborne protection measures, including using appropriate personal protective equipment. Visitors should not be permitted in areas where such medical procedures are being performed. There have been reported outbreaks of COVID-19 in some closed settings, such as restaurants, nightclubs, places of worship or places of work where people may be shouting, talking, or singing.  In these outbreaks, aerosol transmission, particularly in these indoor locations where there are crowded and inadequately ventilated spaces where infected persons spend long periods of time with others, cannot be ruled out.  More studies are urgently needed to investigate such instances and assess their significance for transmission of COVID-19. <SEP> What do we know about aerosol transmission? <EOS>
The World Health Organization recommends washing your hands frequently with soap and water or hand sanitizer while you’re on the plane. If you have to cough or sneeze, cover your nose or mouth with a tissue or the crook of your elbow rather than your bare hand, and throw away any used tissues immediately. It can also help to open the air vent above your seat and aim it at your face, which will help ensure that the air you’re breathing has recently passed through the plane’s filtration system. <SEP> How do you prevent coronavirus on an airplane? <EOS>
Euthanasia of animals should be a last resort and the circumstances for when it is necessary should be described in the institution’s disaster plan. It is an institutional decision involving the veterinarian and the institution’s leadership. Careful planning and alternatives to consider include:

Transferring animals to a holding protocol,
Postponing unnecessary procedures or manipulations,
Relocating animals to another facility, and
Cryopreservation for certain species. <SEP> 4. If animals already on study need to be euthanized because the institution has shut down, what type of documentation or reporting is expected of the IACUC? <EOS>
Face coverings help reduce the spread of the virus.  As research has continued into COVID-19, more and more health professionals have agreed that face coverings are critical to continuing daily operations around the country, by reducing the spread of the virus.  Phase One's success hinges on everyone wearing face coverings in public settings.  Face coverings do not take the place of public health guidelines to maintain six feet of physical distancing, increase cleaning and sanitation, and wash hands regularly. <SEP> Why are face coverings/masks being required? <EOS>
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) is in continuous contact with the European Commission and the World Health Organization (WHO) regarding the assessment of this outbreak.

For all of the recommendations on self-care interventions on sexual and reproductive health issued by WHO, the evidence to date suggests that self care is safe, with the right level of support by the health service as needed.

Self-care can also benefit health workers, by allowing them to serve a greater number of patients and deploying their clinical skills where greatest need exists. During a pandemic such as COVID-19, adopting self-care as part of the healthcare system can also reduce the exposure of health workers to infection as self-care will reduce the number of in-person contacts with a health worker. <SEP> Is self care safe? <EOS>
Measures to prevent transmission of COVID-19 that apply to all workplaces and all people at the workplace include frequent hand-washing or disinfection with alcohol based hand sanitizer, respiratory hygiene such as covering coughs, physical distancing of at least 1 metre or more according to the national recommendations, wearing of masks where distancing is not possible, regular environmental cleaning and disinfection, and limiting unnecessary travel. Clear policies and messages, training, and education for staff and managers to increase awareness of COVID-19 are essential. The management of people with COVID-19 or their contacts is also critical e.g. requiring workers who are unwell or who develop symptoms to stay at home, self isolate and contact a medical professional or the local COVID-19 information line for advice on testing and referral. <SEP> What key measures to protect against COVID-19 should be undertaken in ALL workplaces? <EOS>
For those with access to the internet, the best sources of up-to-date information are the Virginia Department of Health website and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website. You can also call 877-ASK-VDH3 for additional information. <SEP> What are the most reliable sources of COVID-19 information? <EOS>
At the present time, the widespread use of masks everywhere is not supported by high-quality scientific evidence, and there are potential benefits and harms to consider.However, there are some settings in which it may not be possible to keep physical distancing and the use of a mask could be helpful to provide a barrier to limit the spread of potentially infectious droplets from someone who is infected. In addition, there is some evidence which suggests that some infected people without showing symptoms may be able to transmit the virus others.For this reason, WHO advises that governments should encourage the use of non-medical fabric masks, which can act as a barrier to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others where there are many cases of COVID-19, for people in the general public where physical distancing of at least 1 metre is not possible – such as, on public transport, in shops or in other confined or crowded environments.It is important to note that masks should only be used as part of a comprehensive strategy. Masks on their own will not protect you from COVID-19. People should also clean their hands frequently and maintain a distance of at least 1 metre from others. <SEP> Does WHO recommend the use of fabric masks for the general public? <EOS>
Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority. Most countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and many are experiencing outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with soap and
water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.Maintain at least 1 metre distance between yourself and others. Why? When someone coughs, sneezes, or speaks they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets,
    including the COVID-19 virus if the person has the disease.
Avoid going to crowded places. Why? Where people come together in crowds, you are more likely to come into close contact with someone that has COVID-19 and it is more difficult to maintain physical distance of 1 metre.
Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and infect you.
Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately and wash your hands. Why? Droplets
    spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene, you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.
Stay home and self-isolate even with minor symptoms such as cough, headache, mild fever, until you recover. Have someone bring you supplies. If you need to leave your house, wear a mask to avoid infecting others. Why? Avoiding contact with others will
    protect them from possible COVID-19 and other viruses.
If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention, but call by telephone in advance if possible and follow the directions of your local health authority. Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information
    on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.
Keep up to date on the latest information from trusted sources, such as WHO or your local and national health authorities. Why? Local and national authorities are best placed to advise on what people in your area should be doing to protect themselves. <SEP> What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease? <EOS>
Encourage teens to stick to a daily routine. That means eating on schedule, completing schoolwork, helping around the house, connecting with friends virtually, and limiting naps and screen time. 
One idea is to create a visual schedule—writing down tasks to do that day and posting it somewhere. Be sure to enlist your teen’s input on this list and allow downtime and fun time. “Keep the list very doable,” she stresses. “You don’t want to overwhelm your teen; you just want to create some structure for the day.” 
Let teens decide on virtual celebrations 
“Adolescence is a time when we want more independence, more choice,” Dr. Conn notes. “Being told ‘No, you can’t do any of the things you were doing before’ is particularly difficult for them. They feel like they don’t have control over their lives.” 
That’s why it’s important for parents to let teens choose how to mark those milestones they’re missing. “Some teens may be excited about a virtual prom, but others might say, ‘I feel weird getting all dressed up to sit in front of my computer,’” she says. “Don’t push it. Leave it up to them.” 
And if your teen wants to have a birthday or graduation party after the crisis, make sure that celebration happens. Don’t let it fall by the wayside after life gets busy again. 
Get moving 
A lack of physical activity can lead to depression—or make existing depression worse. “Teens need to get some exercise in, while still observing masking and physical distancing guidelines,” Dr. Conn says. “Even a walk around the block can be helpful.” 
Other options include online dance classes and workout videos. Gentle yoga and stretching via videos or mobile apps can also break up the day and boost their mood. 
Encourage teens to give back 
Lending a hand to others in need can empower adolescents and counter feelings of helplessness. Activities can be as simple as delivering groceries to a grandparent, sewing face masks for neighbors or calling a friend who’s had a tough week. 
“This is a good opportunity for teens to see themselves as leaders and find ways to support each other and their community,” she says.  
Ask for help 
If your teen is suffering from depression or anxiety or is withdrawing from friends, family and school, seek help. In addition to calling your teen’s primary care doctor, here are some resources for teens in crisis: 


National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 1-800-273-8255 




The Trevor Project (for LGBTQ youth): 1-866-488-7386 


California Youth Crisis Line: 1-800-843-5200 


Be kind to your teen—and yourself 
“It’s important for parents and caregivers to take care of their own mental health,” Dr. Conn says. “There are so many big, looming unknowns right now. We all need to hold ourselves with a lot of kindness! We need to have empathy and compassion not just for our youth, but for ourselves.” <SEP> Keep a routine <EOS>

No, it won't. While you might get a little warm or sweaty under your mask, face masks do not reduce the amount of oxygen that you take in with each breath. Similarly, there isn’t any scientific evidence that says wearing a mask lowers your immune system strength. If you’re having trouble breathing or you’re worried about how a face mask might affect your health, talk to your healthcare provider. 
If you have a tough time wearing a mask, try to limit the amount of time that you’re out and about so you can take your mask off quickly when you get home.
If you are exercising and feel like the mask is hindering your ability to breathe, try to work out in a large outdoor area away from other people or at home so you don’t have to wear a mask. <SEP> Will wearing a mask make it harder to breathe? <EOS>
At this time, there is no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 can spread to people from the skin or fur of pets.
Since animals can spread other diseases to people, it’s always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, such as washing your hands and maintaining good hygiene. Do not wipe or bathe your pet with chemical disinfectants, alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or any other products not approved for animal use. These substances may poison your pet and lead to serious illness or death. <SEP> Can animals carry the virus that causes COVID-19 on their skin or fur? <EOS>
Recently published research found that on average, the time from exposure to symptom onset (known as the incubation period) is about five to six days. However, studies have shown that symptoms could appear as soon as three days after exposure to as long as 13 days later. These findings continue to support the CDC recommendation of self-quarantine and monitoring of symptoms for 14 days post exposure. <SEP> How long is it between when a person is exposed to the virus and when they start showing symptoms? <EOS>
No. If your business facility has an onsite cafeteria, the cafeteria may not provide indoor dining services. The
    cafeteria may provide outdoor dining services (following all the rules in the Mandatory
        Directive for Outdoor Dining), and it may also
    provide food for workers to take out of the cafeteria and eat elsewhere in or around the facility. Workers are
    encouraged to eat their meals outside whenever feasible. The cafeteria must also follow all applicable rules in the

Before the pandemic, there was not much research about the benefit of wearing cloth face coverings to prevent COVID-19. Some researchers compared countries that promoted face coverings as part of their early response to countries, like the US, that did not. The countries that promoted face coverings ended up with fewer cases than the countries that did not. Research is continuing and we are still learning more, but we now know that COVID-19 can be spread by people who do not know they have it. The virus that causes COVID-19 is likely spread by droplets you exhale as you breathe, as well as when you talk, sing, cough or sneeze. If you wear a face covering, you help keep those droplets to yourself. <SEP> How do we know face coverings are effective? <EOS>

Consult with your state and local health officials to discuss the particular situation in your community.  In general, the more people a young person interacts with, the closer the interaction, and the longer that interaction, the higher the risk of COVID-19 spread. There are several actions that sports camp administrators can take to reduce this risk. They can prioritize outdoor instead of indoor activities if safe conditions allow. Coaches could focus on individual skill-building drills that allow for social distancing. Also, coaches can put athletes into small groups that remain together and work through stations, rather than switching groups or mixing groups.
There is also less risk if all athletes are from the local geographic area. Tournament directors may consider limiting the number of teams participating at one time or perhaps cohorting teams from the same local geographic area together.
They may also encourage teams and spectators to engage in health protective behaviors as much as possible, including handwashing, social distancing, and wearing cloth face coverings. In addition, CDC has developed resources including a Youth Camps Decision Tool and Youth and Summer Camps Considerations.

Local decisions depend on local circumstances. Per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevent (CDC), https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html people with COVID-19 who have stayed home (home isolated) can stop home isolation under the following conditions:

If you had symptoms and were directed to take care of yourself at home, you may leave home when:


have had no fever for at least 72 hours (that is 3 full days of no fever without the use medicine that reduces fevers)
other symptoms have improved (for example, when your cough or shortness of breath have improved) AND
it’s been 10 days since your symptoms first appeared


If you tested positive and have to be tested to determine if you are still contagious, you can leave home after these 3 things have happened:


you no longer have a fever (without the use medicine that reduces fevers) AND
other symptoms have improved (for example, when your cough or shortness of breath have improved) AND
you received two negative tests in a row, 24 hours apart or per CDC guidelines.


If you tested positive for COVID-19, but had no symptoms, you can be with others after 10 days have passed since you were tested. Your health care provider may advise you to be tested. 

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/end-home-isolation.html
What you need to know if you decide to go out:

In general, the more closely you interact with others and the longer that interaction, the higher the risk of COVID-19 spread.
If you decide to engage in public activities, continue to protect yourself by practicing everyday preventive actions.
Keep these items on hand when venturing out: a cloth face covering, tissues, and a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, if possible.

For more guidance, visit: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/deciding-to-go-out.html <SEP> What about returning to work or going back out in public? <EOS>
No. For patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection, decisions about discharge from the hospital should be based on their clinical status and the ability of an accepting facility to meet their care needs and adhere to recommended infection prevention and control practices. Decisions about hospital discharge are distinct from decisions about discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions.
For patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, decisions about discontinuing Transmission-Based Precautions should be based on the strategies outlined here. The test-based strategy is recommended only for use in limited circumstances.
If a patient with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection has not met criteria for discontinuing Transmission-Based Precautions, they should be transferred to a facility with the ability to adhere to infection prevention and control recommendations for the care of residents with SARS-CoV-2 infection, including placement in a unit or area of the facility designated to care for residents with SARS-CoV-2 infection and provision of recommended personal protective equipment to healthcare personnel.
If the patient has met the criteria for discontinuing Transmission-Based Precautions, they do not require additional restrictions.
A patient hospitalized for non-COVID-related illnesses who is not known to have SARS-CoV-2 infection can be transferred to a nursing home without testing. To ensure a patient was not exposed and might subsequently develop SARS-CoV-2 infection, nursing homes should place the patient in Transmission-based Precautions in a separate observation area or in a single-person room for 14 days after admission.
As part of universal source control measures, all residents (including those described in the scenarios above) should wear a cloth face covering or facemask (if tolerated) whenever they leave their room. <SEP> Is a negative test for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, required before a hospitalized patient can be discharged to a nursing home? <EOS>
 Yes. The settings in which an EUA-authorized test may be used are described in the Letter of Authorization. As discussed in the Guidance for Industry and Other Stakeholders: Emergency Use Authorization of Medical Products and Related Authorities, when the FDA authorizes tests for use at the point of care (including SARS-CoV-2 point of care test systems) under an EUA, such tests are deemed to be CLIA waived tests. Accordingly, for the duration of the emergency declaration, such tests can be performed in a patient care setting that is qualified to have the test performed there as a result of operating under a CLIA Certificate of Waiver, Certificate of Compliance, or Certificate of Accreditation.
We note that the term point of care in the EUAs may include settings such as hospitals, physician offices, urgent care, outreach clinics, pharmacies, and temporary patient care settings that have appropriately trained personnel to perform the test and are operating under a CLIA Certificate of Waiver or Certificate of Compliance. These terms generally do not apply to home specimen collection or at home testing unless otherwise specified. <SEP>  When FDA authorizes under an EUA a SARS-CoV-2 test for use at the point of care, does that mean it is CLIA waived?

The Virginia Department of Social Services is closely monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic and are most concerned about the health and safety of families, staff and other individuals who attend and work in the Commonwealth’s child care programs.
For child care programs and centers that remain open during this time in Phase III, it is encouraged that they adapt their service settings as much as possible to align with public health recommendations. Specific Phase III Department of Social Services guidelines for child care can be found here. Please also visit the Department of Social Services COVID-19 child care website to learn more information.
Once COVID-19 has been detected in the community and the childcare center remains open, childcare centers should:

Educate parents and staff on the signs and symptoms of COVID-19. Encourage employees at greater risk to stay at home.
Communicate with parents to keep children who are sick at home.
Implement social distancing strategies such as classroom spacing, including the same group each day in the same classroom with the same teachers, with no more than 10 people in a room, (including teachers). Also consider altering or halting group activities, staggering playground time and keeping groups separate for art, music and exercising. Provide adequate supplies for good hygiene.
Practice frequent hand washing and sanitize surfaces frequently. Refer to CDC guidance on cleaning and disinfecting procedures for child care centers that remain open. Consider placing hand hygiene stations at the entrance of the facility, so that children and staff can clean their hands before they enter. If a sink with soap and water is not available, provide hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol next to parent sign-in sheets.
Consider screening children and staff before entering the building. Persons who have a fever of 100.40(38.00C) or above or other signs of illness should not be admitted to the facility.
Restrict outside visitors and volunteers.
Ensure children's naptime mats or cribs are spaced out as much as possible, ideally 6 feet apart. Consider placing children head to toe when napping.
Modify drop off and pick up procedures. Consider staggering arrival and drop off times and/or have child care providers come outside the facility to pick up the children as they arrive or deliver to parents at pick-up.
When feasible, staff members and older children should wear face coveringswithin the facility. Cloth face coverings should NOT be put on babies and children under age two.
Childcare centers should review the  Phase III guidance provided by the Department of Social Services on their website to prepare and respond to COVID-19 situations.   Review CDC's guidance for Schools and Child Care Programs and Supplemental Guidance for Child Care Programs That Remain Open (updated April 21, 2020). <SEP> If there have been COVID-19 cases in the community, what can my childcare center do? <EOS>
Every individual’s circumstances are unique, and there are a number of variables that must be taken into account before deciding to make use of leave code 699. Managers must discuss all options available to their affected employee (telework, child care, etc.) and are encouraged to engage with their Labour Relations (LR) advisor for advice in ensuring the use of this leave provision is appropriate before granting approval. Without knowing the particulars of your situation, the broad application of leave with pay for other reasons (code 699) is as follows:

The employee is part of the vulnerable population
The employee lives with or is caring for a member of the vulnerable population
The employee is experiencing childcare limitations
The employee is ready and able to work, but their duties cannot be performed remotely
The employee has been diagnosed or are presumed to have contracted COVID-19

In accordance with direction from the Office of the Chief Human Resources Officer (OCHRO), Leave with Other Reasons (code 699) applies to situations specific to COVID-19, as it relates to circumstances that hinder the employee’s ability to perform their work. The specific conditions of this leave provision in the context of COVID-19 will be re-evaluated at the end of June, in accordance with direction from Public Health and in alignment with direction from central agencies.
The Department of National Defence (DND) is enforcing protocols as outlined by the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat (TBS) and recommends that managers use their best judgment when granting this special leave provision. DND will continue to exercise a good faith approach with respect to leave with pay for other reasons. It is therefore expected that:

Employees explore all care options available to them
Managers have discussions with their employees and consider flexibilities outlined in collective agreements as well as leveraging the use of the Flexible Work Program
Code 699 is available to bridge the gap when full time hours are not possible

We encourage you to use HR Connect or the HR Go app if you have additional questions. More information can also be found here:  https://www.canada.ca/en/government/publicservice/covid-19/employee-illness-leave.html <SEP> An employee cannot return to work because they are providing care for their child who has some risk factors.

Hotels, AirBnB, and other short-term rentals are allowed to open. However, be sure to check with your destination to see if there are any local restrictions.
The State has issued Executive and Administrative Orders which allows municipalities and counties to impose restrictions on hotels, motels, guest houses, and online marketplaces for arranging and offering lodging.
To save lives and stop the spread of COVID-19, wear a mask, wash your hands, practice social distancing, and stay home if you are sick.
Face coverings are required in indoor public spaces and in outdoor public spaces when social distancing is difficult to maintain.
Hotel Sanitization Guidance
Hotels and motels must comply with the safety protocols outlined in Department of Health Executive Directive No. 20-024, which includes:

Maintaining continuous 24-hour, seven-day-a-week coverage of a Front Desk by at least one employee,
Training a Front Desk employee to respond to a guests' inquiry related to health and safety, including but not limited to, the location of hospitals in the vicinity of the hotel, emergency telephone numbers, and options for seeking treatment or testing for virus diseases during a public health crisis
Ensuring every guest room is cleaned and sanitized and provided with an adequate supply of clean towels, sheets, and pillowcases prior to occupancy by a new guest
Ensuring every occupied guest room is cleaned and sanitized every day, and that the room is provided with an adequate supply of clean towels, sheets, and pillowcases and that the towels, sheets, and pillowcases are changed no less frequently than once every day
Ensuring all public spaces are cleaned and sanitized at least once every day
Ensuring all frequently touched surfaces by guests are cleaned and sanitized regularly throughout each day
Providing employees with sanitization products

For a full list of safety requirements, businesses should refer to Executive Directive No. 20-024.

It is very difficult to accurately predict the surge without having sufficient testing capacity for the population. Depending on the scale of testing in the area, cities may be able to look at test results to understand the likely surge in patients coming in the ensuing 2-4 weeks. Cities should also closely monitor the hospital system to assess the number of hospitalized and ICU patients, as well as the doubling time in the growth of the number of these patients. If there is a single call center for people with symptoms, the number of calls should be tracked as one measure to watch. There are other emerging sources of data, such as fevers reported by companies that make internet-enabled thermometers.

 The FDA does not generally regulate the use of a test for surveillance purposes, such as determining the prevalence of acute infections in a population. The FDA understands that results have been returned to individuals tested for COVID-19 surveillance purposes. If surveillance testing is performed by a non-CLIA certified laboratory, an individual who tests positive for SARS-CoV-2 should have a confirmatory test performed by a CLIA-certified laboratory.  Surveillance with return of results and surveillance with pooled or batched testing should be validated on a test platform and test of high sensitivity and positive tests should have a confirmatory test. <SEP>  Can an EUA-authorized SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test be used for surveillance for COVID-19?

WHO recommends that all vaccination in schools and mass campaigns should be postponed during the COVID-19 pandemic. However,  vaccines provided to adolescents have sufficiently flexible schedules to make sure you can get the vaccine in time when vaccination services start again. For example, the HPV vaccine that requires two doses can be started any time between 9 and 14 years of age and the interval between the two doses can be longer. The minimum interval between doses is 6 months, but it can be 12 or 15 months and, if necessary, even longer. It is most important hat you receive the t second dose at some point in time to be fully protected. Decisions to continue routine vaccination services are made by each country. Ask a family member or another trusted adult how you can get information about vaccination services where you live.  It is important you get the vaccines you are supposed to get, even if they have to be delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Read more:https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/331590/WHO-2019-nCoV-immunization_services-2020.1-eng.pdf https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/331818/WHO-2019-nCoV-immunization_services-FAQ-2020.1-eng.pdf <SEP> I was due to get vaccinated for HPV, meningitis or tetanus, but immunization services have been disrupted.

Stay in touch with your child’s school.

Many schools are offering lessons online (virtual learning). Review assignments from the school, and help your child establish a reasonable pace for completing the work. You may need to assist your child with turning on devices, reading instructions, and typing answers.


Create a schedule and routine for learning at home, but remain flexible.
Consider the needs and adjustment required for your child’s age group.

The transition to being at home will be different for preschoolers, K-5, middle school students, and high school students. Talk to your child about expectations and how they are adjusting to being at home versus at school.


Look for ways to make learning fun.

 As noted in the Policy for Coronavirus Disease-2019 Tests, the policies outlined in the guidance do not apply to at-home testing or testing at other non-laboratory settings, including the collection of a specimen at home. Developers of COVID-19 tests for at-home testing, with or without the use of telemedicine, are expected to request and receive an EUA for their test prior to offering or distributing the test.
The FDA is supportive of testing for COVID-19 that can be performed at home or in other non-laboratory settings, such as offices or schools, provided there is data and science to support consumer safety and test accuracy.
FDA has provided a Template for Manufacturers of Molecular and Antigen Diagnostic COVID-19 Tests for Non-Laboratory Use to help facilitate the preparation and submission of EUA requests, and the authorization of these types of tests.  The template includes recommendations about what testing should be performed to demonstrate that a COVID-19 test for home/non-lab use has been validated, recommendations for generally expected performance metrics, and recommendations for demonstrating the ability of a lay user to collect their specimen, run the test, and interpret their results accurately. Additionally, this template provides information about what safety considerations should be considered in an EUA request, including safety from any exposure to toxic chemicals that may be used in the reaction. Due to the benefits of broader access to simple and fast testing options from tests that can be performed completely outside of a laboratory, a lower sensitivity of such tests, when compared to tests run in a laboratory, may be appropriate.
As explained in the template, when FDA receives an EUA submission with validation to support consumer safety and test reliability and accuracy for COVID-19 tests for non-laboratory use, FDA will generally evaluate and may issue EUAs for such tests when the criteria for authorization are met. All such authorizations will include, among other conditions, any necessary conditions of authorization to address different risks presented by specimen collection outside healthcare settings versus collection in a healthcare setting, as well as testing and interpreting results by a lay consumer rather than a healthcare professional. <SEP>  Does FDA have validation or other recommendations regarding tests for use at home or other non-laboratory settings, where the collection of a specimen, testing, and interpreting results are all completed outside of a laboratory?

Currently, there is no specific treatment for coronavirus infections. For mild illness, treatment consists of supportive care, relief of symptoms, drinking plenty of fluids, staying home to rest, and practicing home isolation and social distancing within the household to avoid spreading infection to others. Over-the-counter (OTC) medication can help with symptoms (see the table here).  Children under the age of 6 years should not be given OTC cough or cold medications; they offer little benefit and may have serious side effects. All OTC medication should be used according to the package instructions.  For persons with mild illness, these measures may be all that is needed.
For people with more serious illness, you should call your healthcare provider and follow their recommendations for treatment and self-care.
For people who develop emergency warning signs such as (1) trouble breathing, (2) persistent pain or pressure in the chest, (3) new confusion or inability to arouse or (4) bluish lips or face, immediate medical attention is needed and 911 should be called.  Please note this list is not all inclusive and any person who has other severe or concerning symptoms should contact his/her medical provider.  If you need to call 911, notify the dispatch personnel that you have, or are being evaluated for, COVID-19. If possible, put on a facemask before emergency medical services arrive. Do not place a facemask or cloth mask of any kind on children under 2 years of age.

In addition, crisis centers, shelters, legal aid, and protection services for individuals subject to violence. <SEP> Who is self care for? <EOS>
Always remember the basics, like washing your hands frequently (and reminding members of your household to do the same).
The coronavirus isn’t really transmitted on surfaces. Or, at least, surfaces are a much lower risk than person-to-person transmission. So although disinfecting isn’t a bad idea, you probably don’t need to be quite as vigilant now as we initially thought. 
Mostly, keep people who might be infected out of your house. But the safest thing you can do to keep your home safe is to keep yourself safe when you’re outside of your home. That means wearing a mask and socially distancing whenever possible. <SEP> What should I do to keep my home safe? Should I still be disinfecting everything? <EOS>
Occupational Safety and Health Administration  (OSHA) (Alert, Guidance) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have issued workplace guidance to  guide employers during the COVID-19 outbreak. They describe how employers should  develop preparedness plans and communicate those plans to protect workers through  effective training. Employers should assess worker exposure to hazards and  risks and implement infection prevention measures to reasonably address them  consistent with OSHA Standards. Such measures could include promoting frequent and thorough handwashing  or sanitizing with at least 60% alcohol hand sanitizer; encouraging workers to stay  at home if sick; encouraging use of cloth face coverings; and training them on proper respiratory etiquette, social  distancing, and other steps they can take to protect themselves.. Employers may  need to consider using stanchions to help keep workers and others at the  worksite at least 6 feet away from each other. Installing temporary barriers  and shields and spacing out workstations can also help achieve social  distancing recommendations. Employers should  clean and disinfect frequently touched  surfaces (e.g., door handles, sink handles, workstations, restroom stalls) at  least daily, or as much as possible. Employers subject to OSHA's PPE standard must also provide and require the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) when  needed. Job hazard assessments must be conducted to determine the appropriate type  and level of PPE required.
The U.S. Department of Labor  and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Guidance on Preparing Workplaces for COVID-19 (Spanish)  and OSHA's Prevent Worker Exposure to COVID-19 alert (Spanish) provide more  information on steps all employers can take to reduce workers' risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2.

At this time, social and physical distancing are important to follow, so overall, travel is discouraged. Outbreaks of the new coronavirus and COVID-19, the disease it causes, are occurring in the United States and in countries around the world. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has updated travel information on a range of destinations.

Children still should get all their vaccines on
               schedule. Skipping vaccines could put them
               at risk for diseases that vaccines can prevent, such as measles
               and whooping cough. These illnesses
               have made a comeback, possibly because some kids are not getting their vaccinations.
               As communities and schools reopen, children are exposed to these germs when in public.
               Those who aren't protected by vaccines will be more likely to get infected. Kids with
               an infection may have a harder time getting better if they also get COVID-19.
Everyone 6 months of age and older in your family should get the flu
               shot when it is available. It's always important to protect your family from the flu. But during the pandemic, there are extra
               reasons. Doctor's offices, hospitals, and urgent care centers will likely be busy
               caring for many people with COVID-19 this flu season. Preventing flu in your family
               will help you avoid needing medical care when health care providers are under so much
               strain. Also, some health experts worry that people who get the flu and COVID-19 at
               the same time might have a more serious illness.
If you're concerned about your healthy child getting vaccinated in the doctor's
               office, ask if this can be done curbside. During the pandemic, some health care providers
               are giving vaccines to children while they stay in the car. <SEP> Should Kids Still Get Vaccines? <EOS>
Answer The Call – Protect Your Loved Ones – Stop COVID-19
Your help is the key to stopping the spread of COVID-19 and protecting your loved ones.
Contact tracers are calling with life-saving information that will keep you, your loved ones, and your community safe and healthy. So when a contact tracer calls, answer the phone.
The only reason you have been called is because you may have come into close contact with an individual confirmed to have COVID-19 or you tested positive for COVID-19 and may have spread the virus to others without knowing it.
That's why if you test postiive, we ask you to share your close contacts – anyone who was within six feet of you for more than 10 minutes starting two days before you first had symptoms – solely for the purpose of helping those people get tested or quarantine as they could be infecting others.
Your information is confidential. Your name will not be released to your contacts or your COVID-19 status – that information will only be known to public health officials and our local health department partners, if needed.

Currently, there is no evidence to suggest the virus that causes COVID-19 is circulating in free-living wildlife in the United States, or that wildlife might be a source of infection for people in the United States. The first case of a wild animal testing positive for the virus in the United States was a tiger with a respiratory illness at a zoo in New York City. However, this tiger was in a captive zoo environment ,and public health officials believe the tiger became sick after being exposed to a zoo employee who was infected and spreading the virus.
If a wild animal were to become infected with the virus, we don’t know whether the infection could then spread among wildlife or if it could spread to other animals, including pets. Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals, including wildlife, could be affected by COVID-19. Because wildlife can carry other diseases, even without looking sick, it is always important to enjoy wildlife from a distance.
Take steps to prevent getting sick from wildlife in the United States:

Keep your family, including pets, a safe distance away from wildlife.
Do not feed wildlife or touch wildlife droppings.
Always wash your hands and supervise children washing their hands after working or playing outside.
Leave orphaned animals alone. Often, the parents are close by and will return for their young.
Consult your state wildlife agency’s guidance if you are preparing or consuming legally harvested game meat.
Do not approach or touch a sick or dead animal – contact your state wildlife agency instead. <SEP> Can wild animals spread the virus that causes COVID-19 to people or pets? <EOS>
CDC recommends collecting and testing a single upper respiratory swab from the nostril. This sample is then processed. Using a technique called real-time reverse transcriptase (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the test can detect the COVID-19 virus RNA genome. In practice, coronaviruses need to replicate a reasonable amount in order for there to be enough genetic material that can be used for the test.

People-centred delivery of tuberculosis (TB) prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care services should be ensured in tandem with the COVID-19 response.Prevention: Measures must be implemented to limit transmission of TB and COVID-19 in congregate settings and health care facilities. Administrative, environmental and personal protection measures apply to both (e.g. basic infection prevention and control, cough etiquette, patient triage). Provision of TB preventive treatment should be maintained as much as possible.Diagnosis: Tests for TB and COVID-9 are different and both should be made available for individuals with respiratory symptoms, which may be similar for the two diseases. Treatment and care: People-centred outpatient and community-based care should be strongly preferred over hospital treatment for TB patients (unless serious conditions require hospitalization) to reduce opportunities for transmission. Anti-TB treatment, in line with the latest WHO guidelines, must be provided for all TB patients, including those in quarantine and those with confirmed COVID-19 disease. Adequate stocks of TB medicines should be provided to all patients to reduce trips to collect medicines.Use of digital health technologies for patients and programmes should be intensified. In line with WHO recommendations, technologies like electronic medication monitors and video-supported therapy can help patients complete their TB treatment. <SEP> What should health authorities do to provide sustainability of essential tuberculosis services during the COVID-19 pandemic? <EOS>
CDC is not aware of any scientific reports of the virus that causes COVID-19 spreading to people through the water in lakes, oceans, rivers, or other natural bodies of water.
The virus mainly spreads when respiratory droplets from infected people land in the mouths or noses of others or possibly when inhaled into the lungs by others. If a public beach or other swim area in a natural body of water is open, it is important for all visitors and staff to take steps to slow the spread of the virus:

Stay home if you are infected or might be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.
Stay at least 6 feet apart (in and out of the water) from people you don’t live with.
Wear cloth masks when not in water.
Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue (or use the inside of your elbow), throw used tissues in the trash, and wash hands.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not readily available.

See Considerations for Public Beaches for more information.
RNAexternal icon of the virus that causes COVID-19 has been found in untreated wastewater, which can come from combined sewer overflowsexternal icon (rainwater runoff, domestic sewage, and industrial wastewater) and other sourcesexternal icon (such as, leaking septic tanks or animal waste from farms nearby) and enter swim areas. While data are limited, there is little evidence of infectious virus in wastewater. Plus, CDC is not aware of any scientific reports of the virus being spread by swallowing or coming in contact with water contaminated by feces (poop) from an infected person.
At lakes, oceans, and rivers with routine water quality monitoring programs, staff look for changes in fecal (poop) contamination of the water. Water quality advisories and beach closures alert the public to avoid getting in or on the water because of increased fecal contamination.

The best way to prevent COVID-19 is to avoid being exposed to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. All firefighters and support personnel should have a basic understanding of COVID-19, how the disease is thought to spread, what the symptoms of the disease are, and what measures can be taken to prevent or minimize the transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19.
During the fire season, it will be important that members of each fire crew or module make an effort to operate and isolate as a unit. Management will need to develop and implement procedures and protocols to prevent possible exposures to the virus. When possible, crews should not interchange personnel or equipment between units and should limit the number of personnel who must interact with people in the community (e.g. fueling vehicles, picking up supplies, etc.). This will require planning and using technology to safely accomplish tasks while maintaining social distancing as much as possible. This may include implementing procedures that allow fire crews or incident management personnel to stay remote, isolate from other units, or complete tasks or missions virtually. If close contact with others in the community is necessary, it is advised that all personnel wear facemasks or cloth face coverings for source control.
Wildfire management and personnel should prioritize reducing fatigue and remaining healthy throughout the fire season. Rest and proper hydration and nutrition should be prioritized and emphasized every workday. <SEP> What steps can be taken by wildland fire personnel to prevent infection and spread of COVID-19?

Current evidence suggests that COVID-19 spreads between people through direct, indirect (through contaminated objects or surfaces), or close contact with infected people via mouth and nose secretions. These include saliva, respiratory secretions or secretion droplets. These are released from the mouth or nose when an infected person coughs, sneezes, speaks or sings, for example. People who are in close contact (within 1 metre) with an infected person can catch COVID-19 when those infectious droplets get into their mouth, nose or eyes. To avoid contact with these droplets, it is important to stay at least 1 metre away from others, clean hands frequently, and cover the mouth with a tissue or bent elbow when sneezing or coughing. When physical distancing (standing one metre or more away) is not possible, wearing a fabric mask is an important measure to protect others. Cleaning hands frequently is also critical. <SEP> How is the virus that causes COVID-19 most commonly transmitted between people? <EOS>

The symptoms of COVID-19 can be like those of other viruses, like colds
               and the flu. So chances are, unless you get tested,
               you won't know if you have COVID-19. Call your health care provider right away if
               you have any symptoms, such as a cough, fever, or trouble breathing.
Other symptoms may include:

symptoms of a cold such as a sore throat, congestion, or a runny nose
chills
muscle pain
headache
a loss of taste or smell
nausea or vomiting
diarrhea
tiredness

The answer to all of the above is that it is critical that everyone begin intensive social distancing immediately. As much as possible, limit contact with people outside your family.If you need to get food, staples, medications or healthcare, try to stay at least six feet away from others, and wash your hands thoroughly after the trip, avoiding contact with your face and mouth throughout. Prepare your own food as much as possible. If you do order takeout,  open the bag, box or containers, then wash your hands. Lift, fork or spoon out the contents into your own dishes. After you dispose of these outside containers, wash your hands again. Most restaurants, gyms and public pools are closed; but even if one is open, now is not the time to go.Here are some other things to avoid: playdates, parties, sleepovers, having friends or family over for meals or visits, and going to coffee shops — essentially any nonessential activity that involves close contact with others. <SEP> What should and shouldn't I do during this time to avoid exposure to and spread of this coronavirus?

Using a PCR diagnostic test, a negative result means that the virus that causes COVID-19 was not found in the person’s sample. This can happen when a person is tested too early in their incubation period, and there isn’t enough viral material for the test to detect.
False negative PCR results can also occur if a sample was collected improperly or not handled or stored at proper temperatures.
For COVID-19, a negative PCR test result for a sample collected while a person has symptoms likely means that the COVID-19 virus is not causing their current illness. <SEP> Can a person test negative and later test positive for COVID-19? <EOS>
 AHCCCS has established two telephonic code sets that are available for use:

Anyone who had prolonged close contact (within 6 feet for at least 15 minutes) with the infected healthcare provider might have been exposed.

If the provider had COVID-19 symptoms, the provider is considered potentially infectious beginning 2 days before symptoms first appeared until the provider meets criteria to discontinue Transmission-Based Precautions or Home Isolation.
If the provider did not have symptoms, collecting information about when the provider may have been exposed could help inform the period when they were infectious.

If an exposure is identified. The provider should be considered potentially infectious beginning 2 days after the exposure until criteria to discontinue Transmission-Based Precautions or Home Isolation are met.
If the date of exposure cannot be determined. For the purposes of contact tracing, it is reasonable to use a cutoff of 2 days before the specimen testing positive for COVID-19 was collected as the starting point, continuing until the criteria to discontinue Transmission-Based Precautions or Home Isolation are met. Although the infectious period is generally accepted to be 10 days after onset of infection, eliciting contacts during the entire 10 days before obtaining the specimen that tested positive for COVID-19 is likely inefficient.  In most situations an exposed provider cannot recall all contacts over the preceding 10 days.  Also, because recent data suggest that asymptomatic persons may have a lower viral burden at diagnosis than symptomatic persons, the additional resources required may divert case investigation and contact tracing resources away from activities most likely to interrupt ongoing transmission.



Contact tracing is generally recommended for anyone who had prolonged close contact with the person with COVID-19 during these time periods.  While this question addresses exposure to a potentially infectious provider, the following actions are also recommended if the potentially infectious individual is a patient or visitor.
Recommended actions for HCP, patients, and visitors:

Perform a risk assessment and apply work restrictions for other HCP who were exposed to the infected provider based on whether these HCP had prolonged, close contact and what PPE they were wearing. More detailed information is available in the Interim U.S. Guidance for Risk Assessment and Work Restrictions for Healthcare Personnel with Potential Exposure to COVID-19.
Place exposed patients who are currently admitted to the healthcare facility in appropriate Transmission-Based Precautions and monitor them for onset of COVID-19 until 14 days after their last exposure.
Perform contact tracing of exposed patients who are not currently admitted to the healthcare facility and for visitors as described in Health Departments: Interim Guidance on Developing a COVID-19 Case Investigation and Contact Tracing Planpdf icon.

Healthcare facilities should have a process for notifying the health department about known or suspected cases of COVID-19, and should establish a plan, in consultation with local public health authorities, for how exposures in a healthcare facility will be investigated and how contact tracing will be performed.  The plan should address the following:

Who is responsible for identifying contacts and notifying potentially exposed individuals?
How will such notifications occur?
What actions and follow-up are recommended for those who were exposed?

Contact tracing should be carried out in a way that protects the confidentiality of affected individuals to the extent possible and is consistent with applicable laws and regulations.  HCP and patients who are currently admitted to the facility or were transferred to another healthcare facility should be prioritized for notification.  These groups, if infected, have the potential to expose a large number of individuals at higher risk for severe disease, or in the situation of admitted patients, be at higher risk for severe illness themselves.
Information for health departments about case investigation and contact tracing is available in the Health Departments:  Interim Guidance on Developing a COVID-19 Case Investigation and Contact Tracing Planpdf icon.  This guidance could also be helpful to healthcare facilities performing such activities. <SEP> A healthcare provider at our facility was recently diagnosed with COVID-19.

Very limited data are available about detection of SARS-CoV-2 and infectious virus in clinical specimens. SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected from upper and lower respiratory tract specimens, and SARS-CoV-2 has been isolated from upper respiratory tract specimens and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in blood and stool specimens, but whether infectious virus is present in extrapulmonary specimens is currently unknown. The duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in upper and lower respiratory tract specimens and in extrapulmonary specimens is not yet known but may be several weeks or longer, which has been observed in cases of MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV infection. While viable, infectious SARS-CoV has been isolated from respiratory, blood, urine, and stool specimens, in contrast – viable, infectious MERS-CoV has only been isolated from respiratory tract specimens. It is not yet known whether other non-respiratory body fluids from an infected person including vomit, urine, breast milk, or semen can contain viable, infectious SARS-CoV-2.

There is still a lot that is unknown about the newly emerged COVID-19 and how it spreads. Two other coronaviruses have emerged previously to cause severe illness in people (MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV). The virus that causes COVID-19 is more genetically related to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV, but both are betacoronaviruses with their origins in bats. While we don't know for sure that this virus will behave the same way as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, we can use the information gained from both of these earlier coronaviruses to guide us. In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient temperatures. Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with imported goods and there have not been any cases of COVID-19 in the United States associated with imported goods. Information will be provided on the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) website as it becomes available.

Generally, your employer may require you to come to work during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, some government emergency orders may affect which businesses can remain open during the pandemic.
Under federal law, you are entitled to a safe workplace. Your employer must provide a safe and healthful workplace. If you have concerns, you have the right to speak up about them without fear of retaliation.
Under section 11(c) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, a worker who refused to work  would be protected from retaliation if:

The worker believes that they faced death or serious injury (and the situation is so clearly hazardous that any reasonable person would believe the same thing);
The worker tried, where possible, to get his or her employer to correct the condition, was unable to obtain a correction, and there is no other way to do the job safely; or
The situation is so urgent that the worker does not have time to eliminate the hazard through regulatory channels, such as calling OSHA.

See 29 CFR 1977.12(b) for more information.
Employers and workers can visit  the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's COVID-19 webpage and frequently asked questions to learn more about reasonable accommodations.
You have the right to file a complaint if you are  required to work and believe you are being exposed to a serious health or  safety hazard. If you have suffered retaliation because you voiced concerns  about a health or safety hazard, you have the right to file a whistleblower protection complaint. No particular  form is required and complaints may be submitted in any language.

Physical distancing aims to reduce physical contact between potentially infected people and healthy people, or between population groups with high rates of transmission and others with low or no level of transmission. The objective of this is to decrease or interrupt the spread of COVID-19.
Note that the term ‘physical distancing’ means the same thing as the widely used term ‘social distancing’, but it more accurately describes what is intended, namely that people keep physically apart. It is possible that physical distancing measures will have to be implemented over an extended period, and their success depends partially on ensuring that people maintain social contact – from a distance – with friends, family and colleagues. Internet-based communications and the phone are therefore key tools for ensuring a successful physical distancing strategy.
On a personal level, you can perform physical distancing measures by:
Voluntarily self-isolating if you know you have the virus that causes COVID-19, or if you have suggestive respiratory symptoms, or if you belong to a high-risk group (i.e. you are aged 70 years or more, or you have an underlying health condition).
Many countries in the EU/EEA and the UK have installed quarantine and social/physical distancing as measures to prevent the further spread of the virus.
These measures can include:
The full or partial closure of educational institutions and workplaces;
Limiting the number of visitors and limiting the contact between the residents of confined settings, such as long-term care facilities and prisons;
Cancellation, prohibition and restriction of mass gatherings and smaller meetings;
Mandatory quarantine of buildings or residential areas;
Internal or external border closures;
Stay-at-home restrictions for entire regions or countries. <SEP> 3. What is physical distancing and why and how should I do it? <EOS>
The general guidelines outlined in the Codex Code of Hygienic Practice for the Transport of Food in Bulk and Semi-Packed Food.1 should be followed, in addition to ensuring that employees delivering foods are free from COVID-19, coughing/sneezing etiquette is practiced by all involved in food transport and that frequent hand washing/sanitizing is practiced and staff practice physical distancing.See also other Codes of Hygienic Practice for various groups of food. <SEP> What measures should be taken to ensure safe transport of food during this pandemic? <EOS>
Many viruses, such as the flu, do not spread as rapidly in spring and summer months. However, since COVID-19 is a new virus, scientists don't yet know what will happen once the weather gets warmer. However, many experts speculate that COVID-19 will not slow down during the warm weather and will continue to spread rapidly throughout the summer months. 
Even if the virus does dissipate with warmer weather, there is also a chance it could return when the weather cools again in the fall and winter. <SEP> Will the COVID-19 outbreak stop when the weather gets warmer? <EOS>
You can safely provide care for that animal by following the same guidance as outlined above (see “We have a request to board / care for an animal owned by a person with COVID-19. How do I keep my employees and other animals safe?”).
Companion animals presenting with illness or injury should receive veterinary care. Where appropriate, testing for infectious diseases that commonly cause companion animal illness should be conducted. If staff observe a new, concerning illness that cannot be otherwise explained, and the companion animal has had close contact with a person with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection, or an animal diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2, the supervising veterinarian should contact the state public health veterinarian or designated health official to discuss whether or not there is a need to test that animal for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 in people. Neither the CDC, USDA, nor AVMA recommends that companion animals be routinely tested for SARS-CoV-2 at this time.
For more information, see:

AVMA: Interim recommendations for intake of companion animals from households where humans with COVID-19 are present

No, do NOT wear a cloth mask in the water. It can be difficult to breathe through a cloth mask when it is wet. Plus, wet cloth masks don’t slow the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 as well as dry cloth masks. All of this means it is particularly important to stay at least 6 feet apart in the water from people you don’t live with.
In case cloth masks do get wet by mistake, bring a second (or extra) cloth mask for everyone heading out to the public pool or beach. <SEP> Can cloth masks be worn in the water? <EOS>
The following contingency and crisis strategies are based upon these assumptions:

Facilities understand their facemask inventory and supply chain
Facilities understand their facemask utilization (burn) rate
Facilities have reported supply chain issues to the Regional Healthcare Coalition. The coalition may be able to leverage existing resources.
Facilities have already implemented other engineering and administrative control measures including:

Reducing the number of patients going to the hospital or outpatient settings
Excluding HCPs not essential for patient care from entering their care area
Reducing face-to-face HCP encounters with patients
Excluding visitors to patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19
Cohorting patients and HCPs
Maximizing use of telemedicine



Additional strategies include:

Selectively cancel elective and non-urgent procedures and appointments for which a facemask is typically used by a HCP
Remove facemasks for visitors in public areas. Facemasks can be available to provide to symptomatic patients upon check in at entry points. All facemasks should be placed in a secure and monitored site. This is especially important in high-traffic areas like emergency departments.
Implement extended use of facemasks.
Restrict facemasks to use by HCPs, rather than patients for source control

Viruses normally enter into a cell and “hijack” some of the cell’s machinery to make more virus particles. This process is called replication. Sometimes, this process does not make an exact copy of the virus and a change occurs when the virus is making a genetic copy. This change is called a mutation. Most mutations don’t really cause the virus to change very much. Occasionally, mutations can lead to changes that alter a virus’ ability to infect a host, survive in the environment, or affect its ability to cause a range of symptoms associated with the virus. <SEP> What does it mean when a virus mutates? <EOS>
Yes, that’s a good idea because cell phones are basically “petri dishes in our pockets” when you think about how many surfaces you touch before touching your phone.
You should regularly disinfect your mobile phone anyway, with or without a coronavirus pandemic. 
“There’s probably quite a lot of microorganisms on there, because you’re holding them against your skin, you are handling them all the time, and also you’re speaking into them,” said Mark Fielder, a professor of medical microbiology at Kingston University. 
“And speaking does release droplets of water just in normal speech. So it’s likely that a range of microbes – including Covid-19, should you happen to be infected with that virus – might end up on your phone.”
Watch the best ways to disinfect your cell phone here. <SEP> Should we clean our cell phones daily? <EOS>
Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19 than adults.

People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth, which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. <SEP> How is COVID-19 transmitted? <EOS>

See the ECDC daily situation update for the latest available numbers. <SEP> 7. How many people have been infected in the EU/EEA? <EOS>
Outdoor gatherings lower risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the University of Leicester.
And, since it’s summer, outside is fun. Picnics are a great way to share a meal with friends — just bring separate blankets and utensils, and sit far enough apart. If you don’t want to cook, takeout and delivery are safe, and will support the local economy. Getting around can be tough without a car, but there are ways to protect yourself on public transportation, if you need to take it. <SEP> Why is it safer to spend time together outside? <EOS>
The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. Six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet.
But some scientists have looked at studies of air flow and are concerned about smaller particles called aerosols. They suggest that people consider a number of factors, including their own vulnerability and whether they are outdoors or in an enclosed room, when deciding whether six feet is enough distance.
Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study.
It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart. <SEP> Why is six feet away the right distance? <EOS>
No, this policy applies to all personnel who travel or have recently traveled. However, the actions we expect our leaders and people to take are dependent upon their travel routes and locations.

What supports are available for NJ manufacturers and small wholesalers?
$3.5 million in funding is available on a first-come, first-served basis to be used by Designated Vendors to subsidize 20% of the purchase price of PPE that has either (i) been manufactured in New Jersey or (ii) been distributed by a wholesaler with less than 25 full time equivalent employees ("FTEs") located in one of New Jersey's 715 Opportunity Zone Eligible census tracts.
When will the funding for this part of the program become available? When will it end?
The manufacturing and small wholesaler support aspects of the program will become available upon launch of each Designated Vendor's PPE Access Program e-commerce site (targeted in early September) and will end on Dec 30, 2020.
Is this funding support available to all NJ manufacturers?
Funding support will be available to all entities that manufacture or do a material amount of final assembly of PPE here in New Jersey. Repackaging goods does not qualify as manufacturing or assembly under the Program.
Is this funding support available to all NJ small wholesalers? What exactly does "small" mean?
To qualify for funding support as a small wholesaler under the PPE Access Program, a company must be located in one of New Jersey's 715 Opportunity Zone Eligible census tracts and have fewer than 25 FTEs.
How do I know if I am in one of these Opportunity Zones? How can I find out if I am?
There is a simple online tool for determining if you're located in an Opportunity Zone. You can access it here. Note that it is the business address that counts, not the owner's home address (unless you are a home-based business).
How will the funding support work? Will we have to claim reimbursement from NJEDA?
The funding support will be channeled through the PPE Access Program Designated Vendors. Manufacturers and small wholesalers will not have to apply directly to NJEDA.
How do I register for or make my products known to the PPE Access Program's Designated Vendors?

Coronavirus cannot travel very far in the air, the World Health Organization says.
The virus is mainly spread through small droplets from an infected person’s nose or mouth, which get released when a person coughs, sneezes or speaks. 
These droplets “are relatively heavy, do not travel far and quickly sink to the ground,” the WHO said. 
While the wind isn’t a big risk factor, contaminated surfaces are. Those respiratory droplets can land on surfaces such as tables, doorknobs and handrails — and subsequently infect others who touch those surfaces and later touch their eyes, nose or mouth. <SEP> Can coronavirus travel by wind?

Based on what we know now, VDH recommends taking everyday actions to prevent children from getting COVID-19. These actions including washing hands often with soap and water, avoiding people who are sick, practicing social distancing between your child and other people, having children 2 years and older wear cloth masks when in public settings when it is difficult to keep 6 feet from others, covering coughs and sneezes, frequent cleaning of surfaces that are touched often, and close monitoring of your child’s health. <SEP> What does VDH recommend to parents to protect  their children? <EOS>
You should wear a cloth face covering or mask whenever you are in a public setting, according to the thirteenth modification of the State of Emergency declaration. This is to protect others from the risk of getting infected. Public settings include grocery stores, convenience stores, pharmacies, doctor’s offices, and public transportation. Businesses and services can refuse entry to individuals who do not have a face covering. Delawareans are urged to use cloth face coverings and reserve medical-grade masks for use by health care workers and first responders. Delawareans wearing a face covering should practice strict hand-washing before and after touching the face covering, according to the Delaware Division of Public Health (DPH).
Face coverings are NOT a replacement for washing hands, practicing physical distancing, and staying home. Delawareans who are sick should wear a face covering over their nose and mouth if they must be around other people – even while at home.
Governor Carney’s order does not require children aged 12 or younger to wear a face covering. Any child 2-years-old or younger MUST NOT wear a face covering, due to the risk of suffocation.”
The use of face masks is also crucial for health workers and other people who are taking care of someone infected with COVID-19 in close settings (at home or in a health care facility). Read more about Guidance for Face Coverings. <SEP> Should I wear a mask to prevent catching coronavirus disease? <EOS>
People who are engaged in high intensity activities, like running, may not be able to wear a cloth face covering if it causes difficulty breathing. If unable to wear a cloth face covering, consider conducting the activity in a location with greater ventilation and air exchange (for instance, outdoors versus indoors) and where it is possible to maintain physical distance from others.

While everyone is at risk for getting COVID-19, some people are at higher risk for getting very sick from the virus.
People 65 years old and older have an increased risk of developing serious illness if they get sick with COVID-19. Strong evidence also suggests that people of any age with certain medical conditions have an increased risk of getting very sick from COVID-19. Those conditions are chronic kidney disease, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), obesity, serious heart conditions, sickle cell disease, type 2 diabetes, and a weakened immune system from an organ transplant. For the most up-to-date information, see the People Who Need to Take Extra Precautions section of the CDC website. The CDC is learning more about COVID-19 every day and will update this section of their website as more information becomes available.
If you are in a high-risk category, call your doctor as soon as you get sick and get their advice before you go anywhere. If you can’t breathe or have severe chest pain, call 911 and/or immediately go to the ER.
Some people who become infected may not show symptoms, yet they can still spread the virus to others. Therefore, everyone should take precautions to avoid becoming infected and infecting others.
If you are sick or are caring for someone who is sick, you can use the COVID-19 Self-Checker on the DSHS Texas Health Trace application to help you make decisions about seeking appropriate medical care. <SEP> Who’s at high risk for serious illness from COVID‑19? <EOS>
Both takeout and delivery are safer than eating in restaurants, because social distancing is possible. And, good news, packaging has a low risk of transmitting the disease. Although the C.D.C. says that surfaces contaminated with droplets of the virus can infect people, the agency notes that it is “not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.”
Delivery, though, is slightly safer because of contactless delivery, which lets workers leave food at your door, said Ben Chapman, a professor and food safety specialist at North Carolina State University. Since the ordering and payment can be done electronically, customers and workers never need to touch.
If you choose to pick your food up, ask the restaurant staff member to put the food down and walk away before you pick it up. Wear a mask. Stand far apart from other patrons. And whether you choose takeout or delivery, try to pay in advance. You can do it electronically, which will keep both you and the workers safer. <SEP> What should I consider when ordering food? <EOS>
In areas where the virus that causes COVID-19 is circulating, staff aged 60 or over, or who have any underlying health conditions such as heart disease, diabetes or lung cancer, should wear a medical mask because of their higher risk of getting seriously ill from COVID-19. Staff under the age of 60 and who are in general good health can wear fabric masks when they cannot guarantee at least a 1 metre distance from others. This is particularly important for staff who are in close contact or potential close contact with others. Everyone should follow local policies and regulations. <SEP> Should staff wear a mask while working? <EOS>

It is indeed difficult to interact with populations that are disconnected from many of the information streams the rest of us are swimming in – which means that you need to make a special effort to make sure that you reach them. Convene a local group to help you figure out what mechanisms you can use to get out reliable, regular information that people will trust to the vulnerable people at the periphery where your ordinary communications don’t reach. (Dutch Leonard, 4/3/20)
Sometimes the most effective mode of communication is good old-fashioned paper—just three or four bullet points that can be communicated by a trusted health practitioner. The sequence, repetition, and consistency of messaging is important for elderly populations. In addition, ensure that family members are kept in the communication loop either through emails or mailings. Their confidence in your capabilities will provide additional support. (Juliette Kayyem, 4/1/20)
It’s so important to protect older adults in the community. Nursing homes should implement a range of recommended policies, including keeping individuals apart, isolating people who are sick, and screening staff for symptoms. Nursing homes may require investments in extra staff or new technology.
There needs to be a public health response that monitors for potential infections anywhere that elderly people are living in close quarters and intervenes immediately with testing, isolation, infection control, and quarantine. (Dr. Josh Sharfstein, 4/4/20)
As we are now seeing, elderly people who live in high-density residential facilities like nursing homes are especially vulnerable because their residential situation provides opportunities for transmission and their age and/or underlying medical conditions makes them differentially likely to develop severe, potentially lethal symptoms. Seniors in these facilities should not be gathering in groups for recreation or meals (or for any other reason!). This means even more isolation for these people, and we can’t just tell them to stay alone in their rooms – you need to provide new mechanisms for them to remain socially engaged even while physically isolated. This is particularly difficult because many of them will not have the devices and technology skills that others are using to stay connected even while distant. Again, develop a local group to invent new methods of interaction that can work for them.

COVID-19 can cause mild to severe illness. This can result in someone being admitted to the hospital and even an intensive care unit. It can even cause death. People who are infected often have symptoms of illness. Older adults and people of any age who have certain underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. This includes people with serious heart conditions, severe obesity, diabetes, chronic kidney disease (or undergoing dialysis), liver disease, chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma, or people who have a weakened immune system (immunocompromised). Everyone can take actions, such as social distancing, to help slow the spread. <SEP> Who is most at risk for severe illness from COVID-19? <EOS>

The risk of transmitting or spreading SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, during vacuuming is unknown. In order to reduce the need for cleaning, disinfection, and vacuuming, consider removing area rugs completely, if possible. At this time, there are no reported cases of COVID-19 associated with vacuuming. If vacuuming is necessary or required in a school, business, or community facility that was used by a person with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, first follow the CDC recommendations for Cleaning and Disinfection for Community Facilities that apply, which includes a wait time of 24 hours, or as long as practical.
After cleaning and disinfection, the following recommendations may help reduce the risk to workers and other individuals when vacuuming:

Use a vacuum equipped with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter, if available.
Do not vacuum a room or space that has people in it. Wait until the room or space is empty to vacuum, such as at night, for common spaces, or during the day for private rooms.
Wear disposable gloves to clean and disinfect. For soft (porous) surfaces, such as carpeted floors or rugs, clean the surface using soap and water or with cleaners appropriate for use on these surfaces, according to the textile’s label. After cleaning, disinfect with an appropriate EPA-registered disinfectant on List N: Disinfectants for use against SARS-CoV-2external icon. Soft and porous materials, like carpet, are generally not as easy to disinfect as hard and non-porous surfaces. EPA has listed a limited number of products approved for disinfection for use on soft and porous materials on List N. Follow the disinfectant manufacturer’s safety instructions (such as wearing gloves and ensuring adequate ventilation), concentration level, application method and contact time. Allow sufficient drying time if vacuum is not intended for wet surfaces.

Steps to prevent the spread of the flu will also help guard
  against the spread of COVID-19: cover your cough and sneezes,
  wash your hands frequently, avoid shaking hands and touching your
  face with unwashed hands, and if you are not feeling well or are
  experiencing a cold, the flu, or other symptoms, contact your
  primary care provider and stay home from school or work. Take
  steps to improve your personal and organizational preparedness.
  Refer to the coronavirus section of our website for more
  information.


  Individuals can prevent illness by taking the following actions:


Frequently wash hands with soap and water for at least 20
  seconds;
  
Always cover your cough or sneeze;
  
Stay home if you are sick;
  
Get your flu shot to protect against the flu or symptoms
  similar to COVID-19; and
  
If you have recently returned from a country with ongoing
  COVID-19 infection, monitor your health and follow the
  instructions of public health officials.
  


  Individuals can prepare for the disruption that outbreaks cause:


Make sure you have a supply of all essential medications for
  your family;
  
Make a child care plan if you or a caregiver are sick;
  
Consider how your family will manage school closures; and
  
Consider how you can care for a sick family member without
  getting sick yourself. <SEP> WHAT ACTIONS CAN WE TAKE TO PREVENT AND PREPARE FOR CORONAVIRUS? <EOS>
The safety of our patients and caregivers remains our top priority. We want to assure patients that our Cleveland Clinic facilities are safe for them to receive care.
We have taken steps to increase safety by:

Limiting visitors to our facilities.
Screening everyone for potential COVID-19 symptoms.
Providing essential personal protective equipment (PPE) for caregivers.
Practicing physical distancing.
Expanding testing capabilities.
Continuing to clean and disinfect surfaces frequently.
Requiring our caregivers to wear face shields and masks in clinical areas.
Requiring permitted visitors to wear masks at all times while inside our facilities, unless they have a health or behavioral condition that prevents them from wearing one.
Requiring patients to wear a mask for all routine appointments and procedures (without a hospital stay), and in the Emgergency Department, unless they have a health or behavioral condition that prevents them from wearing one.
Strongly encouraging hospitalized patients to wear a mask inside our facilities.

What are Cleveland Clinic’s mask guidelines?
As we learn more about COVID-19 and its transmission, we are adapting our practices in order to provide the safest care to our patients and protect our caregivers. In alignment with guidelines from the CDC and direction from our state and local governments, are requiring all caregivers in all our locations to wear face masks while inside our facilities.
Face masks are required for patients at all routine appointments and procedures (without a hospital stay), Emergency Department patients and for permitted visitors. Face masks are strongly encouraged for patients admitted to the hospital and Emergency Department patients, unless they have a health or behavioral condition that prevents them from wearing one. Patients and permitted visitors will be given a mask to wear the entire time they are in our facilities. They may choose to bring their own masks from home. Wearing a mask is not only an effort to protect yourself, but also to help protect others. <SEP> I have an appointment at Cleveland Clinic and I am concerned about COVID-19.

With the exception of the organisations listed in this guidance on closing businesses and venues, the government has not required any other businesses to close to the public – it is important for business to carry on.
It is at the discretion of employers as to how staff can continue working safely. Working from home is one way to do this, but workplaces can also be made safe by following COVID-19 Secure guidelines. Your employer should consult with you on how you can work safely, and must ensure workplaces are safe if they are asking you to return, as above.
If you are clinically extremely vulnerable, you can go to work as long as the workplace is Covid-19 Secure but should carry on working from home wherever possible.
There is specific guidance for those showing symptoms that should be observed when considering adjustments to enable people to go back to work. <SEP> 5.1 Who is allowed to go to work? <EOS>
While many businesses have introduced working from home and teleworking, these are not options for food workers who are required to continue to work as normal. Keeping all workers in the food production and supply chains healthy and safe is critical to avoid food shortage. Maintaining the movement of food along the food chain is an essential function of all sectors of the food industry and is extremely important for ensuring consumer confidence in the food supply. In order to ensure that the food supply chain remains intact to prevent food shortages there is an urgent requirement for the industry to introduce additional measures to protect food workers from contracting COVID-19; to prevent the risk of exposure to COVID-19, and to strengthen existing food hygiene and sanitation practices. <SEP> How do we ensure the food supply chain remains intact to prevent food shortages? <EOS>

There is no evidence about the relationship between e-cigarette use and COVID-19. However, existing evidence indicates that electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) and electronic non-nicotine delivery systems (ENNDS), more commonly referred to as e-cigarettes, are harmful and increase the risk of heart disease and lung disorders.  Given that the COVID-19 virus affects the respiratory tract, the hand-to-mouth action of e-cigarette use  may increase the risk of infection. <SEP> As a vaper, am I more likely to be infected or to have more severe symptoms if infected? <EOS>
The virus doesn’t discriminate - everyone is at risk of getting COVID-19. Some people are more likely than others to become severely ill, which means that they may require hospitalization, intensive care, or a ventilator to help them breathe.

CDPH recommends face masks (or face shields for very young children) at age 2 or older, so that those who cannot manage masks can nonetheless be protected. CDPH guidance requires all children in 3rd grade or later to wear masks. Increasing evidence suggests wearing masks or face coverings can significantly decrease COVID-19 disease transmission. Other countries' experiences (e.g., China, Singapore) suggests that virtually all students can be taught to handle face coverings at that age.
Schools should review the CDPH Guidance for the Use of Face Coverings (PDF) and any applicable local health department guidance and incorporate face covering use for students and workers into their COVID-19 prevention plan. <SEP> The American Academy of Pediatrics does not recommend masks or face coverings for students under middle school age.

We've known for some time that masks help prevent people from spreading the coronavirus to others. Based on an analysis of existing information, a new study contends that masks may also protect mask wearers from becoming infected themselves.Different masks, writes the study author, block viral particles to varying degrees. If masks lead to lower "doses" of virus being inhaled, then fewer people may become infected, and those who do may have milder illness.Researchers in China experimented with hamsters to test the effect of masks. They put healthy hamsters and hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2 (the COVID-19 coronavirus) in a cage, and separated some of the healthy and infected hamsters with a barrier made of surgical masks. Many of the "masked" healthy hamsters did not get infected, and those who did got less sick than previously healthy "maskless" hamsters.A similar experiment cannot ethically be done in humans. But researchers have studied doses of flu virus and found that people who inhaled a higher dose of flu virus were more likely to get sick and experience symptoms. Observations of coronavirus outbreaks in processing plants and on cruise ships also support the idea that masks may help protect mask wearers.Without more research, we can't be certain that masks protect the wearer. But we do know they don't hurt, and that they protect others. <SEP> Who do masks protect: the wearer, others, or both? <EOS>
Singapore was initially praised for its clampdown on the virus. Even people who had no symptoms but tested positive had to be hospitalized until they tested negative. 
But Singapore was also relaxed, allowing businesses, churches, restaurants and schools to stay open during its first wave of the virus. And some communities were overlooked by government testing.
The number of cases in Singapore shot up, and the country suffered a strong second wave of coronavirus. 
By contrast, Germany, South Korea, Iceland and Taiwan have been able to suppress the virus. They also have among the lowest death rates from Covid-19 in the world. 
Taiwan was proactive, launching its Central Epidemic Command Center before the island even confirmed its first infection. 
Iceland required all its citizens returning to the country to undergo 14 days of quarantine – regardless of which country they traveled from.
Germany and South Korea quickly launched widespread testing and have some of the highest per-capita testing rates in the world. Their ability to identify and isolate those infected has helped prevent deadlier outcomes. <SEP> What can we learn from how other countries handled coronavirus? <EOS>
A study published in The New England Journal of Medicine found that people with Type A blood have a higher risk of getting infected with coronavirus and developing severe symptoms, while people with Type O blood have a lower risk – but the study has caveats.
The researchers cannot say if blood type is a direct cause of the differences in susceptibility. It could be that genetic changes that affect someone’s risk also just happen to be linked with blood type, they said.
The study’s findings, while plausible, may mean very little for the average person, said Dr. Roy Silverstein, a hematologist and chairman of the department of medicine at the Medical College of Wisconsin.
“The absolute difference in risk is very small,” he said. “The risk reduction may be statistically significant, but it is a small change in actual risk. You never would tell somebody who was Type O that they were at smaller risk of infection.”
The bottom line: “All of us are susceptible to this virus,” said Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, technical lead for the World Health Organization’s Covid-19 response. <SEP> Are some blood types able to fight coronavirus better than other blood types? <EOS>

We must look at data, not dates. Three preconditions must be met before a city can begin to gradually “open the faucet.” There are (1) falling case and death rates; (2) a health care system that can withstand a small outbreak without risk to workers and patients; and (3) a public health capacity to: test to identify people newly infected with coronavirus, isolate those who test positive, trace contacts who may have been exposed to people with active infections, and quarantine those individuals. I recommend creating a corps of trained contact tracers—possibly as many as one for every 1,000 residents—to locate potentially exposed individuals and support them through a fourteen-day quarantine. Watch for the CDC to publish guidelines in the near future.
Even with a strong public health response, the faucet has to be loosened slowly. The medically vulnerable should continue to stay home. Set priorities according to societal benefit and take measures to reduce risk, such as temperature checks and symptom checklists for workers, mandatory hand hygiene measures, and maintenance/use of sensor-operated doors and fixtures. Plan on tightening the faucet quickly if you see another spike in cases. (Dr. Tom Frieden, 4/14/2020) <SEP> How long should social distancing last? <EOS>

Yes, COVID-19 is a new disease. While more information becomes available every day, many questions about transmission remain. A vast effort by research teams and networks around the world is underway to answer those questions.  WHO and our partners are working to gain a better understanding about: different transmission routes, including through droplets of different sizes, physical contact, fomites, and the role of airborne transmission in the absence of aerosol generating procedures; the dose of virus required for transmission to occur; the characteristics of people and situations that facilitate superspreading events such as those observed in some closed settings; the proportion of infected people who remain asymptomatic throughout the course of their infection; the proportion of truly asymptomatic persons who transmit the virus to others; the specific factors that drive asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission;and the proportion of all infections transmitted from asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals. <SEP> Is more information needed to better understand COVID-19 transmission? <EOS>
There is some evidence to suggest that vitamin D might help protect against becoming infected with, and developing serious symptoms of, COVID-19. We know, for example, that people with low vitamin D levels may be more susceptible to upper respiratory tract infections. One meta-analysis found that people who took vitamin D supplements, particularly those who had low vitamin D levels, were less likely to develop acute respiratory tract infections than those who didn't.Vitamin D may protect against COVID-19 in two ways. First, it may help boost our bodies' natural defense against viruses and bacteria. Second, it may help prevent an exaggerated inflammatory response, which has been shown to contribute to severe illness in some people with COVID-19.Our bodies make vitamin D when exposed to sunshine. Five to 10 minutes of sun exposure on some or most days of the week to the arms, legs, or back without sunscreen will enable you to make enough of the vitamin. Good food sources of vitamin D include fatty fish (such as tuna, mackerel, and salmon), foods fortified with vitamin D (such as dairy products, soy milk, and cereals), cheese, and egg yolks.The recommended dietary dose of vitamin D is 600 IU each day for adults 70 and younger and 800 IU each day for adults over 70. A daily supplement containing 1,000 to 2,000 IU of vitamin D is likely safe for most people. For adults, the risk of harmful effects increases above 4,000 IU per day. <SEP> Does vitamin D protect against COVID-19? <EOS>
It's important to have domestic violence shelters for people who are not safe at home. It's also important to help families address stress in these incredibly stressful circumstances.

“People can be contagious without symptoms. And in fact – a little bit strangely in this case — people tend to be the most contagious before they develop symptoms, if they’re going to develop symptoms,” CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said.
“They call that the pre-symptomatic period. So people tend to have more virus at that point seemingly in their nose, in their mouth. This is even before they get sick. And they can be shedding that virus into the environment.”
Some people infected with coronavirus never get symptoms. But it’s easy for these asymptomatic carriers to infect others, said Dr. Anne Rimoin, an epidemiology professor at UCLA’s School of Public Health.
“When you speak, sometimes you’ll spit a little bit,” she said. “You’ll rub your nose. You’ll touch your mouth. You’ll rub your eyes. And then you’ll touch other surfaces, and then you will be spreading virus if you are infected and shedding asymptomatically.”

Testing data from Boston showed that a third of unhoused people in the city’s shelters had coronavirus infections—in many cases without symptoms. This should worry other cities. People experiencing homelessness need facilities that allow for good sanitation, handwashing, and social distancing. Working with universities to utilize dormitory space or with the business community to create new shelter spaces or tents for hospital testing sites could be helpful. We need to be able to isolate and track people who test positive and care for them if they become acutely ill, which was tough before this pandemic started and is tougher now.

Masks, frequent cleaning and keeping physical distance are all helpful, but it's going to be hard to control the spread as long as people are in big rooms and moving around. Look for ways to switch models so that you have people in more individual units. (Dr. Josh Sharfstein, 4/21/20)
Going forward, there’s a risk that if unstably housed people go back to the streets or into shelters with less health support and space for physical distancing, there could be a new outbreak.

Leave extra time to do a quick symptoms check. If anyone in your house has any
               symptoms of COVID-19, even mild ones, don't send your kids to school. Know the person

You should follow the advice of your travel company. If the type of mask is not specified then people 60 years and over, and those who have underlying health conditions, should wear a medical mask while traveling. This provides greater protection from others who may have the virus.People who feel healthy and have no symptoms can wear a fabric mask to prevent any virus they may have from spreading to others. Remember that wearing a mask does not provide full protection. You should always combine this with frequent hand cleaning, covering a cough or sneeze with a bent elbow or tissue, and maintaining at least a 1 metre distance from others wherever possible.Find out how to choose and wear a mask here. <SEP> The travel company is asking me to wear a mask while traveling.

Travel increases your chance of getting and spreading COVID-19. COVID-19 risk in most countries is high, and travelers should avoid nonessential travel to high-risk destinations. Travelers at increased risk for severe illness should consider postponing all travel, including essential travel, to high-risk destinations. To check a destination’s COVID-19 risk level see COVID-19 Travel Recommendations by Destination.
Some healthcare systems are overwhelmed and there may be limited access to adequate medical care in affected areas. Many countries are implementing travel restrictions and mandatory quarantines, closing borders, and prohibiting non-citizens from entry with little advance notice. If you choose to travel internationally, your travel plans may be disrupted. If you get sick or are exposed to a person with COVID-19 during your trip, you may be isolated or quarantined and your return to the United States may be delayed.
CDC also recommends all travelers defer all cruise ship travel worldwide. <SEP> Where are the high-risk travel areas? <EOS>
Yes, you can. It helps if you use a medical face mask but these simpler masks are for you if you cannot afford any form of medical face mask. <SEP> Can I use it outside during shopping? <EOS>
The Virginia Board of Pharmacy has issued emergency provisions which authorize pharmacists to exercise judgement and authorize an early refill. Provisions differ depending on the schedule of the drug. More information can be found here.
Pharmacists should encourage providers to write for 90 days supplies when clinically appropriate. Mail-order services or pharmacy delivery services should be recommended to patients, specifically high-risk patients. If delivery is not available, drive through services or curbside medication pick-up are preferred. Social distancing should be enforced in medication pick-up areas. <SEP> Are there special provisions for dispensing of new prescriptions or refills during the state of emergency? <EOS>
OSHA does not require employers to notify other employees if one of their coworkers gets COVID-19. However, employers must take appropriate steps to protect other workers from exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in the workplace. These steps might  include specific actions as a result of a confirmed case, such as cleaning and disinfecting  the work environment, notifying other workers to monitor themselves for signs/symptoms  of COVID-19, or implementing a screening program in the workplace (e.g., for signs/symptoms  of COVID-19 among workers).
The CDC Guidance for Business and Employers recommends employers determine which  employees may have been exposed to the virus and inform employees of their  possible exposure to COVID-19 in the workplace. However, employers should maintain  confidentiality as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and the  information disclosed and method of disclosure must comply with applicable  federal, state, and local laws.
Employers and workers can visit the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's COVID-19 webpage and frequently asked questions to learn more about this topic. <SEP> Is an employer required to notify other  employees if a worker gets COVID-19 or tests positive COVID-19? <EOS>
 Yes, but they are subject to social distancing and sanitation rules and guidelines. Organizers of day and overnight summer camps are required to comply with rules listed in the Safer at Home health order. In addition to complying with the health order, they are strongly encouraged to follow the Guidelines for Day and Overnight Youth Summer Camps. <SEP>  Are day and overnight summer camps allowed to operate? <EOS>
If taking part in activities with larger groups, you should take particular care to follow social distancing guidelines. In addition to those guidelines, the following principles should be observed to ensure you meet people in a way that minimises the risk of spreading infection:

limit the time you spend interacting with people from outside your household or support bubble to the activity which you are partaking in
limit the number of different activities which you partake in succession to reduce the potential chain of transmission
follow strict social distancing guidelines from people outside your household or support bubble
group size should be limited to the minimum which allows the activity to take place
if organising an activity, you should carry out a COVID-19 risk assessment to identify actions which could minimise the risk of transmission. Employers have a legal responsibility to protect workers and others from risk to their health and safety <SEP> 2.10 How can I stay safe if I am part of a larger gathering? <EOS>
The Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat’s Telework Policy states that costs incurred as a result of working remotely are the employees’ responsibility. There have been no decisions specific to the Department of National Defence pertaining to reimbursements due to the nature of the current remote work posture or for future instances of reactivation of Business Continuity Plans. Defence Team members will be provided updates via the ADM (PA) external website as well as the HRGO App and Defence Team news, as they become available.

Medicaid: It depends. The cash received through unemployment insurance is  typically counted as income under the Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI). However,  the Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (PUC), i.e. $600 weekly additional  payment enacted by the CARES Act, is not taken into account when determining  eligibility for Medicaid.
Supplemental  Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP): Yes. Both  unemployment insurance and the PUC are counted as unearned income for the  purpose of SNAP eligibility. 
Cash Assistance: Yes. Both unemployment insurance and the PUC are taken into account  as unearned income when applying for Cash Assistance.

No. Even if you feel fine, you’re still at risk of passing the virus to the people around you. Rest and recover at home for 10 days, which should give your body enough time to beat the illness. After this 10-day period, ask your doctor if you need to get re-tested for COVID-19 as an extra precaution.  If you’ve come in contact with your friends and family as an asymptomatic carrier, encourage them to quarantine themselves at home for 2 weeks, just to be safe. <SEP> Can you go outside if you’re asymptomatic? <EOS>
Symptoms can appear between 2-14 days after exposure, though some people may not have any symptoms while still being contagious. It's also important to consider whether you've been in contact with an infected person, as well as any symptoms you may be experiencing. If you believe you've been infected and you are not in immediate danger, you should contact your doctor by phone. If you are experiencing a medical emergency, call 911, and notify the dispatch personnel that you may have COVID-19.
Drafted: 10 March 2020 <SEP> If I get infected, when do symptoms appear? <EOS>
Whether screening is conducted depends on the country policies and its risk benefit analysis. Exit and entry screening includes measures like temperature checking and checking for signs and symptoms (fever above 38°C, cough).  You may be asked to complete a form informing health authorities about your possible exposure to cases within the last two weeks (contact with patients among health care workers, visits to hospitals, sharing accommodation with a person sick with COVID-19, etc.). Symptomatic travellers and identified contacts will be asked to have a medical examination and be tested for COVID- 19. You should not be charged for these protective measures, including any required isolation and quarantine. <SEP> Could I be screened when I exit or arrive at my destination? <EOS>
​No. If you are offered work by your employer and refuse to accept it, without good cause, you may no longer be eligible for UC. Determining whether there was good cause for a refusal of work is driven by the facts of each claimant’s circumstances. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, examples of good cause may include:  an employer violates the Governor’s and Secretary of Health’s business closure orders and opens their business prematurely, or the person is at high risk of complications from the virus and their employer cannot make reasonable accommodations for them.  UC staff would review those specific reasons and make determinations based on the facts of their individual cases. <SEP> ​​My employer offered me my job back but I would make more staying on Unemployment.  Can I do this? <EOS>
The following adaptations to transport to and from school should be implemented to limit unnecessary exposure of school or staff members.Promote and put in place respiratory and hand hygiene, physical distancing measures and use of masks in transportation such as school buses, in accordance with local policy.Provide tips for how to safely commute to and from school, including for public transportation.Organize only one child per seat and ensure physical distancing of at least 1 metre between passengers in school buses, if possible. This may require more school buses per school.If possible and safe, keep the windows of the buses, vans, and other vehicles open. <SEP> What are the risks during transportation to and from schools? <EOS>
 We highly recommend that, when feasible, both Health Plans and FFS Programs and providers leverage technological platforms to conduct virtual visits whenever possible.

The Florida Department of Health follows CDC guidance on testing for COVID-19. This means that when a person goes to their local health care provider they will be asked the following questions:

Did you have close contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19 and are experiencing symptoms?
Are you located in an area where there is confirmed community spread?
Are you experiencing unexplained respiratory illness that requires hospitalization?
Have you traveled to or from an affected geographic area with community transmission in the last 14 days and have a fever or symptoms of lower respiratory illness?

If the answer is yes to any of those questions, that person will be tested. Additionally, a person can be tested at the discretion of their local health care provider if they do not meet the above criteria.

It is natural to feel stress, anxiety, grief, and worry during and after a disaster. Everyone reacts differently, and your own feelings will change over time. Notice and accept how you feel. Taking care of your emotional health during an emergency will help you think clearly and react to the urgent needs to protect yourself and your family. Self-care during an emergency will help your long-term healing.
Take the following steps to cope with a disaster:

Take care of your body– Try to eat healthy well-balanced meals, exercise regularly, and get plenty of sleep. Avoid alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs.
Connect with others– Share your concerns and how you are feeling with a friend or family member. Maintain healthy relationships, and build a strong support system.
Take breaks– Make time to unwind and remind yourself that strong feelings will fade. Try taking in deep breaths. Try to do activities you usually enjoy.
Stay informed– When you feel that you are missing information, you may become more stressed or nervous. Watch, listen to, or read the news for updates from officials. Always check your sources and turn to reliable sources of information like your local government authorities.
Avoid too much exposure to news– Take breaks from watching, reading, or listening to news stories. It can be upsetting to hear about the crisis and see images repeatedly. Try to do enjoyable activities and return to normal life as much as possible and check for updates between breaks.
Seek help when needed– If distress impacts activities of your daily life for several days or weeks, talk to a clergy member, counselor, or doctor, or contact the SAMHSA (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration) helpline at 1-800-985-5990.
For victims and survivors of abuse who need support, the National Domestic Violence Hotline is available 24/7. Call 1-800-799-7233 or 1-800-799-7233 for TTY.

We know that wearing masks can help prevent the spread of coronavirus by blocking droplets that are emitted when someone coughs, sneezes, talks, or breathes. But which masks are best and worst?Researchers at Duke University created a simple setup that allowed them to count the number of droplet particles released when people spoke the phrase "Stay healthy, people" five times in a row. First, the study participants spoke without a mask, and then they repeated the same words, each time wearing one of 14 different types of face masks and coverings.As expected, medical grade N95 masks performed best, meaning that the fewest number of droplets got through. They were followed by surgical masks. Several masks made of polypropylene, a cotton/propylene blend, and 2-layer cotton masks sewn in different styles also performed well.Gaiters ranked dead last. Also called neck fleeces, gaiters tend to be made of lightweight fabric and are often worn by athletes. Bandanas also ranked poorly.A couple of simple tests can help you gauge the effectiveness of your mask: If you can see through your mask when you hold it up to the light, or can breathe through it easily, it's probably not doing much to prevent spread. <SEP> What types of masks are most and least effective? <EOS>
We continuously review the practices and procedures necessary to conduct training in a safe manner and CFLRS is in constant communication with our chain of command, military Health Services experts, and regional civilian health authorities concerning the prevention of COVID-19 when training resumes. Some of the preventative measures include, but are not limited to;

Ongoing health monitoring of all personnel;
Rigorous practicing of public health measures including physical distancing and proper hygiene techniques.
The issuance of non-medical masks to all members of the Defence Team for use when the maintenance of physical distancing protocols are not possible;
Ensuring all staff, instructors and students are trained on and practice the response plan to an outbreak within CFLRS or the surrounding community;
Training will, initially, resume at a reduced capacity to ensure that all involved remain safe and healthy. Capacity will increase if and only when local conditions permit this; and;
Training and students will be contained within military facilities and locations until such time as the local situation permits otherwise. <SEP> What safety measures are being implemented to protect personnel during partial resumption of training? <EOS>
There are 3 main types of masks recommended to prevent the spread of COVID-19: cloth face coverings, surgical masks, and N95 respirators. All of these help to prevent the spread of COVID-19, and any one of them can be worn in a public place to contain the droplets from your mouth. However, if you’re not a healthcare professional, you should go for a non-medical cloth mask, and save the medical-grade masks for healthcare workers. 

Masks with exhalation valves or vents, like the ones used in woodworking, are not effective against the spread of COVID-19 since they release air into your surroundings.
Cloth face masks should cover your nose and mouth completely without leaving any gaps on your chin or your cheeks. <SEP> What kind of mask is the best? <EOS>
Contact tracing is part of the overall strategy to control the spread of COVID-19 in our community. By identifying those who had close contact with someone with COVID-19, we can let them know that they should get tested and quarantine themselves. 
Case interviews and contact tracing is primarily done by Public Health – Seattle & King County with support from WA Department of Health. Most of the callers are county staff but you may receive a call from state volunteers or the National Guard.
You will be asked demographic questions about your date of birth, address, gender at birth, race and ethnicity, occupation, your COVID-19 illness, how you think you were exposed to COVID-19, places you visited, and who you have come into close contact with. Any information they collect will only be shared with public health professionals who are working to contain the virus. The caller can also help connect you to any support you might need.
You will NOT be asked about your immigration status, social security number, finances, or marital status. Do not provide this information to someone who is calling you for a case interview or contact tracing. <SEP> 14. How does Public Health track potential cases in King County? <EOS>
A; This is a new virus and we are still learning about it, but so far, there does not seem to be a lot of illness in children.  Most illness, including serious illness, is happening in adults of working age and older adults.

Encourage frequent handwashing and follow other prevention tips. <SEP>  What steps should parents take to protect children? <EOS>
There are many factors, and one is sharing staff, who may be bringing in an infection even if they do not have symptoms. That's why access to testing—especially once cases are found—is important, not just in that facility, but for all the facilities that may have shared staff over the past 14 days.
In an ideal world, we wouldn't be moving staff around between all these facilities and retroactively trying to identify where they potentially could have exposed lots of people. I'm not sure there's a solution other than dramatically expanding the workforce. It’s an issue that will come up when workers are not able to return to work and we start thinking about how to fill the gaps with volunteers. This is another reason why access to personal protective equipment and, we hope, routine screening is very important.

Comprehensive contact tracing should be implemented as soon as cases or clusters are identified. During intense transmission, contact tracing may be difficult but should be carried out as much as possible, focusing on vulnerable and household contacts, healthcare workers and high-risk closed settings (e.g., dormitories, institutions, long-term care homes and other long-term facilities). When countries have passed a peak in transmission and the numbers of sick people are decreasing, particularly when stringent public health and social measures are being adjusted, it is critical to maintain rapid identification of sick people and contact tracing. This identification and investigation break new transmission chains. <SEP> When should contact tracing be implemented? <EOS>
We recognize that there will be stress and anxiety related to returning to the workplace.
Remember, the return will be gradual and done respecting all public health measures. In the meantime, if your employees are able to perform their duties from home, you are encouraged to explore this option.
If your team must be onsite as business resumes, assure your employees that all public health advisories and measures are being implemented.
Moving into Business Resumption, there will be a need for all managers to discuss with their employees their preferences for remote work and/or return to the workplace, map employee availability against operational requirements, determine the feasibility from an infrastructure and a health and safety perspective.  Should managers authorize remote work, the Flexible Work Program assists employees and managers to understand their accountabilities and all available options – as well as the impacts and considerations – in the current environment and into the future. <SEP> I have signaled to my team that business will be resuming.

The process for reporting, collecting, and analyzing disease data may be called a data supply chain. Under state disease reporting laws hospitals, healthcare providers, and laboratories must report confirmed or probable COVID-19 cases and deaths to state or local health departments. These laws allow health departments to quickly identify outbreaks and control the spread of disease. The figure illustrates how data is transferred for case reporting (from hospitals, healthcare provider, and laboratories to local, regional, state, or territorial public health) and how data moves for case notification (from state or territorial public health to CDC). These two steps of information flow make up national case surveillance. While case reporting is mandatory under state reportable disease laws, case notification from state and local health departments to CDC includes deidentified data and is voluntary.
Using the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System, health departments voluntarily send CDC data that does not include personal, identifiable information about COVID-19 cases and deaths. Because COVID-19 has been designated as a public health emergency of international concern, CDC reports national case surveillance data to the World Health Organization under International Health Regulations (2005). CDC also publishes deidentified COVID-19 national case surveillance data with additional privacy protections for public use at data.cdc.gov. <SEP> How is COVID-19 case information collected and reported? <EOS>

Executive Order 20-81 provides a limited number of exemptions from the face covering requirements. One exemption included in EO 20-81 is: 
“Individuals at their workplace when wearing a face covering would create a job hazard for the individual or others, as determined by local, state or federal regulators or workplace safety and health standards and guidelines.” 
Whether wearing a face covering would create a job hazard to the wearer or others is going to depend on the circumstances and should be determined on a case-by-case basis. If a business identifies a specific health or safety concern about wearing a face covering, the business must then determine whether it is possible to eliminate or minimize this concern by modifying the job task, using a substitution (such as a face shield), or by putting in place engineering or administrative controls.   
A business must exhaust all possible options for eliminating or minimizing health or safety concerns before allowing a worker to work without a face covering under conditions where doing so would create a hazard.   
The following are examples of commonly raised concerns about wearing face coverings in the workplace and how they can be addressed: 

Fogging of eye protection: Fogging of eye glasses, safety glasses, or other eye protection can often be eliminated by wearing face coverings that can be adjusted to fit snugly over the nose and across the cheekbones. Fogging of eye protection while wearing a face covering can also be eliminated by using eye protection that is not susceptible to fogging, including use of face shields instead of face coverings or the use of micro-screen eye protection instead of lenses.
Discomfort while wearing in warm environments: A face covering alone does not cause a person to overheat and causes less risk of overheating than does wearing N95 masks. Before determining that wearing a face covering poses a job hazard due to the temperature of the work environment, the business must first determine whether the health or safety concerns associated with wearing a face covering in a warm environment can be addressed through other means, such as by keeping the work environment at a lower temperature, implementing engineering controls (e.g., improving ventilation and/or increasing air exchange), adopting administrative controls (e.g., scheduling additional cool-down breaks and ensuring proper hydration), or using equipment to help improve individual workers’ comfort (e.g., cooling vests). The business must also consider whether workers can use face coverings made out of material that is more comfortable to wear in warm environments and consider providing workers with more than one face covering so that they can be replaced during the work shift.
Entanglement or contamination: If wearing a face covering raises concerns about entanglement with equipment or machinery or contamination of face coverings by chemicals or dust, the business must work to eliminate the risk of entanglement or contamination rather than simply having workers remove their face coverings. Businesses may be able to eliminate risk of entanglement through engineering controls (e.g., proper machine guards) or work practices (e.g., choosing face coverings that do not have parts that can pulled into a machine, wearing a face shield over the face covering).  Similarly, businesses may be able to eliminate risk of contamination through engineering controls or providing workers with additional face covering to change as needed. 

If a business has exhausted all possible options for mitigating or eliminating a job hazard to the worker or others, a worker may remove their face covering but only when performing the specific hazardous task or tasks. <SEP> What if wearing a face covering when working would create a job hazard? <EOS>

Medical masks should only be used by:Health workersAnyone with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, including mildly ill people People caring for suspect or confirmed cases of COVID-19 outside of health facilitiesPeople aged 60 or overPeople with underlying health conditionsHow to put on and take off a medical mask:Before touching the mask, clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water  Inspect the mask for tears or holes; do not use a mask that has previously been worn or is damaged. Verify which side is the top – this is usually where the metal strip is Then, identify the inside of the mask, which is usually the white side. Place the mask on your face covering your nose, mouth and chin, making sure that there are no gaps between your face and the mask. Pinch the metal strip so it moulds to the shape of your nose. Remember, do not touch the front of the mask while using it to avoid contamination; if you accidentally touch it, clean your hands.  How to take off a medical mask:Before touching the mask, clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water  Remove the straps from behind the head or ears, without touching the front of the mask. As you remove the mask, lean forward and pull the mask away from your face.   Medical masks are for single use only; discard the mask immediately, preferably into a closed bin. Clean your hands after touching the mask.Be aware of the condition of the mask; replace it if it gets soiled or damp.When and how to use masksRemember, a mask alone cannot protect you from COVID-19. It must be combined with other measures, including maintaining at least one metre distance from each other, washing your hands frequently and avoiding touching your face while wearing a mask.Stay safe and help prevent the spread of COVID-19! <SEP> How should I use and wear a medical mask? <EOS>
Kids are less likely to catch and spread the coronavirus than adults. Health experts
               say that going to school with safeguards in place helps protect students and lowers
               their chances of getting the virus. These include:

washing hands and cleaning surfaces often
wearing masks or cloth face coverings
keeping kids spaced apart
staggered schedules
grouping the same students and teachers together throughout the school day 

If healthy kids do get coronavirus, they are less likely than adults to have symptoms
               or to get very sick. And, while worrisome to parents, the inflammatory
               disorder called multisystem inflammatory syndrome

Only patients with an appointment will be seen at the drive-up or on-site testing locations. Patients should start by calling our nurse triage hotline to schedule their appointment for testing:

954.659.5951 - Cleveland Clinic Weston Hospital (Monday – Friday, 8 a.m. - 4 p.m.)
772.419.3360 - Martin Health (Monday – Friday, 8 a.m. - 5 p.m.; Saturday - Sunday, 8 a.m. - 3 p.m.)
772.226.4846 - Indian River Hospital (Monday – Friday, 7 a.m. - 3 p.m.)

The caller will be screened by a nurse who will determine if they meet criteria for testing.
Patients who meet criteria for COVID-19 testing will be given an appointment and directed to the testing location. Anyone over the age of 16 who has a fever and respiratory illness (such as cough, runny nose, sneezing) or any patient with a fever and gastrointestinal illness (such as diarrhea, vomiting) is eligible for testing.
When patients arrive at the drive-through, they will first have their temperature taken. Patients who do not have a fever will NOT be tested. <SEP> What is the process for getting tested? <EOS>
You should follow state and local jurisdictional guidance regarding continuing operations at your facility. There have not been any reports of horses testing positive for the virus that causes COVID-19. Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading the virus that causes COVID-19 to people is considered to be very low. COVID-19 is primarily spread from person to person, so steps should be taken to reduce the risks for people visiting your facility.
 

Encourage employees and other visitors, including boarders, owners, farriers, veterinarians, and those taking lessons, not to enter the facility if they are sick.

People who have been sick should not enter the facility until the criteria to discontinue home isolation are met, after talking with their doctor.
Implement sick leave policies for employees that are flexible, nonpunitive, and consistent with public health guidance, allowing employees to stay home if they have symptoms of respiratory infection.


Consider conducting daily health checks (e.g., symptom and/or temperature screening) of employees and others visiting the facility before they enter the premises. People with a fever of 100.4℉ (38.0℃) or above, or other signs of illness should not be admitted to the premises. If implementing health checks, conduct them safely and respectfully. See our General Business page for more information.

Employees or visitors who appear to have symptoms upon arrival or who become sick during their visit should immediately be separated from other employees and visitors and sent home.


Limit the number of people entering the facility. Consider staggering lesson and visiting times to limit the number of people in the facility and the potential for person-to-person contact. You can also take steps to decrease high-traffic areas by limiting areas open to visitors/owners and staggering use of common areas like grooming or wash stalls and tack rooms.
Increase distance and limit duration of contact between employees and visitors in the facility. Whenever possible, people should maintain at least 6 feet of distance between each other at the facility, including instructors teaching lessons. Allow for social distancing and avoid large numbers of people within the facility, including in employee-only areas.
Visitors and employees should wear cloth face coverings to protect others especially where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain. Wearing a cloth face covering does NOT replace the need to practice social distancing.
Set up hand hygiene stations at the entrance and within the facility, so that employees and people entering can clean their hands before they enter. Employees should wash hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.

An alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol can be used, but if hands are visibly dirty, they should be washed with soap and water before using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
Examples of hand hygiene stations may be a hose and soap located at entrances to allow for handwashing before entry.


Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as grooming tools, halters, lead ropes, shared tack and equipment, and door handles/gates (including those to stall doors and pasture/turn out areas) on a routine basis. To disinfect, use products that meet EPA’s criteria for use against the virus that causes COVID-19 and are appropriate for the surface, diluted household bleach solutions prepared according to the manufacturer’s label for disinfection, or alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol. Follow manufacturer’s directions for use, especially regarding product contact time and protections from chemical hazards posed by cleaners and disinfectants.
Follow local guidance on shelter in place and travel recommendations when traveling for showing, training, or trail riding.
If traveling to a new facility, limit contact between people, horses, tack, equipment, and other supplies from different facilities, and maintain a distance of at least 6 feet between horses and riders.

Follow state and local guidance on travel. People who are sick should not travel to other facilities.
People visiting other facilities should follow the same precautions as they would normally, including maintaining at least 6 feet of distance between each other, wearing a cloth face covering to protect others, and washing hands frequently with soap and water.


If other animals, such as barn cats, are present at the facility, be aware that a small number of pets have been reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after contact with people with COVID-19.

No, hot water alone cannot kill the virus that causes COVID-19 on surfaces. The virus (SARS-CoV-2) has a fat-based envelope that makes it very susceptible to detergents and alcohol.
While it is likely that very high temperatures will also inactivate the virus, this is not an advised household practice due to the risk of burns and lack of testing on what temperature is needed and for how long. Soapy water or an alcohol-based disinfectant are better and easier ways to clean surfaces. Specifically, the CDC recommends alcohol (70%), diluted household bleach solutions, and EPA-registered household disinfectants. Be sure to check the labels of each product before use for proper guidance.

No. Several questions about COVID-19 immunity remain unanswered, including whether infection protects against reinfection and, if so, for how long.
Before making a decision about intentional exposure, you should consider the commitment required to remove yourself from society for 14 days, and how it will affect those around you.  One thing that is clear is that people with mild illness can transmit COVID-19 to others, who then become severely ill and, in some cases, die. Intentional exposure to COVID-19 is risky for you, and it is risky for your families, friends, and neighbors because:

We don't know if intentional exposure will provide long-term protection or protection against reinfection.
We don't know which patients will experience delayed-onset or long-term consequences of infection.
We don't know which individuals will adhere to the minimum 2-week quarantine recommended after exposure.
We don't know which secondary contacts may suffer more severe disease or outcomes.
We don't yet have a toolbox of proven treatments, nor do we have healthcare capacities prepared for large local and regional spikes in cases. <SEP> Is it beneficial to attend a “COVID-19” party to intentionally infect myself with COVID-19? <EOS>

The virus spreads largely by respiratory droplets. These spread by coughing, sneezing, or through respiratory secretions. 
The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person. Someone who is sick with COVID-19 can spread the illness to others as much as 48 hours before they have symptoms. That is why it’s so important to practice social distancing. The CDC recommends patients who have symptoms or have been diagnosed with COVID-19 should be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer a risk of infecting others.
How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with doctors, infection prevention and control experts, and public health officials and involves considering specifics of each situation including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and results of laboratory testing for that patient.
Current CDC guidance for when it is OK to release someone from isolation is made on a case by case basis and includes meeting all of the following requirements:
The patient is free from fever without the use of fever-reducing medications.
The patient is no longer showing symptoms, including cough.
Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of infection to others. <SEP> How does COVID19 spread? <EOS>

Testing is a primarily for those exposed to the virus or showing symptoms. The test has to be medically necessary and appropriate and ordered by a provider in a military hospital or clinic, or a TRICARE-authorized provider. Military medical hospitals and clinics are reserving and prioritizing COVID-19 testing for active duty service members with or without symptoms.This is part of a greater DoD strategy to reduce risk to the force.
Military hospitals and clinics won’t test beneficiaries, other than active duty, who don’t have symptoms of COVID-19 or don’t have a doctor’s order for testing.  
Testing is a way to reduce of getting the virus for certain people, but it is not the only way. You can use other measures (e.g. enhanced personal hygiene, use of facial coverings, social distancing, etc.) to help slow the spread and the need for testing.  
If I’m enrolled in TRICARE Prime Remote or TRICARE Select, what’s the policy for testing?
If you’re enrolled in TRICARE Prime Remote or are a TRICARE Select beneficiary, it’s up to your civilian provider to assess your status and determine if you need testing. They may want to first test you for other infections, flu, bacteria, and then will follow-up with the COVID-19 test if he or she feels it’s necessary. The COVID-19 Test is only being done when a provider thinks your symptoms show likely infection. The testing is free.

Effective March 18, under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, TRICARE is also waiving copays for doctor-ordered COVID 19 testing office visits.
    
The law doesn't waive copayments and cost-shares for the treatment due to infection. Copays and cost shares remain the same for TRICARE program and plans.
Under TRICARE you have fairly low out-of-pocket costs, a catastrophic cap and protection against balance billing


Active duty service members and ADFMs under Prime do not have cost-shares and so are not impacted by this law.
Due to the claims billing process and modifications, TRICARE can't immediately waive all copayments and cost-shares. Beneficiaries may have to pay up front and file a claims for reimbursement until the contractors can modify their systems.
If you receive a prescription for medication, your copay still applies. By law, TRICARE can't waive pharmacy copays. Consider filling your medication through home delivery or at a retail pharmacy depending on your MTFs operating status.

If you’re located overseas: Beneficiaries overseas with a cost-share (retirees and their family members, active duty family members (ADFMs) under TRICARE Select, and TRICARE For Life) may be eligible for cost share waivers. This is only if the COVID-19 test with the visit meets the requirements of the law. It has to be FDA approved, cleared, or authorized. Some tests used and TRICARE-covered overseas may not meet this statutory requirement. This includes the World Health Organization test, which is not currently FDA authorized.

You could skip a year, and no one would be the wiser. You could try for a socially distant park hang with friends who live near you. Or, you could host a party over video conferencing, which is really more fun than it sounds. Set a time limit, call on people the way you would if you were leading a meeting and decorate your own place. 
You could also ask everyone to bake the same easy mug cake, or something, so it feels like you’re all together. Get creative, and take the long view. Next year, you’ll be a year older. Maybe you can host one birthday party with two times the fun? 
This is, of course, harder with kids. Start by talking to them about how this year is going to be different. You might want to try for a split-level birthday: in-person activities at home with the members of your household, and online activities with friends.  
At home, you can build a fort at home together, or try for an ambitious craft project. Try some funky baking project, or give them “magic powers” for the day.
For the virtual party, keep it short and sweet. One hour is probably the maximum amount of time, so make sure you give your guests both a start time and end time. The other parents on the call will appreciate it.

At the time of preparing this Q&A, there are no peer-reviewed studies that have evaluated the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection associated with smoking. However, tobacco smokers (cigarettes, waterpipes, bidis, cigars, heated tobacco products) may be more vulnerable to contracting COVID-19, as the act of smoking involves contact of fingers (and possibly contaminated cigarettes) with the lips, which increases the possibility of transmission of viruses from hand to mouth. Smoking waterpipes, also known as shisha or hookah, often involves the sharing of mouth pieces and hoses, which could facilitate the transmission of the COVID-19 virus in communal and social settings. <SEP> As a smoker, is my risk of getting the COVID-19 virus higher than that of a non-smoker? <EOS>
 Yes. Given the overlap in signs and symptoms between SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viral infections, including influenza, FDA has authorized multi-analyte respiratory panels for the qualitative detection and differentiation of nucleic acid from multiple pathogens, including the SARS-CoV-2 virus. These panels are useful when multiple respiratory pathogens are circulating at the same time, as is expected with the upcoming flu season. The ability to run one test to identify which pathogen is present provides faster results overall and more efficient use of resources.
When determining whether to issue an EUA for a multi-analyte respiratory panel, FDA considers, among other things, the use of the test (multi-analyte pathogen detection as an aid in differential diagnosis), clearance/approval status of IVDs for the other panel members, whether the proposed Intended Use fits within the HHS emergency declaration and how the panel test would fit into current recommendations of public health authorities regarding patient testing.
If you would like to develop and offer a multi-analyte respiratory panel that includes SARS-CoV-2, please see the Molecular Diagnostic Template for Commercial Manufacturers or Molecular Diagnostic Template for Laboratories for recommendations on how to validate the test for this use and for recommendations on what to include in your EUA request to the FDA.
Please note that the policies in the Policy for Coronavirus Disease-2019 Tests do not apply to multi-analyte respiratory panels, and the FDA expects developers of such tests to request and receive an EUA prior to offering or marketing their test. <SEP>  Can I request an EUA for my multi-analyte respiratory panel that includes SARS-CoV-2?

If you have any doubts about the legitimacy of your conversation with a contact tracer, you may hang up and call your local health department. You should also feel free to request the name and ID of anyone who calls.
You can find your local health department's contact information through the Department of Health's directory.
What A Contact Tracer Will NOT Ask

A contact tracer will never ask for your social security number
A contact tracer will never ask for confidential financial information like your bank or credit card number.
A contact tracer will never ask about your immigration status and ICE will not be notified about your location.
The information you share will not be used for the purposes of law enforcement or immigration enforcement in any way.
The information you share will not negatively affect your public charge assessment or be used to deny access to health care or any other essential service.
Your cell phone is never tracked, a GPS location is not followed, and geolocation data is not collected or used.

If someone is requesting personal information covered above, it is likely a scam. You can report these calls online to the New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs or by calling 973-504-6240.
To learn more about scams and distinguish between facts and rumors/disinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic visit the New Jersey Office Homeland Security and Preparedness' Rumor Control and Disinformation page.
What A Contact Tracer WILL Ask
To ensure you have the care you need and the support to keep you and your family safe, you may be asked:

To confirm your date of birth, address, or other basic information.
Discuss any symptoms you may have had, whether you were hospitalized, or any underlying health conditions that might put you at greater risk.
Details about your living situation so you can be informed on how to safely self-isolate or self-quarantine.
If you are uninsured, so we can give you additional information about free testing and care.
You may also be asked about your job to determine if you are a health care worker or essential worker and therefore must comply with additional safety requirements.

If you tested positive for COVID-19:

A contact tracer will work with you to identify your close contacts - anyone who was within six feet of you for more than 10 minutes starting two days before you first had symptoms.
If you don't have symptoms, we'll ask about your activity during the two days before your diagnosis.
We will also ask for the phone numbers of anyone you tell us about, so they can be called and cared for.

Your information is confidential. Your name will not be released to your contacts or your COVID-19 status – that information will only be known to public health officials and our local health departments.
We will encourage you to let your contacts know about your illness, and we will call your contacts to let them know they have been exposed and what steps they should take to protect themselves and their loved ones. But again, we will not tell them your name. If you are staying at home during the isolation period, the contact tracer will discuss any needs you may have and connect you with additional support should you need it.

The Federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), signed into law on March 27, contains provisions that support individuals and small businesses in a number of ways.
Increased Unemployment Insurance Payments, Duration, and Eligibility
Those already receiving unemployment insurance benefits began receiving an additional $600 per week, which began arriving in mid April. It is issued separately from regular unemployment benefits.
Under the new Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) program, individuals typically not eligible for unemployment compensation, such as independent contractors, self-employed workers, or those with limited employment history, will be able to receive unemployment benefits.
In total, eligible claimants can now receive up to 59 weeks of unemployment benefits. New Jersey is providing 20 weeks of extended unemployment to New Jersey workers who have exhausted their state and federal jobless benefits. The state extension kicks in after claimants exhaust 26 weeks of state unemployment plus 13 weeks of federal Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation.
Workers in this group, who have applied for regular unemployment and been denied, do not have to do anything further. The Department began reaching out April 29, 2020, and has started processing payments.
Claimants must certify for these benefits online each week. The certification schedule -- based on Social Security number -- can be found at myunemployment.nj.gov.
Additionally, workers who left their job to provide coronavirus-related care to themselves, their family, or other relatives, will be eligible for unemployment benefits.
Unemployment Compensation breakdown:

$600 in additional unemployment benefits for individuals currently qualifying under Unemployment Insurance
A federal match of state Unemployment Insurance + $600 for unemployed workers who are typically ineligible
A 13-week extension of unemployment compensation beyond the default state duration

For more information and to learn how to apply for PUA, see the NJDOL's April 29, 2020 press release.
Direct Payments to Individuals and Households
Economic impact payments have been distributed automatically, with no action required for most people.
Eligible taxpayers who filed tax returns for either 2019 or 2018 automatically received an economic impact payment of up to $1,200 for individuals or $2,400 for married couples. Parents also receive $500 for each qualifying child.
Some seniors and others who do not file returns will need to submit a simple tax return to receive the stimulus payment.
You can check your eligibility, figure out if you need to take any steps to get your payment, and check the status of your payment on the IRS's Economic Impact Payment webpage.
Retirement Accounts
The usual 10% penalty on early distributions of IRA and defined contributions plans (like 401(k) plans) has been waived for coronavirus-eligible distributions up to $100,000.
Small Business Support
Emergency grants: Under the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program, eligible businesses may pursue grants of up to $10,000 to cover immediate operating costs.
Forgivable loans: Businesses with less than 500 employees may be eligible for loans up to $10 million. Costs associated with payroll, mortgage interest, utilities, and rent are forgivable.
Tax Credits: Employers who have partly or entirely shut down may be eligible for a tax credit of a percentage of wages paid to employees during the coronavirus public health emergency.
Manufacturing Extension Program: Eligible small and medium sized manufacturers may receive funding to support cost reduction, workforce development, product development, and growth initiatives.
Federal Student Loan Forbearance
The CARES Act provides temporary relief to particular student loan borrowers. To determine if your loans are eligible, contact your loan servicer online or by phone. Your servicer is the entity to which you make your monthly payment. If you do not know who your servicer is or how to contact them, visit StudentAid.gov/login or call 1-800-4-FED-AID (1-800-433-3243; TTY for the deaf or hearing-impaired 1-800-730-8913) for assistance.

Inpatient Behavioral:

Residential treatment facilities must have an infection control program to prevent spread of disease among residents, visitors, and staff. The residential treatment facility should use these control practices along with their written infection control program that may allow short-term changes to their visitation policy.

Acute Care Hospitals:

Hospitals must have an infection control program to prevent spread of disease among residents, visitors, and staff. The hospital should use these control practices along with their written infection control program that may allow short-term changes to their visitation policy.

General guidance includes:

Educate and screen visitors. Educate all family members and other visitors about COVID-19 and the risks. Make sure visitors follow any rules you have for your facility. Screen visitors who are may be sick, have traveled recently to an area with COVID-19 spreading, or who have been in close contact with a person who has COVID-19 or is sick with a cold or flu-like illness. Please see our Example Visitor Announcement (PDF) that you can use to fit your location.
If visitors have breathing problems while at the facility, they should be removed from others and sent home right away. Make sure your employees, visitors, and clients are aware of these rules.
Visitors with signs of illness should stay out and not return until they are free of fever (oral thermometer temperature of 100.4 degrees F/37.8 degrees C or greater), signs of a fever, and any other symptoms for at least 24 hours, without use of fever-reducing or other medicines (such as cough medicine).
Post signs at doors that tell clients, staff, volunteers, visitors, and others not to enter if they have signs of illness (such as fever or cough). Post materials in the languages used by the community you serve.
Post signs all over the facility about proper hand washing, covering coughs and sneezes, and not touching their face with unwashed hands. Post materials in the languages used by the community you serve.
Place alcohol-based hand gel at all doorways and key locations as possible. Also, use signs telling people where the nearest sink is to wash hands with soap and water. <SEP> What guidance is there for hospital or residential treatment facility visitation policies? <EOS>
COVID-19 does appear to affect brain function in some people. Specific neurological symptoms seen in people with COVID-19 include loss of smell, inability to taste, muscle weakness, tingling or numbness in the hands and feet, dizziness, confusion, delirium, seizures, and stroke.One study that looked at 214 people with moderate to severe COVID-19 in Wuhan, China found that about one-third of those patients had one or more neurological symptoms. Neurological symptoms were more common in people with more severe disease.Neurological symptoms have also been seen in COVID-19 patients in the US and around the world. Some people with neurological symptoms tested positive for COVID-19 but did not have any respiratory symptoms like coughing or difficulty breathing; others experienced both neurological and respiratory symptoms.Experts do not know how the coronavirus causes neurological symptoms. They may be a direct result of infection or an indirect consequence of inflammation or altered oxygen and carbon dioxide levels caused by the virus.The CDC has added "new confusion or inability to rouse" to its list of emergency warning signs that should prompt you to get immediate medical attention. <SEP> Can COVID-19 affect brain function? <EOS>

If you are at higher risk for serious illness from COVID-19 because of your age or because you have a serious long-term health problem, it is extra important for you to take actions to reduce your risk of getting sick with the disease. Limit your interaction with other people as much as possible. Take precautions to prevent getting COVID-19 when you do interact with others. Visit https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html.
You should:

Have drugs and supplies on hand

Call your military or civilian health care team to ask if you need extra prescription drugs in case there is a COVID-19 outbreak in your area and you need to stay home for longer than your prescriptions will last.
 for more information.) You may be able to have an authorized person pick up your drugs from the military or retail pharmacy or get them delivered to your home – call your pharmacy for information. If you are sick and should stay home, think about using the TRICARE mail-order pharmacy program. (Certain rules may apply that you’ll need to follow.  See tricare.mil/pharmacy
Be sure you have over-the-counter medicines and supplies (tissues, fever-reducing drugs, etc.) on hand to treat fever and other symptoms.
Have enough household items and groceries on hand so that you can stay at home for a long period of time – as determined your care provider and local guidance


Take everyday safety measures:
    
Avoid contact with people who are sick.  Stay home as much as possible
Wash your hands often - with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds.  Wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing, or being in a public place.
If soap and water aren’t available, use a hand sanitizer that is at least 60% alcohol.
Avoid crowds, especially in poorly ventilated spaces.  Don’t shake hands or hug others.   Your risk of exposure to respiratory viruses like COVID-19 is higher in crowded, closed-in settings with little air flow if there are people in the crowd who are sick.  Use extra caution if you have to go out in public. 
        
Limit your touching of frequently touched surfaces: elevator buttons, door handles, hand rails.
Use a tissue or your sleeve to cover your hand or finger if you must touch something.
Wash or sanitize your hands after touching often-touched public surfaces


Avoid touching your face, nose, and eyes, much as possible.
Clean and disinfect your home to remove germs: clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces (for example: tables, doorknobs, light switches, handles, desks, toilets, faucets, sinks & cell phones).
If COVID-19 is spreading in your community, take extra steps to distance yourself from other people.  Think about ways of getting food to your home, for example, have family, or social and commercial services drop them off. <SEP> What should I do if I’m at higher risk for getting sick from COVD-19? <EOS>

If you were to share saliva with someone — kiss, drink from the same cup — you could obviously get the disease. But it’s not just direct contact that can cause transmission. After pressure from researchers, the W.H.O. conceded that the virus can be transmitted through particles that can linger in the air for hours after an infected person has left. 
The nastiest recent revelation is, perhaps, that flushing a toilet can also spread the virus throughout a bathroom.
There is some good news, though. After months of sanitizing our groceries, packages and mail, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that the risk of catching the coronavirus from a surface is low. <SEP> I keep hearing about droplets, aerosol clouds and surface contamination.

Except in instances in which viral testing is delayed, antibody tests should not be used to    diagnose a current COVID-19 infection. An antibody test may not show if you have a current COVID-19 infection because it can take 1–3 weeks after infection for your body to make antibodies.
A positive test result shows you may have antibodies from an infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. However, there is a chance a positive result means that you have antibodies from an infection with a virus from the same family of viruses (called coronaviruses), such as the one that causes the common cold.  Having antibodies to the virus that causes COVID-19 may provide protection from getting infected with the virus again. If it does, we do not know how much protection the antibodies may provide or how long this protection may last. Talk with your healthcare provider about your test result and the type of test you took to understand what your result means. Your provider may suggest you take a second type of antibody test to see if the first test was accurate. You should continue to protect yourself and others since you could get infected with the virus again. If you work in a job where you wear personal protective equipment (PPE), continue wearing PPE. You may test positive for antibodies even if you have never had symptoms of COVID-19. This can happen if you had an infection without symptoms, which is called an asymptomatic infection.
If you test negative for antibodies (blood test), that means you may not have ever had COVID-19. Talk with your healthcare provider about your test result and the type of test you took to understand what your result means. You could still have a current infection.  The test may be negative because it typically takes 1–3 weeks after infection for your body to make antibodies. It’s possible you could still get sick if you have been exposed to the virus recently. This means you could still spread the virus. Some people may take even longer to develop antibodies, and some people who are infected may not ever develop antibodies.
If you get symptoms after the antibody test, you might need another test called a viral test​.
Regardless of whether you test positive or negative, the results do not confirm whether or not you are able to spread the virus that causes COVID-19. Until we know more, continue to take steps to protect yourself and others.

Yes. The MDOC began with a system of symptomatic testing, where a prisoner with just one symptom met the criteria for a test and would be tested. The department also started a system of mass testing that began at Lakeland and G. Robert Cotton Correctional Facilities in April and then partnered with the Michigan National Guard to conduct department-wide testing for COVID-19 at all facilities in the state. Now that the department-wide testing is complete, ongoing testing continues for both prisoners and employees. Prisoners are tested whenever they are transferred, paroled, scheduled to go off-site for appointments, or housed in a location where the department sees an increase in positive cases. Facility wide testing is done at these locations and free testing is offered to employees. <SEP> Are prisoners being tested for Covid-19? <EOS>

If a child becomes ill with COVID-19 like symptoms (cough, fever, fatigue, etc.) the parents should contact their physician and the child should stay at home until the symptoms disappear. Once the child is asymptomatic, follow the physician’s advice regarding reintroduction into the school setting.
Children should quarantine and not attend school if they live in a household where someone has been confirmed to have COVID-19.
If the household case is isolated or managed in hospital, quarantine for the child should be for 14 days since the child’s last exposure to the case.
If the case is managed at home and not isolated, the 14-day quarantine for the child should be counted from the day when all three of the following criteria are met for the case: eight days after the onset of symptoms AND resolution of fever AND clinical improvement of other symptoms for at least for three days. <SEP> 6.

In most cases, you do not need to shut down your facility. But do close off any areas used for prolonged periods of time by the sick person:

Wait 24 hours before cleaning and disinfecting to minimize potential for other employees being exposed to respiratory droplets. If waiting 24 hours is not feasible, wait as long as possible.

Follow the CDC cleaning and disinfection recommendations:

Clean dirty surfaces with soap and water before disinfecting them.
To disinfect surfaces, use products that meet EPA criteria for use against SARS-Cov-2external icon, the virus that causes COVID-19, and are appropriate for the surface.
Be sure to follow the instructions on the product labels to ensure safe and effective use of the product.
You may need to wear additional personal protective equipment (PPE) depending on the setting and disinfectant product you are using.

In addition to cleaning and disinfecting, employers should determine which employees may have been exposed to the virus and need to take additional precautions:

If an employee is confirmed to have COVID-19, employers should inform fellow employees of their possible exposure to COVID-19 in the workplace but maintain confidentiality as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).
Employees who test positive for COVID-19 (using a viral test, not an antibody test) should be excluded from work and remain in home isolation if they do not need to be hospitalized. Employers should provide education to employees on what to do if they are sick.
Employers may need to work with local health department officials to determine which employees may have had close contact with the employee with COVID-19 and who may need to take additional precautions, including exclusion from work and remaining at home.
Most workplaces should follow the Public Health Recommendations for Community-Related Exposure and instruct potentially exposed employees to stay home for 14 days, telework if possible, and self-monitor for symptoms.
Critical infrastructure workplaces should follow the guidance Implementing Safety Practices for Critical Infrastructure Employees Who May Have Had Exposure to a Person with Suspected or Confirmed COVID-19.

Sick employees should follow CDC-recommended steps. Employees should not return to work until they have met the criteria to discontinue home isolation and have consulted with a healthcare provider. Antibody test results should not be used to make decisions about returning persons to the workplace. <SEP> What should I do if an employee is suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19? <EOS>

CDC recommends that law enforcement personnel practice everyday measures to protect their household members from becoming ill. These measures include:

hand hygiene
covering coughs and sneezes
disinfecting frequently touched surfaces daily

Many law enforcement personnel routinely change out of their uniforms at the station and wear street clothes and shoes home. Laundry services for uniforms may be provided by law enforcement agencies. Continuing this practice may help minimize the potential of transmitting the virus that causes COVID-19 and other potential take-home exposures. Law enforcement personnel should perform hand hygiene after changing out of uniforms.
They also should have a plan for household members who are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. <SEP> Should law enforcement personnel and other first responders take additional precautions when coming home, even if they have no symptoms of COVID-19, to avoid potentially exposing household members? <EOS>

Yes. On March 26, 2020, the FDIC, FRB, OCC, CFPB, and NCUA issued a joint statement encouraging financial institutions to offer responsible small-dollar loans to consumers and small businesses in response to COVID-19. The statement recognizes that such loans can play an important role in meeting customers' credit needs because of temporary cash-flow imbalances, unexpected expenses, or income disruptions during periods of economic stress or disaster recoveries. Loans can be offered through a variety of structures including open-end lines of credit, closed-end installment loans, or appropriately structured single payment loans, and should be offered in a manner that provides fair treatment of consumers, complies with applicable laws and regulations, and is consistent with safe and sound practices.

Workplaces for jobs at medium risk require daily cleaning and disinfection at least two times a day of objects and surfaces that are touched regularly, including all shared rooms, surfaces, floors, bathrooms, and changing rooms. Consider suspending any activity where physical distancing of at least 1 metre cannot be implemented in full. If this is not possible, increase ventilation, implement enhanced regular hand hygiene, and require staff to wear appropriate face masks, goggles, gloves and work clothes during cleaning procedures that generate splashes, providing training on their use. Organize changing and washing of work clothes at the workplace, so that workers to do take them home. <SEP> What additional measures should be taken at workplaces and for jobs at medium risk? <EOS>
The CDC has stated that if no manufactured masks are available, that homemade masks such as bandanas or scarves may be used as a last resort. Although, there have not been studies done to see whether these are effective.
More recently, as hospitals and healthcare workers experience shortages of personal protective equipment, calls are going out for community volunteers to sew face fabric, reusable masks. There are several websites with patterns and directions, and studies have been conducted comparing DIY mask materials with vacuum cleaner bags, pillowcase fabric, and 100% cotton t-shirt material most protective, though not as protective as a commercial N95 mask.

​Federal guidelines for PUA define "self-employed individuals" as those whose primary reliance for income is on the performance of services in the individual's own business or on the individual's own farm.For the purposes of PUA, "self-employed" includes independent contractors, gig economy workers, and workers for certain religious entities. In Pennsylvania, the determination of whether you are an "employee" or an "independent contractor" depends on the conditions of your work, not on what your employer tells you or how your employer has classified you. To be considered an independent contractor, both of the following must be shown to the satisfaction of the department:The individual has been and will continue to be free from control or direction over the performance of the services involved, both under the contract of service and in fact, andAs to such services, the individual is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, profession or business.If an individual performs services in the construction industry, the Construction Workplace Misclassification Act (Act 72), imposes additional criteria that must be met for the individual to be recognized as an independent contractor. Under Act 72, all of the following requirements must be satisfied:The individual has a written contract to perform the services,The individual is free from control or direction over the performance of the services involved both under the contract of service and in fact, andAs to such services, the individual is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, profession or business. <SEP> ​How do I determine if I am "self-employed"? <EOS>
PCR tests and antigen tests are both diagnostic tests, which means that they can be used to determine whether you currently have an active coronavirus infection. However, there are important differences between these two types of tests.PCR tests detect the presence of the virus's genetic material using a technique called reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, or RT-PCR. For this test, a sample may be collected through a nasal or throat swab, or a saliva sample may be used. The sample is typically sent to a laboratory where coronavirus RNA (if present) is extracted from the sample and converted into DNA. The DNA is then amplified, meaning that many of copies of the viral DNA are made, in order to produce a measurable result. The accuracy of any diagnostic test depends on many factors, including whether the sample was collected properly, when during the course of illness the testing was done, and whether the sample was maintained in appropriate conditions while it was shipped to the laboratory. Generally speaking, PCR tests are highly accurate. However, it can take days to over a week to get the results of a PCR test.Antigen tests detect specific proteins on the surface of the coronavirus. They are sometimes referred to as rapid diagnostic tests because it can take less than an hour to get the test results. Positive antigen test results are highly specific, meaning that if you test positive you are very likely to be infected. However, there is a higher chance of false negatives with antigen tests, which means that a negative result cannot definitively rule out an active infection. If you have a negative result on an antigen test, your doctor may order a PCR test to confirm the result.It may be helpful to think of a COVID antigen test as you would think of a rapid strep test or a rapid flu test. A positive result for any of these tests is likely to be accurate, and allows diagnosis and treatment to begin quickly, while a negative result often results in further testing to confirm or overturn the initial result. <SEP> What is the difference between a PCR test and an antigen test for COVID-19? <EOS>

There is some anecdotal evidence that there may be some benefit to using chloroquine at different stages of infection, and a little bit of lab data suggesting it might have some effects on the virus, but there isn't good data that it works at a particular point in the infection or even that it works at all. There are ongoing studies the results of which are coming; we should get some results soon telling us not just whether it works, but also when it works, at what dose, and other actionable information. (Dr. Josh Sharfstein, 4/6/20) <SEP> Is there evidence for using chloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19? <EOS>
At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.  A small number of pets have been reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after contact with people with COVID-19.
Pets have other types of coronaviruses that can make them sick, like canine and feline coronaviruses. These other coronaviruses cannot infect people and are not related to the current COVID-19 outbreak.
Since animals can spread other diseases to people, it’s always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, such as washing your hands and maintaining good hygiene. For more information on the many benefits of pet ownership, as well as staying safe and healthy around animals including pets, livestock, and wildlife, visit CDC’s Healthy Pets, Healthy People website. <SEP> Can I get COVID-19 from my pets or other animals? <EOS>

If you are a possible contact, you should first be contacted by phone or in person by health authorities to determine if you meet the contact definition, which is anyone who has had direct contact or was within 1 metre for at least 15 minutes with a person infected with COVID-19. If you are confirmed as a contact, you will then be encouraged and supported to be in quarantine, which means to separate yourself from others, and to monitor your health for any signs of illness. The monitoring ends 14 days you were last into contact with the person infected with COVID-19.By participating in contact tracing, you are contributing to controlling spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 in your area; vulnerable people will be protected, and more restrictive measures, such as general stay-at-home orders, might be avoided or minimized. This is an act of solidarity for your community. <SEP> What happens if you are a contact? <EOS>
The most common signs of COVID-19 are a fever,
               cough, and trouble breathing. Some people might have:

symptoms of a cold such as a sore
               throat, congestion, or a runny nose
chills
muscle pain
headache
a loss of taste or smell
nausea or vomiting
diarrhea
tiredness

Some kids are having symptoms caused by inflammation
               throughout the body, sometimes several weeks after they were infected with the virus.
               This is called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in
               children (MIS-C). Doctors are trying to find out how these symptoms are related
               to coronavirus infection.
Symptoms of MIS-C can include:

fever 
belly pain
vomiting or diarrhea
neck pain
a rash
red eyes
feeling very tired
red, cracked lips
swollen hands or feet
swollen lymph nodes

Most kids with MIS-C get better after they get special care in the hospital, sometimes
               in the ICU (intensive care unit). <SEP> What Are the Signs & Symptoms of Coronavirus (COVID-19)? <EOS>
No foods will prevent viral infections. Keep your immune system healthy by eating foods rich in vitamin C. For general health, eat a varied diet with plenty of fresh vegetables and fruits.

Some cases of coronavirus do lead to pneumonia. But the pneumonia vaccine won’t help.
“Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, only help protect people from these specific bacterial infections,” according to Harvard Medical School.
“They do not protect against any coronavirus pneumonia.”
The flu shot does not protect against coronavirus. But it does help protect against a massive, unnecessary burden on hospitals already overwhelmed with coronavirus.

People with no symptoms should be able to stay at home, if adequately isolated from others, but this should be confirmed by a doctor. Those with mild or moderate disease can be considered for home care if they are under the age of 60, do not smoke, are not obese, and do not have other diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease, cancer, chronic kidney disease, immunosuppression. A health worker will assess risk factors along with the person’s symptoms, medical history and ability for the family to manage the care. Household members need to limit shared spaces, practice the recommended hygiene and know how to recognize and respond to signs of worsening health.A trained health worker will need to assess whether the home in question is suitable for the isolation and care of a COVID-19 patient, and proper infection prevention control measures are put in place.

Help educate those around you about the fact that, although it seemed at first that COVID-19 began in China, the disease itself doesn't target specific races of people, nor are particular races more likely to get it than others. In fact, countries across the world, including most of Europe and the United States, have confirmed cases of COVID-19, and it is now more prevalent in the United States than in China. It affects people of diverse populations, and anyone can catch it. 

Chinese and Asian people who you meet are no more likely to be infected than someone of any other race, unless they recently returned from China or were around someone who is sick.

Strokes occur when the brain's blood supply is interrupted, usually by a blood clot. Recently, there have been reports of a greater-than-expected number of younger patients being hospitalized for, and sometimes dying from, serious strokes. These strokes are happening in patients who test positive for coronavirus but who do not have any traditional risk factors for stroke. They tend to have no COVID-19 symptoms, or only mild symptoms. The type of stroke occurring in these patients typically occurs in much older patients.COVID-related strokes occur because of a bodywide increase in blood clot formation, which can damage any organ, not just the brain. A blood clot in the lungs is called pulmonary embolism and can cause shortness of breath, chest pain, or death; a blood clot in or near the heart can cause a heart attack; and blood clots in the kidneys can cause kidney damage requiring dialysis.We don't yet know if the coronavirus itself stimulates blood clots to form, or if they are a result of an overactive immune response to the virus. <SEP> Does COVID-19 cause strokes?

 During the COVID-19 public health emergency, the FDA does not expect manufacturers to submit notification to FDA before they begin marketing their product or to comply with certain regulatory requirements where the medical gloves do not create an undue risk in light of the pandemic as outlined in the FDA’s policy for gloves that is in effect during the COVID-19 public health emergency.
Under the policy, the FDA believes patient examination gloves do not create such an undue risk where:
The gloves include labeling that:
	Accurately describes the product as an “unpowdered glove” (as opposed to a “surgeon’s glove”);
Accurately describes of the product’s sterility status (i.e., non-sterile);
Does not claim that the product is latex-free or otherwise free of a specific material;
Includes a list of the body contacting materials; and
Includes recommendations and general statements that would reduce the risk of use. For example:
		A statement that the gloves have not been cleared by FDA.
A recommendation against using when FDA-cleared gloves are available.
A recommendation against using in surgical settings.


The product is not intended for any use that would create an undue risk. For example, the labeling does not include uses with chemotherapy drugs, fentanyl, and other opioids, for allergy or dermatitis prevention, for antimicrobial or antiviral protection, or for infection prevention or reduction.
Under the policy, the FDA believes that surgeon’s gloves do not create such an undue risk where:
The gloves meet the standard described in ASTM D3577External Link Disclaimer and have been manufactured in compliance with good manufacturing practices.
The gloves include labeling that:
	Accurately describes product as being unpowdered;
Accurately describes the product’s sterility status (i.e., sterile) and the sterilization method used;
Does not claim that the product is latex-free or otherwise free of a specific material;
Includes a list of the body contacting materials; and

Older children can be a little cranky about adapting to life with masks, but younger children are perfectly positioned to learn a new drill.
Most children enjoy the chance to feel morally superior to adults (and adults often make this all too easy); go ahead and encourage a little righteousness. They can be the family monitors, reminding their parents not to forget their face coverings when they leave the house.
For some children, though, even the humblest of masks can be scary — scary in themselves, and scary as reminders of the threat of infection and the generally frightening moment. By making it into a game, or buying see-through or emotive masks for the family, you can alleviate their anxiety.

COVID-19 (coronavirus) is an illness caused by a virus that can spread from person to person. The virus that causes COVID–19 is a new coronavirus that has spread throughout the world. COVID-19 symptoms can range from mild (or no symptoms) to severe. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html <SEP> What is COVID-19? <EOS>
There is currently no evidence that people can catch COVID-19 from food, including fruits and vegetables. Fresh fruits and vegetables are part of a healthy diet and their consumption should be encouraged.  Read more in the COVID-19 and food safety: guidance for food businesses. <SEP> Can I get COVID-19 from eating fresh foods, like fruits and vegetables? <EOS>
Yes. Consult with local health officials if you determine your team or coaches have been exposed to COVID-19. Individuals who recently had close contact with a person with COVID-19 should follow CDC’s guidance for when you can be around others.

The CDC is regularly updating guidance on who physicians should test for COVID-19.
Currently, there are five considerations for when viral tests, which are used to diagnose acute infection, are appropriate, though final decisions about testing are made by state and local health departments or health care providers based on local situations. These considerations include:
When individuals present signs or symptoms consistent with COVID-19
To control transmission when an asymptomatic individual is suspected to have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2
For early identification of asymptomatic individuals without known or suspected exposure in special settings
To determine the resolution of an infection
In public health surveillance efforts for SARS-CoV-2

Clinicians should consult with their local or state health department or the labs that perform their diagnostic services. <SEP> 1. When should I test patients for COVID-19 with viral tests (nucleoid acid or antigen tests)? <EOS>
The IACUC may expedite  the three-year complete review and approval using the procedures of IV.C.2, Designated Member Review (DMR). An example of how to expedite the continuing three-year review of the currently approved protocol using DMR includes the following steps:

Due to the pandemic or other disaster, the IACUC establishes a shortened response time for calling for full-committee review (FCR) that is agreed to by the members, for example two business days.
The IACUC also agrees to a policy with a standard period to renew the protocols due to expire, for example 6 months or one year.
All IACUC members receive a list of proposed research protocols due to expire and access to the necessary information on the protocols to be reviewed.
If any member asks for certain protocols to go before the full committee, then the indicated protocols must be deferred for FCR. Any member may ask to send the protocol to FCR at any time during the agreed time period.
If no member calls for FCR, the Chair refers the protocols to a designated reviewer. The Chair may select one or more members, qualified to review the protocols, who act on behalf of the entire IACUC to either approve the protocols, request additional information from the PI to approve them, or refer for FCR.
Once approved, the protocol’s renewal period is based on the IACUC’s policy, for example 6 months or one year.
Only the procedures described in the protocol that is approved by the designated member may be performed unless a subsequent amendment is submitted, reviewed, and approved.

The designated-reviewer approval has equal validity to FCR approval and does not require subsequent reapproval or notification by a convened meeting. The IACUC always has the option to discuss protocols approved by either method in future meetings as a form of continuing review or in response to animal welfare concerns. <SEP> 18. During the pandemic, how may the IACUC expedite the three-year complete review of a currently approved protocol that is due to expire and still meet the PHS Policy requirements?

Someone who is in quarantine or isolation should stay home and away from other
               people to avoid spreading the virus. They should:

Keep at least 6 feet away from other household members and pets when possible.
Wear a mask (or face covering) if they
               must be around other people and can't stay 6 feet apart. Children under 2 years old
               and people who have trouble breathing should not wear a mask. To see how to put on
               and remove masks, clean them, or make your own cloth face covering, check the CDC's
               guide.
Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue, throw the tissue away, and then wash their
               hands right away. Wash with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use alcohol-based
               hand sanitizer.
Wash their hands well and often. Wash
               with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
Every day, use a household cleaner or wipe to clean things that get touched a
               lot. These include doorknobs, light switches, toys, remote controls, sink handles,
               counters, and phones.

Someone in isolation who has symptoms of COVID-19 or had a positive test
               also should:

Sleep in a bedroom not used by anyone else. If that's not possible, try to keep
               as much of a distance as possible between beds. If sharing a bed, even sleeping head
               to toe can help.
Use a separate bathroom, if possible.

“One of the most important things to keep in mind is that children use adults to understand the world,” Dr. Rogers says. “So kids will be more or less anxious based on how the adults around them are communicating with them.”
Kids and teenagers alike need adults to help them put this situation in perspective.
“They also don’t have a lot of life experience to put something like COVID-19 in context,” says Dr. Rogers. “They really do need adults to interpret information for them.”
Dr. Rogers also reminds adults that children are often more tuned-in to what is happening than adults realize.
“Be aware that children often listen to adult conversations even when they don’t seem to be,” she says. “It’s best to talk with them directly and also to reassure them as much as possible.” <SEP> Kids pay close attention to how adults talk about the coronavirus <EOS>

Anyone except people who are sick. If you feel sick with COVID-19-like symptoms (fever, cough, shortness of breath,
    chills, night sweats, sore throat, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, tiredness, muscle or body aches, headaches,
    confusion, or loss of sense of taste/smell), you are required to stay home and not go to any gatherings to
        avoid getting other people sick. Additionally, people at higher risk of severe illness or death from
    COVID-19 (due to age or medical condition) are strongly encouraged to stay home and not attend gatherings. <SEP> Who is allowed to attend a gathering? <EOS>
There are over 30 treatments currently being tested around the world. Interferon Alfa 2B has historically been used to treat diseases such as dengue fever, HIV, and Hepatitis. However, no treatments have been demonstrated to be safe and effective in high quality studies. This treatment, like others, is considered experimental for COVID-19 at this time. (Dr. Josh Sharfstein, 4/8/20) <SEP> Is Interferon Alfa 2B an effective treatment? Should we be encouraging our medical community to obtain this for use in our community? <EOS>
Another setting that presents a risk for COVID-19 spreading is events and gatherings. That’s why every gathering
    allowed under the Order needs to have a designated host who is responsible for keeping contact information for all
    the attendees. If someone who attended the gathering ends up testing positive for COVID-19, the host is legally
    required to assist Public Health with efforts to trace and contact other people who may have been exposed at the
    gathering by providing their contact information. Because indoor gatherings are particularly risky, the Health
    Officer has prohibited them from occurring at this time. <SEP> What is Public Health doing about COVID-19 cases at events and gatherings? <EOS>
As of May 14, around 6.8% of reported COVID-19 cases (globally) had died. The current mortality for known cases of COVID-19 is about 2.4% in South Korea and 4.5% in Germany, countries where there has been widespread testing.
Because many mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 infections go unreported, it is thought the case fatality ratio is lower than 2%, possibly about 1%; but that would still mean that COVID-19 is at least ten times more deadly than the flu, and very dangerous.

DON’T wear a mask with a valve. 
N95 respirators sold in hardware stores—as well as some designer masks—come with a little plastic valve in the front. The problem is that this valve only filters the air you breathe in. The air you breathe out is not blocked at all. 
“When you wear a mask with a valve, people around you are not protected because the valve lets all of your breath into the air,” Glucoft says. “From that perspective, it’s almost like you’re not wearing a mask at all.” 
Valve masks are not allowed at CHLA. If you come to CHLA with a valve mask, you will be given a different mask to wear.  
DON’T buy medical masks or respirators. 
Surgical masks and medical N95 respirators (which do not have valves) are in short supply. If you already have these masks, you can wear them. But please do not buy more. It’s critical to save them for health care workers, who need them to safely care for high-risk patients.  
DO wear: 
Cloth mask. This is an excellent option. A cloth mask is typically made with elastic loops that fit over your ears—making it easy to take on and off. It should have multiple layers of fabric. You can either buy cloth masks or make your own.  
Bandana, T-shirt or scarf. This type of mask is OK, although it may not fit your face as well as a cloth mask.  
Neck gaiter. Also called a buff, a neck gaiter is a tube of stretchy fabric often used to keep your face and neck warm in cold weather. But it can also be a good face mask—although it may not be ideal for hot weather. <SEP> Choosing a mask: Do’s and Don’ts <EOS>

The response to COVID-19 can benefit from the capacity building efforts developed for tuberculosis (TB) over many years of investment by national authorities and donors. These include infection prevention and control, contact tracing, household and community-based care, and surveillance and monitoring systems.Although modes of transmission of the two diseases are slightly different, administrative, environmental and personal protection measures apply to both (e.g. basic infection prevention and control, cough etiquette, patient triage). TB laboratory networks have been established in countries with the support of WHO and international partners. These networks as well as specimen transportation mechanisms could also be used for COVID-19 diagnosis and surveillance.Respiratory physicians, pulmonology staff of all grades, TB specialists and health workers at the primary health care level may be points of reference for patients with pulmonary complications of COVID-19. They should familiarize themselves with the most current WHO recommendations for the supportive treatment and containment of COVID-19. TB programme staff with their experience and capacity, including in active case finding and contact tracing, are well placed to support the COVID-19 response.Various digital technologies used in TB programmes can      support the COVID-19 response, including adherence support, electronic      medical records and eLearning. <SEP> What services can be leveraged across both diseases? <EOS>
It appears unlikely, but the CDC advises taking precautions.
Experts believe coronavirus is mainly spread during close contact (about 6 feet) with a person who is currently infected, the CDC said.
“This type of spread is not a concern after death,” the CDC said. But it cautions that “we are still learning how it spreads.”
“There may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing,” the CDC said. 
“Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible.”
If washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, “families are encouraged to work with their community’s cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible,” the CDC said.
“At a minimum, people conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves. If splashing of fluids is expected, additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be required (such as disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N-95 respirator).”
Cremated remains can be considered sterile, as infectious agents do not survive incineration-range temperatures, the CDC said. <SEP> Can you get coronavirus by touching a dead body or the ashes of someone who had Covid-19? <EOS>
While both tuberculosis (TB) and COVID-19 spread by close contact between people the exact mode of transmission differs, explaining some differences in infection control measures to mitigate the two conditions.  TB bacilli remain suspended in the air in droplet nuclei for several hours after a TB patient coughs, sneezes, shouts, or sings, and people who inhale them can get infected. The size of these droplet nuclei is a key factor determining their infectiousness. Their concentration decreases with ventilation and exposure to direct sunlight.  COVID-19 transmission has primarily been attributed to the direct breathing of droplets expelled by someone with COVID-19 (people may be infectious before clinical features become apparent). Droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, exhaling and speaking may land on objects and surfaces, and contacts can get infected with COVID-19 by touching them and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth . Handwashing, in addition to respiratory precautions, are thus important in the control of COVID-19. <SEP> Do COVID-19 and tuberculosis spread in the same way? <EOS>

If you have been in close contact with someone with COVID-19, you may be infected.Close contact means that you live with or have been in settings of less than 1 metre from those who have the disease. In these cases, it is best to stay at home. 
However, if you live in an area with malaria or dengue fever it is important that you do not ignore symptoms of fever.  Seek medical help.  When you attend the health facility wear a mask if possible, keep at least 1 metre distant from other people and do not touch surfaces with your hands. If it is a child who is sick help the child stick to this advice. If you do not live in an area with malaria or dengue fever please do the following:
If you become ill, even with very mild symptoms you must self-isolate 
Even if you don’t think you have been exposed to COVID-19 but develop symptoms, then self-isolate and monitor yourself 
You are more likely to infect others in the early stages of the disease when you just have mild symptoms, therefore early self-isolation is very important.
If you do not have symptoms, but have been exposed to an infected person, self-quarantine for 14 days.
If you have definitely had COVID-19 (confirmed by a test)  self-isolate for 14 days even after symptoms have disappeared as a precautionary measure – it is not yet known exactly how long people remain infectious after they have recovered.

At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.  A small number of pets have been reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after contact with people with COVID-19.
Pets have other types of coronaviruses that can make them sick, like canine and feline coronaviruses. These other coronaviruses cannot infect people and are not related to the current COVID-19 outbreak.
However, since animals can spread other diseases to people, it’s always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, such as washing your hands and maintaining good hygiene.

In confined spaces, droplets spread. The C.D.C. suggests that, while doing the laundry of a sick person, you should wear gloves and try not to shake the clothing, to minimize the possibility of dispersing the virus through the air. If possible, wash items using the warmest water setting, and dry thoroughly. But you can wash their laundry with everyone else’s. 
That being said, the C.D.C. also says that surfaces contaminated with droplets of the virus can infect people, it is “not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.” We know that’s contradictory information. Safe is always better than sorry, though, and if you’re living with someone sick, it’s always good to take precautions.

Often during a crisis, there’s a rising level of conflict between people's sense of their interests over time. At the beginning, everybody gets it. Everybody's on the same side. The way to keep people together is to constantly remind people of the goals: the values at stake and the things that we're trying to work on together. When you remind people of what we all have in common, sometimes the conversation gets a little calmer. (Dutch Leonard, 4/30/20)
As the crisis extends and some of these divisions emerge, you can create new and different kinds of forums for that work to happen. Lincoln did this during the Civil War with some of the people he thought were his worst enemies within the Union—especially politicians and journalists. He sat them down, let them talk and listened to what they had to say. He called these experiences, like those he had with ordinary citizens, who lined up several days a week to see him in the White House, his “public opinion baths,” understanding that not only was he gaining a sense of who were the vocal, influential “doubting Thomases,” but also that he was giving these people a chance to say what they had to say. This allowed him to dial down some of those divisions and to remind people of what they were actually all trying to do.

First, call the health care team. They know your child's health history. The doctor
               will ask how your child is doing and if they've been around someone with known or
               suspected coronavirus. Your doctor's office will tell you what to do next and whether
               you need an in-person visit.
Experts suggest using inhalers for someone who is sick instead of nebulizers
               when possible during the COVID-19 crisis. That's because nebulizers create a mist.
               If someone has the coronavirus and uses a nebulizer, the mist could carry the virus
               to others. If your child uses a nebulizer treatment, talk
               to your care team about whether your child should switch to an inhaler.
If your child can't use an inhaler, try not to have others in the room when using
               the nebulizer. Open a window or do the nebulizer on a porch for better air circulation.
               If you need to help your child use the nebulizer, stay behind them (not in front)
               during the treatment. <SEP> What if My Child Gets Sick? Could It Be COVID-19? <EOS>
If you suspect you have a coronavirus, it’s crucial to contact your doctor or go to the emergency room immediately for a proper diagnosis and treatment. If your doctor does diagnose you with coronavirus, the best natural treatments are getting plenty of rest, drinking lots of fluids, and keeping your environment well-humidified to relieve congestion and soothe your nose and throat. You should also take any medications as prescribed or recommended by your doctor.

The Defence Team will resume certain business activities in a progressive, deliberate, and safe manner within the context of a persistent COVID-19+ environment, in order to ensure the ongoing and future operational effectiveness of the CAF while protecting the health, safety and overall wellness of our personnel.
The Defence Team expects to encounter and has already planned for setbacks and other challenging circumstances during the business resumption process due to the persistent COVID-19+ environment in addition to other variables such as local/regional health realities. This will be mitigated through deliberate planning and coordination while resuming select activities via a limited, asymmetric, decentralized, conditions-based and locally-informed approach across the nation as the level of COVID-19 transmission decreases, and both community and interprovincial movement resumes.
Furthermore, delegation of authorities to local commanders, managers and supervisors will be conducted when and where appropriate to do so and mutual support between regions will be strongly encouraged.  A similar approach will also be utilized for the resumption of our operations abroad in close consultation and coordination with our allies and security partners.
The CDS/DM Directive outlines the resumption of additional limited, but necessary business activities while we continue our Phase 3 response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Notwithstanding the operational imperative to resume specific business activities, the Defence Team will remain pragmatic, safe, and judicious with respect to doing so in order to avoid potentially becoming a vector of COVID-19 transmission in their respective communities and/or inadvertently straining community health systems and related infrastructure. As such, the Phase 3 - Pandemic response will be defined by four stages that are not intended to be executed sequentially and are not mutually exclusive; rather, they will be undertaken in parallel and to varying degrees as changing conditions permit:

Stage 1 – Execution of Business Continuity Plans (BCP) (ongoing). DNDs/CAFs ongoing response and contribution to Whole-of-Nation efforts to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. It includes: Activation and execution of BCPs; CAF support to requests for assistance from Federal, Provincial, Territorial and Indigenous partners as part of Operation LASER; Implementation and maintenance of related Force Health Protection Measures (FHPM) and PHMs; Restrictions on travel, events, and visits; and Cessation of all, but mission essential activities to preserve the force and to ensure continuity of critical operations.  These activities have been further limited by the capacity to execute work remotely and the imperative to stay at home to stay healthy while FHPMs and PHMs to protect the Defence Team have developed and evolved. Stage 1 has also included planning for the resumption of activities as conditions permit and the preparation of workplaces for the eventual return of the Defence Team to them.
Stage 2 – Resumption of Work in an Active COVID-19+ Threat Environment (conditions-based).  With Operation LASER still ongoing, this stage directs additional remote work to commence while physical workplaces are prepared for the eventual return of Defence Team personnel. Furthermore, additional resources are procured, and control measures are developed and implemented to allow for the controlled resumption of critical activities in the workplace at Stage 3 while also setting conditions for optimized activities in a latent COVID-19+ environment. See A6 for workplace preventive/control measures that are to be established to prevent the introduction and spread of COVID-19.
Stage 3 – Resumption of Additional Training and Institutional Activities. In this stage, DND/CAF are still responding to the pandemic and remote work largely continues. Only those activities that are necessary to stop the immediate erosion of CAF readiness (individual training, collective training in support of deployed operations and high readiness contingency forces) and critical supporting and institutional activities that are aligned with established priorities will be undertaken so long as:
Either sufficient public health capacity is in place to test, trace, isolate, and control the spread of the virus or, in its absence, protocols can be developed and adopted to ensure members are not a COVID-19 threat vector or do not get exposed to a COVID-19 threat vector;
Provinces/territories retain sufficient medical capacity to handle illness and where Defence Team personnel will not inadvertently strain health systems and related infrastructure; and
COVID-19 transmission within the community is controlled or, if not, isolation of CAF members and activities is conducted to avoid being a threat vector to the communities where we operate.


Stage 4 – Operations and Activities in a Latent COVID-19 Environment. In this stage, DND/CAF will no longer be responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, but we will not return to a pre-COVID-19 posture. Remote work will continue and workplace occupancy rates will likely remain below pre-COVID-19 pandemic rates. As a rule, our posture in the workplace will generally reflect that of the wider Public Service within similar facilities.  This stage will be defined by the achievement of a new steady state in which the latent threat of COVID-19 persists, but an ability to detect and react decisively to outbreaks exists. <SEP> How will the resumption of business activities be implemented across the Defence Team? <EOS>
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Similar but different coronavirus species cause several common diseases in domestic animals which are not contagious to people. Many dogs, for example, are vaccinated for another species of coronavirus (Canine Coronavirus) as puppies. However, this vaccine does not cross protect for COVID-19. There is no vaccine for COVID-19 for animals or humans at this time. <SEP> I have heard of “coronavirus” infections in dogs, cats, and horses, and even a vaccine in dogs.

​You should learn about each program and consider which one best meets your family's needs. You should also speak with your employer about your options and discuss any benefits they may offer. These programs differ in who is eligible, the amount of benefits you receive, how long you are eligible for those benefits, and how quickly you will receive benefits. In addition, paid sick leave and expanded family medical leave offers you certain job protections. You can learn more about both programs on L&I's COVID-19 Guidance & Resources page.Federal Paid Sick and Expanded Family and Medical LeaveIn general, you are eligible for paid sick leave and expanded family and medical leave if you work for a government entity or work for an employer with fewer than 500 employees. Find out more about your eligibility on U.S. DOL's Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) Eligibility site.  If you are eligible, expanded family and medical leave may be available immediately and allow you to keep receiving a paycheck. Individuals are typically eligible for up to 2/3 of their regular pay, up to $200 per day, for a maximum of $12,000 for 12 weeks. To learn more about this program, visit the U.S. DOLs Families First Coronavirus Response Act site.Eligible individuals using this expanded family and medical leave are generally entitled to be restored to the same or an equivalent position upon returning to work from paid leave status, and may not be fired, disciplined, or discriminated against because they have used this leave.PUAIn general, you are eligible for PUA if you have lost employment and income because of one of the COVID-related reasons identified by federal law, and if you are not currently eligible for regular unemployment compensation.If you apply for and are eligible for PUA, the amount of PUA benefits you will receive is based on your previous income reported, not less than $195 and not more than $572. You may be eligible for up to 39 weeks of PUA benefits. You must first apply for regular unemployment compensation and be denied before you may apply for PUA. After applying for PUA, it may take additional time for your first benefit check to arrive. To learn more about PUA in Pennsylvania, visit L&I's PUA FAQ page. <SEP> ​My child's school, place of care, or childcare facility has closed or is opened for only some days because of COVID-19 and I must reduce my hours at work or leave my job because I am the primary caregiver.

The Virginia Department of Health recommends restricting contact with pets and other animals while sick with COVID-19. Although there have only been extremely rare reports of pets, or other animals, becoming sick with COVID-19, it is still recommended to limit contact with mammalian animals until more information is known about the virus. When possible, have another person care for the animal. If the patient must care for, or be around animals, while sick, it is recommended they wash their hands before and after animal interactions and wear a facemask. See additional information under “Animals and COVID-19” <SEP> What do I need to know if a patient with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 asks about having a pet or other animal in the home? <EOS>
You can stop quarantining or isolating 10 days after you recover. If over a day has passed without a fever and 10 days have passed without any other symptoms, you can start going out and about again. If you’re asymptomatic, quarantine for 10 days before going outside again. 
Make sure that your fever has gone away on its own and not because of fever-reducing medication. <SEP> When is it safe to go outside again after I’ve had symptoms? <EOS>
As testing of individuals for COVID-19 increases, so does the need for contact tracers to conduct interviews with individuals who may have come into contact with those who tested positive. It is estimated that at least 1,000 and as many as 5,000 contact tracers may be needed in New Jersey.
To meet this need and expand on the existing group of 800-900 contact tracers, the State is developing a Community Contact Tracing Corps with a two-stage approach:

Partnering with the State's higher education institutions to train public health graduate students and alumni to engage in contact tracing activities in their home communities. In partnership with Rutgers University, led by their School of Public Health and including the School of Health Professions, School of Nursing, School of Social Work, and Graduate School of Applied and Professional Psychology, we will launch the corps and create several hundred jobs. We will also be expanding the effort to include other colleges and universities throughout the state.
In June, the State issued a Request for Quotes (RFQ) to solicit proposals from vendors, organizations, and institutions to help expand the Corps across the state. In late July, Public Consulting Group (PCG) was chosen to recruit, employ, and manage contact tracers who can be deployed to areas with increasing COVID-19 cases. PCG will work to ensure that as many of these new contact tracers as possible come from and reflect the diversity of the communities they will be working in. All individuals will be required to complete the Contact Tracing training developed with Rutgers School of Public Health.

As of August 21, there are over 1,600 contact tracers working in the state, including existing local health department staff as well as newly trained contact tracers deployed locally. The State's newest contact tracers come from every one of our 21 counties and speak nearly two-dozen languages.
Across the state, there is an average of 18.1 contact tracers on-the-ground for every 100,000 residents as of August 21. More contact tracers will be added until every county has 15 contact tracers per 100,000 residents, and then the State will seek to double that.
For more on where contact tracers are working and the latest information on their efforts, visit the Department of Health's COVID-19 dashboard.
Meanwhile, in partnership with Dimagi, we will deploy their open source CommCare platform across New Jersey to centralize the State's contact tracing efforts.
Collecting information in a uniform way makes it easier for health officials to share information and to track the virus across New Jersey. When time is of the essence, we cannot lose any of it trying to work across different platforms. It will also ensure connectivity with contact tracers with our neighbors, including New York State and Philadelphia.
No one outside of our contact-tracing program will have access to CommCare, and all information is off-loaded after 45 days to the state's epidemiological database.
Above all, you are the key to our ability to stop the spread of COVID-19.
If you are called by a contact tracer, we need you to answer the phone so we can let you know about the risk to you and your family and provide you with information to protect your loved ones and your community.
You will be asked to share your close contacts. That information is used ONLY for the purpose of helping those people to get tested or to quarantine. Your information is confidential. Your name will not be released to your contacts or your COVID-19 status – that information will only be known to public health officials and our local health department partners, if needed.
Together, we can save lives and stop the spread of COVID-19.

 We are aware of stakeholder interest in how AHCCCS plans to use the enhanced federal funding available through the Families First Coronavirus Response Act.  We continue to evaluate how to best use the funds, in light of the expected member growth due to the COVID-19 emergency.  In order to receive the match, AHCCCS is required not to disenroll members, and expects membership growth as the existing members remain enrolled and new members are added.  As such, AHCCCS must first ensure that the additional funding will cover the cost of the enrollment growth that will occur. AHCCCS is prohibited from disenrolling members through the end of the month in which the declaration ends. <SEP>  How does AHCCCS plan to use the additional 6.2 % in federal matching funds appropriated for Medicaid programs under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act? <EOS>
CDC has interim guidance for home care for clinically stable individuals who do not require hospitalization. VDH has also created a protocol for PPE for HCPs involved in COVID-19 active monitoring in residential settings.
CDC has guidance for preventing the spread of COVID-19 in LTCFs.

Similarly, what guidance are you giving to skilled nursing facilities? <EOS>
Early on, many of the patients in the outbreak in Wuhan, China reportedly had some link to a large seafood and animal market, suggesting initial animal-to-person spread. Now, person-to-person spread is occurring. <SEP> Has the cause of COVID-19 been identified? <EOS>
 COVID-19 illness is spread mainly from person to person through respiratory droplets (mucous from the nose and throat) when a person who has COVID-19 illness coughs or sneezes and another person comes into contact with the infectious droplets. This is how the flu and many other respiratory illnesses spread. Respiratory droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be breathed into the lungs. Spread of the virus is more likely when people are at a close distance, such as within about 6 feet. Some information has been reported that the virus that causes COVID-19 is in the fecal matter (bowel movements) of infected patients. While CDC does not report this as a clearly understood way the virus is transmitted, it remains important to wash your hands after using the restroom. In some environments, the virus that causes COVID-19 can survive on surfaces, so regular sanitation of shared surfaces is important. <SEP>  How is COVID-19 transmitted? <EOS>
The total number of cases includes both confirmed and probable cases.  
Cases are considered confirmed when there has been a positive molecular amplification test (such as PCR) performed by a lab. 
A case is  considered probable when it : 
	(1) Meets clinical criteria* AND there is epidemiologic evidence,**  but no lab test to confirm.OR
(2) Meets clinical criteria* AND tested positive using an antigen or serologic test. OR
(3) A person has an epidemiologic link** AND has tested positive using an antigen or serologic testOR
(4) A death certificate lists COVID-19 disease or SARS-CoV-2 as a cause of death or a significant condition contributing to death, but there is no lab test to confirm.
		*Clinical criteria: patient must have one of the following AND no alternative more likely diagnosis: (1) at least two of the following symptoms: fever, chills, rigors, myalgia, headache, sore throat, new olfactory and taste disorder(s) OR (2) at least one of the following symptoms: cough, shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing OR severe respiratory illness with at least one of the following: clinical or radiographic evidence of pneumonia, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
**An epidemiological link is close contact with a confirmed or probable case of COVID-19 disease OR travel to or residence in an area with sustained, ongoing community transmission OR a member of a risk group as defined by public health authorities during an outbreak.


A person can test negative for COVID-19 and still be counted as a probable case if they meet the probable case definition, which is (1) “meets clinical criteria* AND epidemiologic evidence,**  but no lab test to confirm.”
	CDPHE interprets “no confirmatory laboratory testing” as the absence of a positive test, not the absence of any test.  
There are many reasons a test can produce a false negative result. This can happen when a person is tested too early in the incubation period or too long after symptoms improve and there isn't enough viral material for the test to detect. It can also happen if a sample was collected improperly or not handled or stored at proper temperatures. 
If the negative test is accompanied by a low suspicion of COVID-19 or a more likely alternative diagnosis, the person should not be counted as a probable case. <SEP> What’s the difference between confirmed and probable cases? <EOS>
Testing is now available to everyone in New Jersey.
It's especially important to get tested if:

You are experiencing symptoms (fever, cough, shortness of breath, chills, sore throat, muscle pain, shivering, headache, or new loss of taste or smell)
You have been in close contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19
You are an essential worker (health care worker, first responder, food service worker, or transit worker)
You were recently in a large crowd where social distancing was hard to maintain
You recently travelled to an area or a state with high COVID-19 infection rates

Learn more about the different kinds of testing sites below, and find your nearest testing location here.
NOTE: Some testing sites require an appointment in advance. Please check with a testing site before going to see what their hours and requirements are.
LOCAL TESTING SITES
Local testing sites have been set up across New Jersey. These sites may be restricted to residents of a specific county or municipality, or to first responders. Some also require an appointment and/or prescription from a healthcare provider. Please check with your local testing site for its specific requirements.
You can find more information about these sites including their locations, hours, and testing requirements here.
PHARMACY TESTING SITES
The State has authorized the more than 18,000 licensed pharmacists in New Jersey to administer FDA-approved or authorized COVID-19 tests to their customers without a prescription.
Testing is available at participating pharmacies including CVS, Rite-Aid, and Walmart. Please check with your local pharmacist as testing is not available at all locations and many require an appointment or online registration.
For more information, CVS, Rite-Aid and Walmart have set up websites where you can book an appointment and find testing locations.
PRIVATE TESTING SITES
Commercial labs are offering COVID-19 testing to individuals who meet certain criteria. However, these tests are not available directly to the general public. They must be ordered by a health care provider, who will order the test from the lab or provide you with a prescription to show the laboratory.
FIRST RESPONDER AND HEALTH CARE WORKER TESTING SITES
Both career and volunteer first responders and health care workers can also access appointment-only, drive thru testing sites in the Meadowlands, Deptford, and Somerset. These sites have been opened by the New Jersey State Policemen's Benevolent Association, in partnership with Accurate Diagnostic Labs: njpba.adlabscovidtest.com <SEP> What’s the difference between local testing, pharmacy testing sites, and private testing sites? <EOS>
Work with your local health officials to determine a set of strategies appropriate for your community’s situation. Continue using the preparedness strategies implemented for no community transmission, and consider the following social distancing strategies:

Cancel field trips, assemblies, and other large gatherings.
Cancel or modify classes where students are likely to be in very close contact.
Increase the space between desks to at least 6 feet.
Stagger arrival and/or dismissal times.
Reduce congestion in the health office.
Limit nonessential visitors.
Limit bringing in students from other schools for special programs (e.g., music, robotics, academic clubs)
Teach staff, students, and their families to maintain a safe distance (6 feet) from each other in the school. <SEP> How should my school prepare when there is minimal to moderate community transmission in our area? <EOS>
Generally, the considerations may be different. The allocation of different resources may find
ethical justifications in different principles or values. For instance, once a novel vaccine is
found to be safe and effective, to prioritize those at highest risk, as well as populations like
health care workers who may be more likely to serve as vectors for transmission, is justified.Within those subgroups, some suggest that a lottery-based (i.e., random) allocation may be
justified, given that resources will be limited and we can assume nearly equal benefits will be
derived from any recipient within that group. This is not the case, however, for other
resources such as ventilators, where some individuals may derive significantly more benefit
than others. <SEP> Are the ethical considerations the same for all medical countermeasures, including therapeutics, vaccines and personal protective equipment (PPE)? <EOS>
 Yes. After the healthcare provider tells the patient that they have a positive result, ADPH contacts the patient to conduct an investigation called a contact interview. They find out where the person has been and who they have been in contact with. Follow-up with contacts are then made. <SEP>  When people test positive, are those who have been in contact with them notified? <EOS>

It remains the case that you should not:

socialise indoors in groups of more than two households (anyone in your support bubble counts as one household) – this includes when dining out or going to the pub
socialise outdoors in a group of more than six people from different households; gatherings larger than six should only take place if everyone is from exclusively from two households or support bubbles
interact socially with anyone outside the group you are attending a place with, even if you see other people you know, for example, in a restaurant, community centre or place of worship
hold or attend celebrations (such as parties) where it is difficult to maintain social distancing and avoid close social interaction – even if they are organised by businesses and venues that are taking steps to follow COVID-19 Secure guidelines
stay overnight away from your home with members of more than one other household (your support bubble counts as one household)

It is against the law for gatherings of more than 30 people to take place in private homes (including gardens and other outdoor spaces). Businesses and venues following COVID-19 Secure guidelines can host larger groups provided they comply with the law. This can include weddings, civil partnership ceremonies and funerals (which we advise should be limited to no more than 30 people), religious ceremonies and services, community activities and support groups. If attending a place or event that is following COVID-19 Secure guidelines, you should take care to limit your interactions with anyone outside of your group and you should continue to maintain social distancing from those that you do not live with. It is critical that you follow these guidelines to keep both yourself and others safe. The government will be introducing fines for those who facilitate or organise illegal gatherings of over 30 people.
Please consult the local restrictions page to see if any restrictions are in place in your area. In some areas, it will be illegal to meet people you do not live with inside a private home or garden, except where you have formed a support bubble (or for other limited exemptions to be specified in law). <SEP> 1.3 What should I still avoid doing? <EOS>
Explain to your friends why it is important to protect themselves and others by washing their hands, avoiding touching their face, always coughing or sneezing into their elbow, sleeve, or a tissue, and cooperating with physical distancing measures and movement restrictions when called on to do so. Maybe you can share ideas for fun virtual activities that your friends can participate in,  and you can encourage them to do them together with you or with other friends. This way you are giving them alternatives rather than just telling them to stay at home. But, remember that you do not have control over other peoples’ actions so do not get into an argument or a fight to try to change their minds. <SEP> Some of my friends are not sticking to the rules about physical distancing. What should I do? <EOS>
The most common signs of COVID-19 are a fever,
               cough, and trouble breathing. Some people might have:

symptoms of a cold such as a sore
               throat, congestion, or a runny nose
chills
muscle pain
headache
a loss of taste or smell
nausea or vomiting
diarrhea
tiredness

Some kids are having symptoms caused by inflammation
               throughout the body, sometimes several weeks after they were infected with the virus.
               This is called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in
               children (MIS-C). Doctors are trying to find out how these symptoms are related
               to coronavirus infection.
Symptoms of MIS-C can include:

fever 
belly pain
vomiting or diarrhea
neck pain
a rash
red eyes
feeling very tired
red, cracked lips
swollen hands or feet
swollen lymph nodes

Most kids with MIS-C get better after they get special care in the hospital, sometimes

Travel increases your chance of getting and spreading COVID-19. COVID-19 risk in most countries is high, and travelers should avoid nonessential travel to high-risk destinations. Travelers at increased risk for severe illness should consider postponing all travel, including essential travel, to high-risk destinations. To check a destination’s COVID-19 risk level see COVID-19 Travel Recommendations by Destination.
Some healthcare systems are overwhelmed and there may be limited access to adequate medical care in affected areas. Many countries are implementing travel restrictions and mandatory quarantines, closing borders, and prohibiting non-citizens from entry with little advance notice. If you choose to travel internationally, your travel plans may be disrupted. If you get sick or are exposed to a person with COVID-19 during your trip, you may be isolated or quarantined and your return to the United States may be delayed.
CDC also recommends all travelers defer all cruise ship travel worldwide. <SEP> I am planning to travel internationally. Should I cancel my trip? <EOS>
COVID-19 is a new disease and CDC is learning more about it every day. Among adults, the risk for severe illness from COVID-19 increases with age, with older adults at highest risk. Severe illness means that the person with COVID-19 may require hospitalization, intensive care, or a ventilator to help them breathe, or they may even die. People of any age with certain underlying medical conditions are also at increased risk for severe illness from SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Based on what we know at this time, pregnant people might be at an increased risk for severe illness from SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with non-pregnant people. Additionally, there may be an increased risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth, among people who get sick with COVID-19 during pregnancy.

African Americans are more likely to acquire and die from complications of the COVID-19 virus because Blacks suffer from higher rates of chronic medical conditions like diabetes and obesity, high blood pressure, heart and kidney disease and asthma. All of these lower the immune system and the ability to fight off viruses. Additionally, lifestyle factors like being an essential worker and even using public transportation increase the risk of getting COVID-19. <SEP> Are certain racial or ethnic groups at a higher risk of developing severe illness with COVID-19? <EOS>
NIH is providing maximum flexibility and will accept these requests from recipients affected by COVID-19.

 Currently, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.  A small number of pets have been reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after contact with people with COVID-19. <SEP>  Can I get COVID-19 from my pet? <EOS>
Yes, you should wear a mask whenever you are in a public place where you will encounter other people. The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 can spread between people interacting in close proximity — for example, speaking, coughing, sneezing, or singing— even if those people do not symptoms.

Providers entering a room after a patient exits should use respiratory protection.
Airborne infection isolation room (AIIR): If the change rate is known, leave the room empty for enough air changes per hour (ACH) to occur, to clear the room of infectious particles.
Regular exam room: In settings where an AIIR is unavailable, providers can examine patients in a closed room while wearing appropriate PPE. It is unknown how long SARS-CoV-2 remains infectious in the air. In the interim, it is reasonable to wait two hours, which is commonly used for pathogens spread by the airborne route (e.g., measles, tuberculosis). The room should undergo appropriate cleaning and surface disinfection before it is returned to routine use. <SEP> How should we treat an exam room after the person with COVID-19 exits? <EOS>
On June 30, 2020 Governor Northam signed Executive Order 67. This Order became effective at 12:00 a.m., Wednesday, July 1, 2020 and shall remain in full force and effect until amended or rescinded by further executive order. Under Executive Order 67, all public and private in-person gatherings of more than 250 individuals are prohibited. However, your region/locality may have stricter restrictions in place. Please review your local government’s website and all of Governor Northam’s current Executive Orders to determine what restrictions are in place in your locality. Event planners are encouraged to confer with local government and public health leadership about any planned events.
Signs should be posted at the entrance to the event stating that no one with a fever or symptoms of COVID-19, or known exposure to a COVID-19 case in the prior 14 days, is permitted in the establishment. Signs should also be posted to provide public health reminders regarding physical distancing, gatherings, options for high-risk individuals, and staying home if sick. Example signage is available in the VDH Business Toolkit. Further guidelines for social gatherings can be found in the Guidelines for All Business Sectors (p. 5-7). Guidance from the CDC for Events and Gatherings can be found here. <SEP> I am planning a large event.

Again, no one really knows. The Trump administration is unlikely to allow laid-off holders of H-1B and other work visas to extend their stay in the country amid the coronavirus pandemic. Many have been waiting in a backlog for several years to obtain permanent legal residency through their employer, and now face the prospect of deportation.
The temporary suspension of work visas is opposed by a lot of businesses — including tech companies in Silicon Valley and manufacturers — whose leaders say it will block their ability to recruit workers for jobs that Americans are not willing or able to perform. Foreign doctors are willing to come help, but most cannot get into the country. 
If you can, get in touch with an immigration lawyer and your employer. There may be legal recourse, and some attorneys are working on such cases for free. <SEP> I have a work visa. What’s going on with that? <EOS>
Medical masks (also known as surgical masks): these are made from a minimum of three layers of synthetic nonwoven materials, and configured to have filtration layers sandwiched in the middle. These masks are available in different thicknesses, have various levels of fluid-resistance and two levels of filtration. These medical masks reduce the respiratory droplets from the wearer to others and to the environment. They also prevent transmission of the virus from others to the wearer. Hands should be cleaned with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water before putting on a clean mask and after removing the mask. These masks should be worn tightly on the face. The wearer should avoid touching the mask while it is on the face and the mask should be immediately discarded if it becomes moist. Importantly, wearing a mask must be combined with other preventive measures including performing frequent hand hygiene and physical distancing of at least 1 metre.When and how to use masksRespirators (also known as filtering facepiece respirators - FFP) and available at different performance levels such as FFP2, FFP3, N95, N99): these are specifically designed for healthcare workers who provide care to COVID-19 patients in settings and areas where aerosol generating procedures are undertaken. Healthcare workers should be fit tested before using a respirator to ensure that they are wearing the correct size.Non-medical masks (also known as fabric masks, home-made masks, DIY masks) can act as a barrier to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others.They can be purchased commercially or handmade, and are generally not standardized like medical masks. There are numerous types of fabric masks, they should cover the nose, mouth, and chin and be secured with elastic loops or ties, include multiple layers, be washable and reusable.Remember, the use of a fabric mask alone is not sufficient to provide an adequate level of protection. Maintain a minimum physical distance of at least 1 metre from others, frequently clean your hands and continue to avoid touching your face and the mask.WHO will be referring to non-medical masks as fabric masks.When and how to use masks <SEP> What types of masks are used against the spread of COVID-19? <EOS>
You should keep using their standard infection control plans and use PPE as needed.

We are still learning about this virus, but it appears that it can spread from people to animals in some situations. Until we learn more about this new coronavirus, you should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would with people. When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick.
If you are sick with COVID-19, avoid contact with your pet, including petting, snuggling, being kissed or licked, or sharing food or bedding.
If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets and wear a mask.

The CDC notes that symptoms of the novel coronavirus include “fever and symptoms of lower respiratory illness (e.g., cough, difficulty breathing).” Avoid contact with someone who is suspected of having the virus. <SEP> What are the symptoms of the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19)? <EOS>
Not yet. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019. However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should be hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care.
Possible vaccines and some specific drug treatments are under investigation. They are being tested through clinical trials. WHO is coordinating efforts to develop vaccines and medicines to prevent and treat COVID-19.
The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue, and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing. (See Basic protective measures against the new coronavirus). <SEP> Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19? <EOS>
Yes. HCP who have any kind of exposure for which home quarantine is recommended should be excluded from work:

If HCP are able to quarantine away from the infected individual living with them, they should quarantine at home and not come into work for 14 days following their last exposure to the infected individual.
If HCP are not able to quarantine away from the infected individual living with them and have ongoing unprotected exposure throughout the duration of the individual’s illness, they should remain in home quarantine and be excluded from work until 14 days after the infected individual meets criteria for discontinuation of home isolation.
If HCP develop SARS-CoV-2 infection while they are in quarantine, they should be excluded from work until they meet all return to work criteria for HCP with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Home quarantine and work exclusion of asymptomatic exposed HCP who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection in the prior 3 months might not be necessary.  Additional information about this scenario is available here. <SEP> If healthcare personnel (HCP) are living with someone who has been diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection, should they be excluded from work?

Quarantine is necessary to slow down transmission and prevent further spread. For most people, the coronavirus is about as bad as having the flu. Older people and people with weakened immune systems are more at risk of complications like pneumonia, so herd immunity plays a big part in it. <SEP> If coronavirus isn't that deadly, why have they quarantined Italy and warned people not to get on cruise ships or planes? <EOS>
An N95 FFR is a type of respirator which removes particles from the air that are breathed through it. These respirators filter out at least 95% of very small (0.3 micron) particles.

Routine influenza surveillance in China has identified a strain of swine flu (called the G4 variant) circulating in pig populations that has the potential to infect people. There are no reports of human illness associated with this strain of swine flu at this time. In order for a pandemic to occur, one key factor is the ability of a virus to successfully pass from person-to-person and there is no indication that that is currently happening with this virus. Additionally, the U.S. has a robust national influenza surveillance program in place to quickly detect and respond to new strains of influenza. There is no indication that the G4 swine flu variant is circulating in pigs or people in the U.S. at this time. <SEP> I heard that a strain of swine flu is circulating in China that has pandemic potential.

We don't know for certain if the COVID-19 virus spreads through air conditioning. But we do know that when it's hot and humid, people are more likely to stay indoors, with the windows closed — giving the virus more opportunity to spread.Coronavirus spreads through droplets that an infected person emits through coughs or sneezes and through smaller, infectious viral particles that can drift around in the air for several hours. Outdoors, air currents can scatter and dilute the virus, making transmission less likely. You're more likely to inhale the virus indoors, with the windows closed, whether or not you have the air conditioning on.If you must be indoors with anyone outside of your household, increase air circulation by keeping the windows open as much as possible. <SEP> Can the COVID-19 virus spread through air conditioning? <EOS>

In general, children aged 5 years and under should not be required to wear masks. This advice is based on the safety and overall interest of the child and the capacity to appropriately use a mask with minimal assistance. There may be local requirements for children aged 5 years and under to wear masks, or specific needs in some settings, such as being physically close to someone who is ill. In these circumstances, if the child wears a mask, a parent or other guardian should be within direct line of sight to supervise the safe use of the mask. <SEP> Are there situations where children aged 5 years and under may wear or be required to wear a mask? <EOS>
Elective surgeries are permitted to resume in New Jersey.
Guidance for Hospitals and Ambulatory Surgery Centers
The Department of Health has issued guidance for hospitals and for ambulatory surgery centers to begin resuming surgeries.
Facilities resuming elective services are required to take additional steps to protect health care workers and patients including:

Comply with state and CDC guidelines to protect against further spread of COVID-19;
Facilities must test each patient seeking these procedures within a 96-hour maximum before a scheduled procedure with a preoperative COVID-19 RT-PCR test and ensure COVID-19 negative status;
Institute screening of staff for symptoms and have policies in place for removal of symptomatic employees;
Enforce social distancing requirements in work and common areas;
Require masks for patients, except patients receiving services that would not allow for masking;
When possible, establish non-COVID care zones in facilities that serve both COVID-19 and non-COVID patients;
Have an established plan for cleaning and disinfection prior to using facilities to serve non-COVID patients;
Facilities providing COVID-19 care should continue to be prepared for potential surges;
Facilities should be prepared to modify resumptions of clinical services in conjunction with surge status and to repurpose and redeploy staff to urgent care roles to the extent feasible.

In addition, ambulatory Surgical Centers should not perform procedures on COVID-19 positive patients. Facilities must also have a plan for patient and patient support person use of PPE. Facilities must implement disinfection and cleaning protocols and cohort COVID-19 patients and non-COVID patients.
For more detailed information, refer to the Department of Health's requirements for hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers to resume elective surgeries.
Guidance for Dentists, Optometrists, and other Health Care Offices
The New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs has released guidance for health care professional offices, private practices, clinics, urgent care centers, community medical centers to resume elective surgeries.
Requirements include, but are not limited to:

Utilizing telemedicine to the greatest extent possible to treat, order tests and triage patients.
Calling all patients seeking in-person appointments (or the patient's parent or guardian) to: (1) assess whether an in-person visit is necessary; (2) determine the patient's current health status; (3) determine whether the patient has had known exposure to COVID-19, or has compatible symptoms, or has tested positive; (4) determine the length of time since the onset of symptoms or from the positive test results; and (5) advise the patient during scheduling of in-person appointments of the face-covering requirement below.
Prioritizing services that, if deferred, are most likely to result in patient harm.
Prioritizing at-risk populations who would benefit most from those services.
Requiring anyone coming to the office for an in-person visit to wear, at a minimum, a cloth face covering
Screening all patients upon arrival, regardless of symptoms, by means of a no-contact temperature check or thermometers with disposable covers, and record the result within the patient chart.
Spacing appointments to minimize patient-to-patient contact and the number of people in the office at any given time. If feasible and consistent with social distancing, patients should remain in their cars or outside until they are ready to be seen, or wait in separate rooms to minimize contact with other patients.
Scheduling patients with known exposure or compatible symptoms for the end of the day or in a dedicated room.

Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease. Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure. For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure, because 14 days is the longest incubation period seen for similar coronaviruses. Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period.

Every test has a particular false-negative rate, and sometimes a false-positive rate, and results may differ when tests are taken on different days. When people are just getting sick, false negatives are not uncommon. If someone has symptoms and test results are inconclusive, physicians should treat the person like they're positive. Sometimes, when there's enough of a story—e.g., someone says, "I've lost my sense of smell. I'm coughing”—even if the test is negative, you treat it like a case.

You could, if only for the story, do it yourself. A buzz cut is … possible, although perhaps ill-advised. And the beard? Chances are that it’s not nearly as cute as you think it is.
But fixing a ’do is one of the most beloved types of self-care there is. Even when you’re visible only on Zoom, split ends and straggly edges can crimp your confidence. When barbershops reopened in New York City, people came rushing back.
If you go to a salon, make sure you and your hairdresser or barber are both wearing masks. They have to get close to you, so be extra careful. Also, unless you’re getting your hair done outside, make sure they have fans running and windows open, to keep air moving through the space.
To keep yourself safe, shampoo your hair at home, so your stylist doesn’t have to bend down over you. Wait for the appointment outside and keep the haircut time short. Skip the blowdry. 
That’s true for getting your hair colored, too. Step outside while the chemicals are taking, and wash your own hair out.
And, ah, masks. But what about the hair behind my ears? That’s an easy fix. Either settle for a not-so-close shave this time, or unloop one ear at a time, holding your mask to your face. Safety first. Vanity second. <SEP> What about getting a haircut? <EOS>

As part of routine practices, healthcare personnel (HCP) should be applying Standard Precautions. HCP should always deliberately assess potential risks of exposure to infectious material before engaging in activities and procedures in healthcare delivery. Based on their risk assessment, safe work practices, including engineering controls that reduce the release of infectious material, administrative controls, and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) should be implemented at the point of care according to CDC guidelines and standards of practice for the activity performed.
To reduce SARS-CoV-2 exposure during the COVID-19 pandemic, CDC recommends that facilities:

consider nonoperative approaches when feasible;
minimize the use of procedures or techniques that might produce infectious aerosols when feasible;
minimize the number of people in the operating or procedure room to reduce exposures;
use the extent of community transmission and an assessment of the likelihood for patient harm if care is delayed to make decisions about cancelling or postponing elective surgeries and procedures; and
implement universal source control measures, which includes having patients wear a cloth face covering (as tolerated) and having HCP wear a facemask at all times while they are in the healthcare facility.

If surgery or procedures cannot be postponed, HCP caring for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should adhere to all recommended infection prevention and control practices for COVID-19.  This includes:

Using all recommended PPE: an N95 or equivalent or higher-level respirator (or facemask if respirators are not available), eye protection, gloves, and a gown.

Respirators with exhalation valves should not be used during surgical procedures as unfiltered exhaled breath would compromise the sterile field.
If shortages exist, N95 or equivalent or higher-level respirators should be prioritized for procedures involving higher risk techniques (e.g., that generate potentially infectious aerosols) or that involve anatomic regions where viral loads might be higher (e.g., nose and throat, oropharynx, respiratory tract).


As part of routine practice, HCP should also be using additional engineering controls for source control, when applicable (e.g., smoke evacuation devices).

Because SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted by individuals who are infected but do not have symptoms, some infected individuals will not be identified by screening for clinical signs and symptoms.  HCP providing surgical or procedural care to patients not suspected of having SARS-CoV-2 infection should use a tiered approach based on the level of community transmission to inform the need for universal eye protection and respirator use.  HCP should continue to use eye protection or an N95 or equivalent or higher-level respirator whenever recommended for patient care as a part of Standard or Transmission-Based Precautions.
In addition to the use of universal PPE and source control in healthcare settings, targeted SARS-CoV-2 testing of patients without signs or symptoms of COVID-19 might be used to identify those with asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and further reduce risk for exposures in some healthcare settings. Depending on guidance from local and state health departments, testing availability, and how rapidly results are available, facilities can consider implementing pre-admission or pre-procedure diagnostic testing with authorized nucleic acid or antigen detection assays for SARS-CoV-2.
Testing results might inform decisions about rescheduling elective procedures or about the need for additional Transmission-Based Precautions when caring for the patient. Limitations of using this testing strategy include obtaining negative results in patients during their incubation period who later become infectious and false negative test results, depending on the test method used. <SEP> During the COVID-19 pandemic, are there special considerations for surgical and other procedural care settings, including performance of aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs)? <EOS>
Cough or sneeze into your elbow or use a tissue. If you use a tissue, dispose of it carefully after a single use
Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.

Charter and fishing guide operations that involve boats, canoes and other marine vessels may operate provided they:

Maintain six feet of distance from one another, to the extent possible. When boat size or fishing activities might not allow for proper social distancing, masks and other personal protection equipment must be worn.  
Ensure the use of personal protective equipment such as gloves, goggles, face shields, and face masks as appropriate for the activity being performed.
Adopt protocols to limit the sharing of tools and equipment to the maximum extent possible and to ensure frequent and thorough cleaning of tools, equipment, and frequently touched surfaces.

In addition to the DNR Law Enforcement Division, Michigan State Police and local law enforcement agencies have full authority to enforce the provisions of this order.

The best way to protect yourself from COVID-19 is to avoid being around people who are sick with the disease. However, if the person is asymptomatic, you may have no way of knowing if they have the disease until you've already contracted the virus. Other steps you can take to minimize your exposure include: 

Washing your hands for at least 20 seconds with soap and water after going to the bathroom, before eating, and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing
Distancing yourself from others and spending most of your time at home
Touching your eyes, nose, and mouth as little as possible
Staying home if you are sick (even if you just have a common cold)
Cleaning and disinfecting all surfaces that are frequently touched in your household at least once a day
Covering your cough or sneeze with a tissue and immediately throwing the tissue in the trash
Be wary of suspicious phone calls or emails related to COVID-19 that are requesting money or information from you or asking you to click a link. There has been an increase in these scams recently where criminals pretend to be from the CDC. <SEP> How can I protect myself from COVID-19? <EOS>

Overall, it is difficult to predict when cases will diminish, particularly in the US. Some experts have suggested a seasonal role. Infectious disease physician at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security Amesh Adalja suggests that COVID-19 is akin to the seasonal cold and predicts some "tapering off of cases" as we head into spring and summer in the northern hemisphere, while the virus may have increased transmission in parts of the southern hemisphere. Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Dr. Anthony Fauci is also hopeful that cases will diminish as the weather becomes warmer, but both he and others caution that we don't have enough information to predict the seasonal behavior of the virus (see Australia, which is currently in its warm season, yet still experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks).
If we look to the timelines of other countries for comparison: in the US, the rapidly increasing number of cases resembles the beginning of an exponential curve - similar to Italy. However, cases in China and South Korea are beginning to decrease, suggesting they may have begun to "plateau." It took approximately two months for China to reach this stage from the beginning of the outbreak and South Korea roughly half a month, although due to differences in response times, testing, and approaches to tracing cases / public health interventions, it may be difficult to extrapolate what has happened in other countries to the US.
In the US, it is difficult to tell when the peak will arrive, partly due to the limitations in testing. Additionally, we may see second or third waves of outbreaks even after cases begin to decrease. Therefore, while it may not be unreasonable to hope for an end sometime in late April or May based on these predictions and cases, we simply do not have enough information to say for certain.

A cloth face covering is a material that covers the nose and mouth. It can be secured to the head with ties or straps or simply wrapped around the lower face. It can be made of a variety of materials, such as cotton, silk or linen.
A cloth face covering may be factory-made, sewn by hand or improvised from household items such as scarfs, T-shirts, sweatshirts or towels.
Ideally, a face covering has two or more layers. These face coverings are not intended for use by healthcare providers in the care of patients.
Surgical masks, procedure masks and N95 respirators are not recommended for general public use or use in community settings, as these should be reserved for specific high-risk occupational settings, health care providers and other medical first responders in a health care setting. <SEP> What is a cloth face covering? <EOS>
WHO guidelines are to maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) between fellow workers. Where the food production environment makes it difficult to do so, employers need to consider what measures to put in place to protect employees. Examples of practical measures to adhere to physical distancing guidance in the food processing environment are to:stagger workstations on either side of processing lines so that food workers are not facing one another,provide personal protection equipment (PPE) such as face masks, hair nets, disposable gloves, clean overalls and slip reduction work shoes for staff. The use of PPE would be routine in high risk areas of food premises that produce ready-to-eat and cooked foods. When staff are dressed in PPE it is possible to reduce distance between workers,space out workstations, which may require reduction in the speed of production lines,limit the number of staff in a food preparation area at any one time,organise staff into working groups or teams to facilitate reduced interaction between groups, including during change of work shifts. <SEP> How should employees maintain safe distance from one another during food production and processing? <EOS>
Health departments should have a plan on how to prioritize facilities when testing capacity is limited.
Priority facilities may include those with confirmed cases, those in counties with high incidence, those with the ability to cohort residents who are found to be positive, larger facilities, and facilities with more patients with recent healthcare exposures (e.g., recent hospitalization or outpatient dialysis).
If a facility identifies additional cases through facility-wide testing, then that facility should be prioritized for repeat testing of negative residents. <SEP> How can public health jurisdictions prioritize testing across nursing homes? <EOS>
An antiviral drug must be able to target the specific part of a virus’s life cycle that is necessary for it to reproduce, according to Harvard Medical School.

Masks or cloth coverings can be purchased or handmade. There is not a list of approved vendors. When buying or making a face covering, remember to check that it meets the following requirements:

Completely covers the mouth and nose.
Is not overly tight or restrictive.
The face covering must not be made of mesh or other fabric with holes and must not have a valve designed to facilitate easy exhaling or other openings, holes, visible gaps in the design or material, or vents.

Large-scale emergency health measures prevented more than 500 million COVID-19 infections in six countries between January and early April 2020, according to a peer-reviewed article published in the journal Nature. The study authors looked at the impact of policies designed to slow the spread of the virus in six countries: the United States, China, South Korea, Italy, Iran, and France. They compared the growth rate of COVID-19 infections in each country before and after the policies — such as travel restrictions; business, school, and restaurant closures; and social distancing — were enacted.These findings reinforce the importance of continuing to exercise caution and practice health-promoting behaviors as restrictions begin to ease. <SEP> How many COVID-19 infections may have been prevented because of policies designed to slow the spread of the virus? <EOS>

Temperature screening cannot detect all cases of COVID-19, since infected individuals may not have fever early in the course of infection or illness, such as during the incubation period or just before other symptoms begin, even though they may already be infectious. Some people may reduce fever with a fever-reducing medication if they are concerned about the possible consequences of not coming to work. Relying on temperature screening alone will not stop the spread of COVID-19 at work. Thermal screening at the workplace can be considered part of a package of measures to prevent and control COVID-19 at the workplace. Workers should be encouraged to self-monitor their health, possibly with the use of questionnaires, and take their own temperature regularly at home. Workplaces should adopt “stay at home if unwell” and flexible sick leave policies to discourage workers with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 from coming to the workplaces. <SEP> Does WHO recommend thermal testing of people entering a workplace? <EOS>
Coronavirus isn’t just infecting young people. It’s killing young, healthy people as well. 
We’ve reported many stories about young people getting severely sick with or dying from coronavirus.
Dimitri Mitchell, 18, admits he had a “false sense of security.” But he was later hospitalized with coronavirus and now wants everyone to take it seriously. 
“I just want to make sure everybody knows that no matter what their age is, it can seriously affect them. And it can seriously mess them up, like it messed me up,” the Iowa teen said. 
He started feeling sick with just a small cough. “I thought at first it was just a normal cold. And then it started progressively getting worse,” he said. 
“Four days in, the really bad symptoms started coming along. I started having really bad outbreaks, like sweating, and my eyes were really watery. I was getting warmer and warmer, and I was super fatigued. … I would start experiencing the worst headaches I’ve ever felt in my life. They were absolutely horrible.”
Eventually, the teen had to be hospitalized. His mother said she worried he might “fall asleep and never wake up.” 
Mitchell is now recovering, but has suffered from long-term effects. 
“I just hope everybody’s responsible, because it’s nothing to joke about,” he said. “It’s a real problem, and I want everybody to make sure they’re following social distancing guidelines and the group limits. And just listen to all the rules and precautions and stay up to date with the news and make sure they’re informed.” <SEP> My teenagers aren’t taking this seriously. Any advice? <EOS>

People with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have had a wide range of illnesses reported – ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness and death.
These symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus:

Fever or chills
Cough
Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
Fatigue
Muscle or body aches
Headache
New loss of taste or smell
Sore throat
Congestion or runny nose
Nausea or vomiting
Diarrhea

In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure, and even death.
If you are sick with COVID-19 or think you might have COVID-19, do not leave your home, except to get medical care, and do not visit public areas. Those experiencing these symptoms should call their doctor or healthcare provider about how to proceed. For more guidance, visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website.

The CDC recently changed its guidance on wearing face masks as more studies about asymptomatic spread pile up.
Now, the CDC “recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies).”
But there are several important caveats and key points: 

The public should NOT buy surgical masks or N95 respirator masks. Those are desperately needed by health care workers who are in close contact with coronavirus patients every day. 
Instead, make your own cloth mask — it’s easy, and you don’t have to sew. US Surgeon General Jerome Adams shows how to make face masks with just a T-shirt and rubber bands in this CDC video. You can also use a bandana and a coffee filter. 
You can definitely still get coronavirus even if you wear a mask. The virus can stay alive on surfaces for up to 3 days, and it’s easy to touch your face whenever you’re not wearing a mask. Also, people often adjust face masks frequently, leading to more touching of the face — a common way that coronavirus spreads.
It’s important to wash your cloth mask after every use. Here’s how. 
Wearing cloth masks is just “an additional, voluntary public health measure,” the CDC said. To protect yourself from getting coronavirus, it’s critical to stay 6 feet away from others, wash your hands frequently for at least 20 seconds each time, and stop touching your face. <SEP> Should I wear a face mask in public? If so, how do I make one? <EOS>

Yes. CDC recommends that people wear cloth face coverings in public settings and when around people who don’t live in their household, especially when other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain. CDC recommends that organizers require staff to wear cloth face coverings and encourage attendees ahead of events to bring and wear cloth face coverings at the event. Cloth face coverings are most essential when physical distancing is difficult (such as when moving within a crowd or audience). Cloth face coverings are meant to protect other people in case the wearer is unknowingly infected but does not have symptoms. Cloth face coverings are not surgical masks or respirators. They are not personal protective equipment.
Cloth face coverings are strongly encouraged in settings where individuals might raise their voices (such as shouting, chanting, singing). Provide all staff with information on proper use, removal, and washing of cloth face coverings. Advise staff that cloth face coverings should not be placed on:

Babies or children younger than 2 years old

Not all patients with COVID-19 require hospital admission (see additional information on implementing appropriate home care below).
The decision to monitor COVID-19 patients in the inpatient or outpatient setting should be made on a case-by-case basis. Patients whose clinical presentation warrants inpatient observation and/or clinical management for supportive care should be hospitalized under appropriate isolation precautions.  Conversely, the decision to manage the patient as an outpatient will depend on the clinical presentation, the patient’s ability to engage in monitoring, the ability for safe isolation at home, and the risk of transmission in the patient’s home environment. All decisions regarding the movement of people being tested for COVID-19 must be made in conjunction with the local health department. <SEP> Do patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 need to be admitted to the hospital? <EOS>

 Yes. On April 28, 2020, FDA issued an umbrella Emergency Use Authorization for SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Tests (Lateral flow or Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests) that have been evaluated in an independent validation study performed at the National Institutes of Health's (NIH) National Cancer Institute (NCI), or by another government agency designated by FDA, and are confirmed by FDA to meet the criteria set forth in the Scope of Authorization (Section II) in the Letter of Authorization. Under this EUA, authorized devices are intended for use as an aid in identifying individuals with an adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2, indicating recent or prior infection, by detecting antibodies (IgG, or IgG and IgM, or total), as specified in each authorized device's instructions for use, to SARS-CoV-2 in human plasma and/or serum. Emergency use of devices authorized under the umbrella EUA is limited to laboratories certified under CLIA to perform moderate or high complexity tests.
FDA will inform developers of their tests' potential eligibility for inclusion in the umbrella EUA when sharing the results of the testing with developers. The developer may request that their test be added to Appendix A of the umbrella EUA upon submission of the information set forth in the Scope of Authorization (Section II) of the EUA to CDRH-EUA-Templates@fda.hhs.gov. In order to streamline the submission and review process, FDA recommends manufacturers use the Serology Template for Commercial Manufacturers to submit the information described in the Scope of Authorization (Section II) of the EUA. FDA will issue a letter to developers notifying them of their addition to Appendix A of the umbrella EUA after confirmation that the applicable performance and labeling criteria set forth in the Scope of Authorization (Section II) of the EUA have been met.
If the test is not eligible for inclusion in the umbrella EUA, for example because the test is for use only in laboratories certified by CLIA to perform high complexity tests or the manufacturer has additional validation data, and intends to seek authorization for specimen types in addition to plasma and serum, manufacturers can still use the data in support of an individual EUA request. <SEP>  If I send my tests to NCI for evaluation, can I use the data they collect to support an EUA request?

That’s “not a great idea,” said Dr. Joseph Vinetz, a professor of infectious diseases at Yale School of Medicine. “We have no evidence about that.” 
“If there’s a metal piece in an N95 or surgical mask and even staples, you can’t microwave them,” he said. “It’ll blow up.”
Vinetz said cloth masks can be washed and reused, and even disposable masks can be reused if you let them sit for several days. 
To disinfect masks that you can’t wash, Vinetz recommends leaving them in a clean, safe place in your home for a few days. After that, it should no longer be infectious, as this coronavirus is known to survive on hard surfaces for only up to three days. <SEP> Can I disinfect my mask by putting it in the microwave? <EOS>

You can play team sport in any number if this is formally organised by a sports club or similar organisation and sports-governing body guidance has been issued. You should only be playing team sports where the relevant governing body has published guidance on how to do so safely. For example, the English Cricket Board has published guidance here and the FA has published guidance here. If you are playing one of these sports informally, such as in the park or a private garden, there must be no more than 30 people involved (including participants, coaches, umpires, spectators).
Team sports that do not have approved guidance should not be played if you cannot socially distance from people you do not live with. Instead, people should train together and take part in activities such as conditioning or fitness sessions in groups of no more than six people (outdoors) or two households (in any setting).

Coronavirus can live on some surfaces for a little while, but we are still learning
               about this. When kids get home:

They should wash their hands when they come into the house. This is one of the
               most important things to do.
They should take off their shoes and leave them by the door. You might also have
               kids change into clean clothes.

Current evidence, though still preliminary, suggests that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, may remain viable for hours to days on surfaces made from a variety of materials. It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
If the machinery or equipment in question are not accessible to employees or have not been in contact with someone infected with COVID-19, they will not present an exposure hazard.
If machinery or equipment are thought to be contaminated and can be cleaned, follow the CDC cleaning and disinfection recommendations. First, clean dirty surfaces with soap and water. Second, disinfect surfaces using products that meet EPA’s criteria for use against SARS-Cov-2external icon and are appropriate for the surface.
If machinery or equipment are thought to be contaminated and cannot be cleaned, they can be isolated. Isolate papers or any soft (porous) surfaces for a minimum of 24 hours before handling. After 24 hours, remove soft materials from the area and clean the hard (non-porous) surfaces per the cleaning and disinfection recommendations. Isolate hard (non-porous) surfaces that cannot be cleaned and disinfected for a minimum of 7 days before handling. <SEP> How do I clean and disinfect machinery or equipment? <EOS>
Yes. To keep patients and healthcare personnel (HCP) healthy and safe, CDC’s infection prevention and control guidance applies to all settings where healthcare is delivered. However, as with any guidance, facilities can tailor certain recommendations to their setting. For example, inpatient psychiatric care includes communal experiences and group activities that may need to continue. If so, these activities might need to be adapted to align with social distancing recommendations. Other recommended infection control measures (for example, ensuring access to alcohol-based hand sanitizer, cohorting patients with COVID-19 and assigning dedicated staff, or implementing universal source control measures) might not be safe or appropriate to implement in all locations or for all patients due to security and behavioral concerns.
Challenges and potential solutions specific to behavioral health settings might include:

Cohorting

Challenge: To prevent transmission, it is generally recommended that patients with COVID-19 be transferred to a separate area of the facility where they can be cared for by dedicated HCP. Because of security concerns or specialized care needs, it might not be possible to cohort certain patients together or change HCP assigned to their care.
Potential Solutions: When cohorting is not possible, implement measures to maintain social distancing (at least 6 feet) between patients with COVID-19 and others on the unit. Ideally, this would include a separate bathroom for COVID-19 patients. Ensure HCP wear all recommended personal protective equipment (PPE) when caring for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.

Challenge: Group counseling, therapy, and discussion sessions are a critical component of psychiatric treatment and care plans, but the traditional set-up for these activities is not compatible with social distancing recommendations.
Potential Solutions: When possible, use virtual methods, or decrease group size so social distancing can be maintained. In the event that COVID-19 is transmitted in the facility, sessions should stop or move to a video discussion forum until additional infection prevention measures are in place to stop the spread.


Cloth Face Coverings

Challenge: For some patients, the use of cloth face coverings or facemasks might pose an additional danger or may cause distress. Some patients may be unable or unwilling to use them as intended. Elastic and cloth straps can be used for strangling oneself or others, and metal nasal bridges can be used for self-harm or as a weapon.
Potential Solutions: Consider allowing patients at low risk for misuse to wear cloth face coverings or facemasks, with a preference for those with short ear-loops rather than longer ties. Consider use of cloth face coverings or facemasks during supervised group activities. Ensure that HCP interacting with patients who cannot wear a cloth face covering or facemask are wearing eye protection and a facemask (or a respirator if the patient is suspected to have COVID-19 and respirators are available).


Alcohol-based Hand Sanitizer

Challenge: While alcohol-based hand sanitizer (ABHS) containing 60-95% alcohol is an important tool to increase adherence to hand hygiene recommendations, ABHS must be used carefully in psychiatric facilities to ensure it is not ingested by patients.
Potential Solutions: Consider not placing ABHS in patients’ rooms in psychiatric facilities, nor in locations where the patients have unsupervised access. Encourage frequent hand washing with soap and water for patients and HCP. Consider providing personal, pocket-sized ABHS dispensers for HCP.


Dining

Challenge: As part of social distancing, communal dining is generally not recommended. However, eating needs to remain supervised due to the potential for self-harm with eating utensils and because commonly used psychiatric medications may cause side effects (e.g., tardive dyskinesia, dysphagia, hypo- and hypersalivation) that increase choking risk for patients.
Potential Solutions: One option is to position staff in patients’ rooms to monitor their dining. Another option is to allow communal dining in shifts so that staff can monitor patients while ensuring they remain at least 6 feet apart. A third option is to have patients sit in appropriately spaced chairs in the hallway outside their rooms so they can be monitored while they eat.


Smoking

Challenge: A higher proportion of psychiatric patients smoke cigarettes compared to the general population. Patients might congregate in outdoor smoking spaces without practicing appropriate social distancing.
Potential Solutions: Limit the number of patients allowed to access smoking spaces at the same time, and position staff to observe and ensure patients are practicing appropriate physical distancing. <SEP> Do CDC’s interim infection prevention and control recommendations for COVID-19 apply to psychiatric hospitals or other behavioral health facilities? <EOS>
Illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for children and young adults. However, it can cause serious illness: about 1 in every 5 people who catch it need hospital care. It is therefore quite normal for people to worry about how the COVID-19 outbreak will affect them and their loved ones.
We can channel our concerns into actions to protect ourselves, our loved ones and our communities. First and foremost, among these actions is regular and thorough hand-washing and good respiratory hygiene. Secondly, keep informed and follow the advice of the local health authorities including any restrictions put in place on travel, movement and gatherings. <SEP> Should I worry about COVID-19? <EOS>
The primary role of cloth face coverings are to reduce the release of infectious particles into the air when someone speaks, coughs, or sneezes, including someone who has COVID-19 but may not show symptoms. Cloth face coverings are not a substitute for washing hands, physical distancing while performing essential activities, and staying home, but they may be helpful when combined with these actions. <SEP> How effectively do cloth face coverings prevent the spread of COVID-19? <EOS>
A coronavirus emergency relief package, passed by Congress in mid-March, gives qualified workers two weeks of paid sick leave if they are ill, quarantined or seeking a diagnosis or preventive care for the coronavirus, or if they are caring for sick family members. It gives 12 weeks of paid leave to people caring for children whose schools are closed or whose child care provider is unavailable because of the coronavirus.
Many workers at small and midsize companies and nonprofits can get the paid leave, as can government employees, as long as they’ve been employed at least 30 days. The law includes people who don’t typically get such benefits, like part-time and gig-economy workers. But it excludes those at companies with more than 500 people, including many front-line employees at many major retailers and fast-food restaurants.
Workers at places with fewer than 50 employees are included, but the Labor Department could exempt small businesses if providing leave would put them out of business. Employers can also decline to give leave to workers on the front lines of the crisis: health care providers and emergency responders. <SEP> What about sick leave? <EOS>
 Land exchange projects will continue and may experience delays associated as the agency transitions to virtual delivery of mission work. <SEP>  Will land exchange projects continue? <EOS>
There is currently no known risk associated with being in the same room at a funeral or visitation service with the body of someone who died of COVID-19.
Anyone who is sick should stay home. These actions help prevent people from getting sick and help stop the spread of the virus.
Also, tribal leaders can help. While each tribe has its own traditions regarding death rituals and funerals (including family feeds, giveaways, and commemorative gatherings), it is important for leaders to determine ways for immediate family members to take part while making sure that

Vulnerable populations are protected.
Everyone practices frequent hand washing (hand hygiene) and social distancing (keep 6 feet of space or greater between people).
Gatherings are limited to 10 or fewer people.

CDC recommends wearing masks in public settings where social distancing is difficult to maintain (for example, at grocery stores and pharmacies). This is especially important in communities where COVID-19 is spreading. So, if you do go to a funeral or gathering, use a mask. But also try to keep about 6 feet from others who are present. You can find more information about using a mask.
Do not place masks on young children under age 2. Also, don’t place a mask on anyone who has trouble breathing or who is unconscious or unable to remove the mask without assistance. <SEP> Am I at risk if I go to a family gathering, traditional event, ceremony, or funeral for someone who died of COVID-19? <EOS>
It is important to assure continuous access to essential HIV prevention, testing and treatment services also where measurements of confinement are implemented within the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic. While access to essential services should be maintained, adapted and evidence-based measures to reduce possible transmission should be considered and implemented.  These include[12]: Applying standard precautions for all patients (including ensuring that all patients cover their nose and mouth with a tissue or elbow when coughing or sneezing, offering a medical mask to patients with suspected COVID-19 infection while they are in waiting in the service, perform hand hygiene etc.) Health care and outreach      workers, as well as peer educators and clients should apply adapted hand      hygiene measuresEnsuring triage, early      recognition, and source control (isolating patients with suspected      COVID-19 infection)Ensure there is adequate      ventilation in all areas in the healthcare facilitySpatial separation of at least      1 metre should ideally be maintained between all patients within all types      of servicesCleaning and disinfection      procedures should be followed consistently and correctlyDispensing medicines (for treatment of HIV, TB and      other chronic conditions such as opioid dependence) for longer periods      allowing reduced frequency of patient visits Consider reduction of services to the most critical      ones (provision of essential treatment and prevention services; services      such as counselling sessions may be reduced or adapted)Generally, vulnerable populations, including members of key populations, as well as homeless and/or displaced people may be at increased risk of infection – because of additional comorbidities impacting on their immune system, reduced ability to apply measures of confinement and social distancing, as well as generally limited access to health services.  It is critical that services that reach these populations such as community-based services, drop-in centres and outreach services can continue providing life-saving prevention (distribution of condoms, needles and syringes), testing and treatment while securing safety of staff and clients. Services can be adapted according to above considerations where applicable. <SEP> How can programmes assure continued access to HIV services? <EOS>

During respirator shortages, care should be taken to ensure that N95 respirators are reserved for situations where respiratory protection is most important, such as performance of aerosol-generating procedures on patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection. In such shortage situations, facemasks might be used for other types of patient care.
Alternatives to N95 respirators might be considered where feasible. These include other classes of NIOSH-approved filtering facepiece respirators, half facepiece or full facepiece elastomeric respirators, and powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) where feasible. All of these alternatives will provide equivalent or higher protection than N95 respirators when properly worn. However, PAPRs and elastomeric respirators should not be used in surgical settings due to concerns that exhaled air may contaminate the sterile field. For more information please see: Strategies for Optimizing the Supply of N95 Respirators: Conventional Capacity Strategies.
When respirator supplies are restored, the facility can switch back to use of N95 respirators for all care of patients with known or suspected COVID-19 infection. For more information, please see Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings. <SEP> How should the use of N95 respirators be prioritized within obstetric healthcare settings during shortages? <EOS>
The American Academy of Pediatrics reminds parents that staying home and social distancing are still most effective in preventing the spread of the virus, but it offers advice about helping children get accustomed to masks. They are not recommended for those under 2, and there may be some children who can’t wear them — the A.A.P. mentions those with “severe cognitive or respiratory impairments.” On the other hand, immunocompromised children might need more protection than cloth face coverings offer, and N95 masks are recommended.
The A.A.P.’s suggestions include putting a cloth face covering on a child’s favorite stuffed animal, decorating masks so they’re more personalized and drawing a mask on your child’s favorite book character. <SEP> How can I help my child get accustomed to wearing a mask during school? <EOS>
Taxis and ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft remain in operation.

Federal Student Loans
To provide relief to student loan borrowers during the COVID-19 national emergency, under the CARES ACT, federal student loan borrowers are automatically being placed in an administrative forbearance, which allows you to temporarily stop making your monthly loan payment.
Your payments will automatically stop from March 13, 2020, through Sept. 30, 2020. This suspension of payments will last until Sept. 30, 2020, but you can still make payments if you choose.
To determine if your loans are eligible, contact your loan servicer online or by phone. Your servicer is the entity to which you make your monthly payment. If you do not know who your servicer is or how to contact them, visit StudentAid.gov/login or call 1-800-4-FED-AID (1-800-433-3243; TTY for the deaf or hearing-impaired 1-800-730-8913) for assistance.

State Financial Aid Programs
NOTE: The deadline to apply for renewal of state tuition aid for the 2020-2021 academic year passed on June 1.
New legislation directs the Higher Education Student Assistance Authority (HESAA) to exclude the Spring 2020 semester from a student's total lifetime eligibility limits for all state financial aid programs if a student is unable to finish the semester due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
Additionally, students who withdrew or reduced credits during this time will not have to repay the state financial aid amounts that the student would have had to return under previous law.
The eligibility criteria for the New Jersey Student Tuition Assistance Reward Scholarship (NJ STARS) Program and the New Jersey Student Tuition Assistance Reward Scholarship II (NJ STARS II) Program will also be temporarily relaxed to allow students to remain eligible even if their Spring 2020 grade point average fell below the previous eligibility minimums.
As New Jersey students and families face the challenges of responding to the Coronavirus pandemic and its impact on the economy, is committed to helping borrowers with loans through the New Jersey College Loans to Assist State Students (NJCLASS) program.
Due to the current crisis, NJCLASS borrowers may be experiencing unemployment, illness, or other changes that have reduced their earnings. HESAA offers several repayment relief options to borrowers in circumstances that have interrupted their ability to make payments on NJCLASS loans.
There is no fee to apply for any of the relief options, and HESAA has never charged borrowers late fees. During this public health emergency, HESAA has also suspended the use of wage garnishments and withholding of state income tax refunds to collect on past due loans.
For more information about HESAA's relief programs and how to apply, HESAA has created a reference guide.
Private Student Loans
The State has secured relief options with private student loan servicers to expand on the protections the federal government granted to federal student loan borrowers. These new options stand to benefit an estimated 200,000 New Jerseyans with privately held student loans.
New Jersey residents with commercially-owned Federal Family Education Program Loans or privately held student loans who are struggling to make their payments due to the COVID-19 pandemic will be eligible for expanded relief.
Borrowers in need of assistance must immediately contact their student loan servicer to identify the options that are appropriate to their circumstances. Relief options offered by participating servicers include:

Providing a minimum of 90 days of forbearance relief for borrowers;
Waiving late payment fees for borrowers;
Ensuring no borrower is subject to negative credit reporting;
Ceasing debt collection lawsuits for 90 days; and
Working with eligible borrowers to enroll them in other applicable borrower assistance programs.

This is an initiative that servicers have opted into. Borrowers should contact their servicers to utilize the relief options.
Residents who have questions or are experiencing trouble with their student loan servicer may contact the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance Consumer Hotline at 1-800-446-7467 or file a complaint online.

Operation LASER was declared a Special Duty Operation in CANFORGEN 073/20, released on 27 May 20. This CANFORGEN announced that on 26 May 2020 the Minister of National Defence, in consultation with the Minister of Veterans Affairs Canada, designated Operation LASER as a Special Duty Operation (SDO) to ensure that CAF members have the timeliest access to disability and pension programs under the Veterans Well-being Act. The declaration of an SDO for Op LASER is retroactive to 03 April 20 and will remain in effect until further notice. This designation ensures that all personnel specifically assigned to Op LASER will be able to access benefits relating to any injury or illness sustained, or that has its onset, during their service on Op LASER, any training related to their deployment, any leave, or during final return to their home units.
Compensation and Benefits Instruction (CBI) 205.38 – Exceptional Hazard Allowance, has been amended to compensate Canadian Armed Forces members who are deployed in COVID-19 risk environments. Eligible Canadian Armed Forces members deployed on Operation LASER for service at a Long-Term Care Facility, and members deployed on Op GLOBE deemed to have been exposed to specific COVID-19 threat levels, will receive the allowance.

Worker Limit: All businesses must limit the number of workers inside their facility to 1 worker per 250
    gross square feet of facility space (this means total space, including areas open only to staff like storage rooms).
     To determine how many workers you may have inside at one time, calculate the total square footage of your
    facility and divide it by 250. There are some limited exceptions to the density limitations in the Order and
    directives.
Customer Limit: All businesses must also limit the number of customers/members of the public to 1 person per
    150 square feet of total indoor space open to the public (this means the sales/retail floor, rooms where individual
    customer services are provided, restrooms, elevators, and other public accessible areas, but not areas open only to
    staff).  To determine how many customers/members of the public you may allow inside your facility at one time,
    calculate the total square footage of your facility that is open to the public and divide it by 150.

Example: If you run a retail store that is 1,900 gross square feet, with 1,600 square feet of
        customer-serving space, you may have no more than 7 employees and 10 customers in the store at any time. <SEP> The local Health Officer Order requires that I limit the number of people inside my business facility.

If you think you have been exposed to COVID-19, but you don’t have symptoms, follow the instructions on how to quarantine for 14 days after exposure. You may also want to get tested, but wait at least seven days after the date you think you were exposed to get tested using a PCR test.
	If you get tested too early, there may not be enough viral material for the test to detect.
While it’s a good idea to wait about seven days to be tested after the date of exposure if you don’t have symptoms, some people may not become ill for up to 14 days. For that reason, people who have been exposed to COVID-19 should minimize their contact with others for 14 days from the date of their exposure, even if they test negative before the full two weeks have passed. <SEP> I think I have been exposed to COVID-19, but I’m not showing symptoms - what should I do? <EOS>

You are going to have to work together to weigh each other’s needs. One partner might have parents who are older and at higher risk of complications from the coronavirus; the other might be an extrovert who thrives on being around other people and is, emotionally, at a breaking point.
Remember that you’re on the same team. “It’s not, ‘My needs versus your needs, and let’s negotiate,’ but asking the question and having the posture of: ‘What is best for our relationship?’” said Jennifer Bullock, a psychotherapist based in Philadelphia.
Several psychologists and counselors recommended presenting a united front when explaining shared decisions to friends and family. Any sort of “I would, but he’s afraid” seeds resentment and can amplify the problem far past the boundaries of your own home.
In any fraught situation, sit down with your partner and listen. Instead of offering rebuttals, try to treat it more like an interview about where he or she is coming from. Ask open-ended questions — which can’t be answered with a simple “yes” or “no.” You could try: “How should we approach our safety when I go back to the office?”
But remember, this is a pandemic. If one person is seriously scared about their health or the health of their family, their needs might take priority. Ultimately, your well-being and others’ should take precedence. <SEP> My partner wants to go out more than I do. What should we do? <EOS>

People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are living in or visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading. Some people are worried about the disease. Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, towards Chinese or other Asian Americans or people who were in quarantine.
Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a nation. Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths.
Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger towards ordinary people instead of the disease that is causing the problem.

There is no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19. Studies are currently ongoing to determine the efficacy of different antiviral treatments. People with COVID-19 can seek medical care to help relieve symptoms. <SEP> Is there a treatment? <EOS>
Based on what we currently know, transmission of COVID-19 is primarily occurring from people when they have symptoms, and can also occur just before they develop symptoms, when they are in close proximity to others for prolonged periods of time. While someone who never develops symptoms can also pass the virus to others, it is still not clear to what extent this occurs and more research is needed in this area. Limiting contact with people who are infected with COVID-19, frequent, thorough, hand cleansing and wearing a mask when at least 1 metre of physical distance can’t be guaranteed, help to break chains of transmission. <SEP> When can infected people transmit the virus? <EOS>
 The USDA Forest Service has not issued agency-wide direction to pause all prescribed burning activity. The USDA Forest Service is taking a risk-informed approach to managing prescribed fire by evaluating the following factors: (1) the ability to maintain fire responder viability and sustainability; (2) potential smoke impacts to communities from prescribed fire and how that interacts with COVID-19 effects; and (3) the ability to use local resources so inter-state travel is not necessary. We will continue to adapt as the situation evolves and work in coordination with local and state health organizations. <SEP>  Has the USDA Forest Service paused its prescribed burning program in response to COVID-19 risks? <EOS>
Because newborns' immune systems are still
               developing, they have a harder time fighting illnesses. So it's important to stay
               away from other people when your baby comes home from the hospital.
To protect your baby:

Keep your baby at home and away from others as much as possible. Don't have friends
               and family over to meet the baby, and don't take the baby to other people's homes.
If you have to take your baby out — for instance, to a doctor's visit —
               keep yourself and your baby at least 6 feet away from other people. You should
               wear a mask or cloth face covering, but do not put anything over your baby's
               face.
If someone in your home is sick, take all recommended precautions. Keep your baby
               away from anyone who is sick.
At home, all caregivers should wash their hands before and after touching your
               baby. Keep all surfaces clean. <SEP> Is it OK to Let Visitors Meet My New Baby at Home? <EOS>
 Pursuant to Executive Order  202.16, there is out-of-state reciprocity for clinical laboratory personnel  (who may or may not be licensed) to the extent necessary to permit individuals  to perform testing for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, or its antibodies, in  specimens collected from individuals suspected of suffering from a COVID-19  infection, as long as the individuals performing this testing meet the federal requirements for testing personnel appropriate  to the assay or device authorized by the FDA or the New York State Department  of Health. <SEP> Can clinical laboratory personnel from outside of New York State perform  testing for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, or its antibodies, in specimens  collected from individuals suspected of suffering from a COVID-19 infection if  they meet the federal requirements for testing personnel? <EOS>
After returning to work, healthcare providers should:

Wear a facemask for source control at all times while in the healthcare facility until all symptoms are completely resolved or at baseline. A facemask instead of a cloth face covering should be used by these HCPs for source control during this time period while in the facility. After this time period, these HCPs should revert to their facility policy regarding universal source controlduring the pandemic.

A facemask for source control does not replace the need to wear an N95 or higher-level respirator (as well as other recommended PPE) when indicated, including when caring for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.
Of note, respirators with an exhaust valve might not provide source control.


Self-monitor for symptoms, and seek re-evaluation from occupational health if respiratory symptoms recur or worsen.

UPDATE: Rhode Island was the first state to mandate guidelines that require staff to count the number of customers entering and exiting the store in order to keep occupancy below 20% of state fire capacity, and to clearly mark 6-foot spaces in lines and other high-traffic areas. The Connecticut Food Association has published “Safe Stores Guidelines” that recommend occupancy capped at 50% of store capacity. Where possible, grocery stores may consider closing their doors to customers and switching to curbside pickup. While public officials have not yet required such steps, in recent days the US Labor Department and the California Department of Industrial Relations recommended that companies switch to curb-side pickup.

There is still a general shortage of masks, and medical-grade N95 masks are being reserved for health care workers. If you are able to source a large number of cloth or paper masks to offer your city’s residents, give priority to workers at essential businesses, those in crowded living situations (such as shelters), those taking public transportation, and others in high-risk communities. You can also help direct residents to the CDC’s guidelines for constructing homemade face coverings.
Mayors might also want to encourage virtual “sewing circles” in their communities to increase the supply of home-made masks for people who can’t make their own. This would give some people in the community a way to constructively contribute to fighting the virus, and also has the benefit of helping to reserve N95 and surgical masks for the people with greatest exposure – healthcare workers, public safety workers, and essential service providers. (Dutch Leonard, 4/21/20) <SEP> What can we do to get cloth or paper masks to all residents? <EOS>
You should follow your state and/or local jurisdictional guidance regarding continuing operations at your facility. There have not been any reports of horses testing positive for the virus that causes COVID-19. Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading the virus that causes COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. COVID-19 is primarily spread from person to person, so steps should be taken to reduce the risks for people visiting your facility.

Encourage employees and other visitors, including boarders, owners, farriers, veterinarians, and those taking lessons, not to enter the facility if they are sick. Employees should not return to work until the criteria to discontinue home isolation are met, after talking with their doctor. Implement sick leave policies that are flexible, nonpunitive, and consistent with public health guidance, allowing employees to stay home if they have symptoms of respiratory infection.
Consider conducting daily health checks (e.g., symptom and/or temperature screening) of employees and others visiting the facility before they enter the premises. People with a fever of 100.40(38.00C) or above or other signs of illness should not be admitted to the premises. If implementing health checks, conduct them safely and respectfully. See General Business FAQs for more information.

Employees or visitors who appear to have symptoms upon arrival or who become sick during their visit should immediately be separated from other employees and visitors and sent home.


Limit the number of people entering the facility. Consider staggering lesson and visiting times to limit the number of people in the facility and potential for person-to-person contact. If possible, you can also take steps to decrease high-traffic areas by limiting areas open to visitors/owners or staggering use of common areas like grooming or wash stalls and tack rooms.
Increase distance and limit duration of contact between employees and visitors in the facility. Whenever possible, people should maintain at least 6 feet of distance between each other at the facility, including instructors teaching lessons. Allow for social distancing and avoid large numbers of people within the facility, including in employee-only areas.
Visitors and employees should wear masks to protect others especially where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain. Wearing a mask does NOT replace the need to practice social distancing.
Set up hand hygiene stations at the entrance and within the facility, so that employees and people entering can clean their hands before they enter. Employees should wash hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. An alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol can be used, but if hands are visibly dirty, they should be washed with soap and water before using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Examples of hand hygiene stations may be a hose and soap located at entrances to allow for handwashing before entry.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as grooming tools, halters, lead ropes, shared tack and equipment, and door handles/gates (including those to stall doors and pasture/turn out areas) on a routine basis. To disinfect, use products that meet EPA’s criteria for use against theexternal icon virus that causes COVID-19 and are appropriate for the surface, diluted household bleach solutions prepared according to the manufacturer’s label for disinfection, or alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol. Follow manufacturer’s directions for use, especially regarding product contact time and protections from chemical hazards posed by cleaners and disinfectants.
Follow local guidance on shelter in place and travel recommendations when traveling for showing, training, or trail riding.
If traveling to a new facility, limit contact between people, horses, tack, equipment, and other supplies from different facilities, and maintain a distance of at least 6 feet between horses and riders.

Follow state and local guidance on travel. People who are sick should not travel to other facilities.
People visiting other facilities should follow the same precautions as they would normally, including maintaining at least 6 feet of distance between each other, wearing a mask to protect others, and washing hands frequently with soap and water.


If other animals, such as barn cats, are present at the facility, be aware that a small number of pets have been reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after contact with people with COVID-19.

Remdesivir is an antiviral treatment that had a positive result in one randomized controlled study, showing that it could cut the number of days in the hospital. The research is ongoing. You have to examine where in the process it’s given—it was being given quite late to very sick patients. There are other studies taking place using it earlier in the timeline to see if it could be more effective then. 
The studies on immunity are moving ahead, and there remains a fair amount of hope for the convalescent serum and other types of antibody products to provide some protection. It'll be about two months before we get results. Recent evidence has indicated that most people tend to make antibodies, which is good. We also know that there are antibodies that really do neutralize the virus. The most promising short-term treatment option could be antibody-type therapies, and perhaps in summer we'll get evidence that they provide some benefit. That could really help slow the spread, even if it's not available to everyone. Preventive antibody treatment could help safeguard first responders and healthcare workers or nursing home residents and staff. 
We’re still using social distancing to buy time for science to come to the rescue. There are many different scientists working on this challenge and so many different ways to approach it. We don't need everything to work. We just need a few things to work. We're in the difficult time before we get that breakthrough, and we're just trying to buy time for progress.

Yes. The Health Officer’s Order makes no changes to ADA requirements, and the ADA remains in full force countywide.
    Businesses and public entities must comply with their usual ADA obligations, even if they are making changes to
    their facilities to implement their Social Distancing Protocols. For example, if a business chooses to rearrange
    furniture in its facility to make it easier for customers to practice social distancing, the new furniture
    arrangement must follow ADA requirements for ingress and egress. Similarly, if a restaurant decides to open outdoor
    dining, it may not position its outdoor tables and chairs so that they block or intrude on the public right of way.

We did hear from Governor Cuomo that an investigation in New York revealed that a substantial fraction of new infections came from inside homes. Unfortunately, we don't have details about how those people became infected, a critical piece of data. 
To limit transmission inside the home, we recommend that people isolating at home have a dedicated room and ideally a dedicated bathroom. For communities that can manage it, it might be helpful to have a dedicated space, like a hotel, where people who don’t have space to isolate safely or who live with vulnerable people can recover away from their homes and not risk infecting others there.

Outpatient providers are strongly advised to set up triage mechanisms to identify patients who might be at-risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2.  Current CDC infection control guidance states that people who meet PUI criteria should only be evaluated in a facility that can employ the recommended precautions, including employees who are fit-tested for N95 respirators. If that is not possible in your setting, then the patient needs to be transported to a facility that can. If you already have a system in place to transfer a patient to another facility, use that system. <SEP> What should outpatient providers do to protect themselves if they are not fit-tested for an N95 respirator? <EOS>
As of June 21, New Jersey's nursing homes, Assisted Living residences, dementia care homes, pediatric transitional care homes, and comprehensive personal care homes, can welcome reunions with loved ones in a designated outdoor space.
Individuals should check with long-term care facilities for specific visitor policies. The Department of Health has issued a Directive with measures that must be in place to reduce risks, including:

A resident who is suspected or confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 or quarantined for a COVID-19 exposure cannot have visitors. A resident who has tested positive is allowed visitation after they have met the criteria for discontinuation of isolation.
There will only be two visitors permitted at a time and the visitors must remain at least 6 feet away from the resident. Both visitors and residents must wear face coverings.
A staff member, wearing a surgical mask, must remain with the resident during the visit.
A designated area should be established for visitors to be screened that maintains social distancing and infection control standards. If the individual has any COVID-19 symptoms, they will not be permitted to visit with a resident.
Visitors are not allowed beyond the reception area of the facilities and restrooms will not be available to them.
When staff are transporting the resident outdoors, they cannot be moved through any space where either positive or suspected COVID patients are cohorted. A safe distance of 6 feet distance must be maintained between other residents and staff.
Long-term care facilities should communicate the visitor policy to residents, families, staff and others. They should receive informed consent from the resident and the visitor in writing that they are aware of the possible dangers of COVID-19 exposure and that they will comply with the facility's policies during the visit. As part of the consent form, the visitor must agree to notify the facility if they test positive for the virus or have symptoms within 14 days of visiting.

For a full list of safety requirements, refer to the Department of Health Executive Directive 20-017.
End-Of-Life Visitation
During end-of-life situations, healthy visitors are permitted within long-term care facilities, assisted living residences, dementia care homes, pediatric transitional care homes, and comprehensive personal care homes.
Healthy is defined as individuals with no signs of respiratory illness such as fever, cough or shortness of breath. They should not have had contact with anyone with or suspected of having COVID-19 or any respiratory illness and individuals should be wearing the appropriate protective equipment.
For a full list of safety requirements refer to Department of Health Executive Guidance 20-017.
If residents or their families need emotional support as a result of difficulties related to the pandemic—such as an extended absence from each other—there are resources available to help.
You can call New Jersey's toll-free hotline and speak with counselors 7 days a week at 1-866-202-HELP (4357).
Visiting Pediatric, Developmentally Disabled, and Intellectually Disabled Residents
In addition to outdoor visits, parents, family, and legal guardians of pediatric, developmentally disabled, and intellectually disabled residents may visit their loved ones indoors at long-term care facilities.
Due to how medically fragile these residents are, visits are by appointment only, health screenings and temperature checks are required, and may only occur at facilities that have had no new probable or confirmed COVID-19 cases in the last 28 days. Visitors must wear face coverings.
For a full list of safety requirements, refer to Department of Health Executive Directive No. 20-025.
REOPENING GUIDANCE FOR LONG-TERM CARE FACILITIES
The Department of Health has issued detailed guidance for the phased reopening of long-term care facilities.
When facilities conclude their outbreaks and implement the requirements of DOH's Executive Directive No. 20-026, they will be able to restore services for residents in phases, culminating in indoor visitation and the restart of normal activities.
The phased-in reopening is based on the outbreak status of a facility, its ability to meet criteria, including, but not limited to, testing of staff and residents, infection control protocols, and adequate staffing and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), and is tied to the timing of the state's reopening plan.
For more information about specific safety protocols and visitation policies, contact a long-term care facility directly. To learn more about the Department of Health's guidance and the phased reopening process, refer to Executive Directive No. 20-026.

Experts are still learning about COVID-19. Far fewer cases have been reported in
               children. Usually, the virus seems to cause a milder infection in children than in

But in some cases of the inflammatory syndrome called MIS-C, kids developed more
               serious symptoms, sometimes several weeks after being infected with the virus. Most
               kids with MIS-C get better after they get special care in the hospital, sometimes

Masks should be used as part of a comprehensive strategy of measures to suppress transmission and save lives; the use of a mask alone is not sufficient to provide an adequate level of protection against COVID-19. You should also maintain a minimum physical distance of at least 1 metre from others, frequently clean your hands and avoid touching your face and mask.Medical masks can protect people wearing the mask from getting infected, as well as can prevent those who have symptoms from spreading them.

A face covering can include a paper or disposable mask, cloth mask, neck gaiter, scarf, bandanna, or a religious face covering. A face covering must cover the mouth and nose completely. The covering should not be overly tight or restrictive and should feel comfortable to wear.
Any masks that incorporate a valve that is designed to facilitate easy exhaling, mesh masks, or masks with openings, holes, visible gaps in the design or material, or vents are not sufficient face coverings because they allow droplets to be released from the mask.

The nurse/staff member may arrange a telephone visit between you and a healthcare provider or tell you to call your provider directly.  The provider can talk with you about possible exposure, your symptoms, and discusses treatment.  The provider may give you self-care advice to use at home.  He or she may tell you to go to your primary care clinic or emergency room/urgent care. <SEP> What happens after I speak to a nurse or office staff member? <EOS>
One of the most important things you can do is reframe and recharacterize this discussion from a political discussion to a community innovation discussion. Keep bringing the focus of your team, and your other constituents, back to the goal – of building the future together – always setting a positive example of the messages and behaviors that you want others to embody as well. 
The current requirement to wear masks in public provides a small example of a leadership opportunity, meaning that with the right leadership—yours—you have an opportunity to emphasize the value of caring about others and to model the behavior that demonstrates that caring.  By modeling a behavior, with the visibility of your position, you make it something that people want to do. Your job is to inspire and tap into intrinsic motivation. The fear of punishment is not as effective as inspiring people’s desire to live up to the community’s values.
Mayors also have a real opportunity to help the public avoid the false dichotomy of caring about the economy versus caring about health. The opportunity is to switch from an “either/or” frame to a “both/and” frame; what we need is new thinking on “how” – how best to enable economic activity without harming people. The practical question for every city is this: How do we navigate the new reality to help people remain healthy while gradually, carefully, and deliberately bringing back aspects of community life? It’s going to be iterative and involve experimentation. It is important to realize that this is a puzzle to be solved, not a decision to be made.  And by solving that puzzle carefully and thoughtfully, making many small changes along the way as you learn more, you will arrive at a good place. This is not something that Mayors can do alone. Solving this puzzle is decidedly a team sport.

Follow guidance for cleaning and disinfecting rooms and areas where a person with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 have visited, including transport vehicles.
Ensure staff or people who are incarcerated wear appropriate PPE when cleaning the facility and handling food service items of people with possible or confirmed COVID-19. Laundry of a person with COVID-19 may be washed with the laundry of other individuals. Individuals handling laundry should wear recommended PPE, should not shake the laundry, and should clean their hands often to prevent spread of COVID . <SEP> What is the best way to clean and disinfect my facility after a confirmed case of COVID-19? <EOS>
Clinicians are able to access laboratory testing through state and local public health laboratories, as well as commercial and clinical laboratories across the country. The Association of Public Health Laboratoriesexternal icon provides a list of states and territories with laboratories that are using COVID-19 viral tests. For more information, see Testing in U.S. Clinicians should direct testing questions to their state health departments. Commercial reference laboratories are also able to offer a larger volume of testing for SARS-CoV-2.
CDC has guidance for who should be tested, but decisions about testing are at the discretion of state and local health departments and/or individual clinicians.
Healthcare providers should report positive  results to their local/state health department CDC does not directly collect these data directly.

COVID-19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe disease. Based on currently available information and clinical expertise, older adults and people with underlying medical conditions are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. <SEP> Who is at higher risk for serious illness from COVID-19? <EOS>
It depends on the severity of your symptoms. If you have mild illness, it is important to stay home and rest. Even those with mild illness could pass the infection to others.
Virginians can now use COVIDCheck, a new online risk-assessment tool to check their symptoms and connect with the appropriate health care resources, including COVID-19 testing.
Call 911 if you have a medical emergency: If you have a medical emergency and need to call 911, notify the dispatch personnel that you have, or are being evaluated for COVID-19. If possible, put on a facemask before emergency medical services arrive.  Emergency warning signs include (but are not limited to): trouble breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, new confusion or inability to arouse a person, or bluish lips or face.
If you are sick with COVID-19, or suspect you are infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, follow the steps below to help prevent the disease from spreading to people in your home and community:

Stay home except to get medical care

Stay home: People who are mildly ill with COVID-19 are able to isolate at home during their illness. You should restrict activities outside your home, except for getting medical care.
Take over- the counter medicines, such as acetaminophen, to make you feel better.
Stay in touch with your doctor. Call before you get medical care. Be sure to get care if you feel worse or you think it is an emergency.
Avoid public areas: Do not go to work, school, or public areas.
Avoid public transportation: Avoid using public transportation, ride-sharing, or taxis.


Separate yourself from other people and animals in your home. This is known as home isolation

Stay away from others: As much as possible, you should stay in a specific “sick room” and away from other people in your home. Also, you should use a separate bathroom, if available.
Limit contact with pets & animals: You should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would around other people. Although there have not been reports of pets or other animals becoming sick with COVID-19, it is still recommended that people sick with COVID-19 limit contact with animals until more information is known about the virus.
When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick. If you are sick with COVID-19, avoid contact with your pet, including petting, snuggling, being kissed or licked, and sharing food. If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets and wear a facemask. See COVID-19 and Animals for more information.


Call ahead before visiting your doctor

Call ahead: If you have a medical appointment, call the healthcare provider and tell them that you have respiratory illness and it is possible you might have COVID-19. This will help the healthcare provider’s office take steps to keep other people from getting infected or exposed.
If you do not have a doctor, your local health department may be able to help connect you with a healthcare provider or free clinic in your area.


Wear a facemask if you are sick

If you are sick: You should wear a facemask when you are around other people (e.g., sharing a room or vehicle) or pets and before you enter a healthcare provider’s office.
If you are caring for others: If the person who is sick is not able to wear a facemask (for example, because it causes trouble breathing), then people who live with the person who is sick should not stay in the same room with them, they should wear a facemask when they enter a room with the person who is sick. Visitors, other than caregivers, are not recommended.


Cover your coughs and sneezes

Cover: Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze.
Dispose: Throw used tissues in a lined trash can.
Wash hands: Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or, if soap and water are not available, clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.


Clean your hands often

Wash hands: Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.
Hand sanitizer: If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, covering all surfaces of your hands and rubbing them together until they feel dry.
Soap and water: Soap and water are the best option if hands are visibly dirty.
Avoid touching: Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.


Avoid sharing personal household items

Do not share: You should not share dishes, drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils, towels, or bedding with other people or pets in your home.
Wash thoroughly after use: After using these items, they should be washed thoroughly with soap and water.


Clean all “high-touch” surfaces every day

Clean and disinfect: Practice routine cleaning of high touch surfaces and your “sick room.” Let someone else clean and disinfect common areas but not your bedroom and bathroom.

High touch surfaces include counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables.


If caregiver or other person needs to clean and disinfect a sick person’s bedroom or bathroom, they should do so on an as-needed basis. The caregiver should wear a mask and wait as long as possible after the person has used the bathroom.
Clean and disinfect areas with bodily fluids: Also, clean any surfaces that may have blood, stool, or body fluids on them.
Household cleaners and disinfectants: Clean the area or item with soap and water or another detergent if it is dirty. Then use a household disinfectant.

Be sure to follow the instructions on the label to ensure safe and effective use of the product. Many products recommend keeping the surface wet for several minutes to ensure germs are killed. Many also recommend precautions such as wearing gloves and making sure you have good ventilation during use of the product.
Most EPA-registered household disinfectants should be effective.




Monitor your symptoms

Seek medical attention: Seek prompt medical attention if your illness is worsening (e.g., difficulty breathing).
Call your doctor: Before going to your doctor’s office or emergency room, call ahead and tell them your symptoms.
Wear a facemask: If possible, put on a facemask before you enter the building. If you cannot put on a facemask, try to keep a safe distance from other people (at least 6 feet away). This will protect the people in the office or the waiting room.
Alert health department: Ask your healthcare provider to call the local health department. Persons who are placed under active monitoring or facilitated self-monitoring should follow instructions provided by their local health department or occupational health professionals, as appropriate.
If you develop emergency warning signs for COVID-19, get medical attention immediately. Emergency warning signs include*:

Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath
Persistent pain or pressure in the chest
New confusion or inability to arouse
Bluish lips or face





* This list is not all-inclusive.  Please consult your healthcare provider for any symptoms that are severe or concerning.
Call 911 if you have a medical emergency: If you have a medical emergency and need to call 911, notify the dispatch personnel that you have, or are being evaluated for COVID-19. If possible, put on a facemask before emergency medical services arrive.

Areas of high concern include homeless shelters as well as jails and prisons. Consider a moratorium on detaining people for low-level crimes or releasing older non-threatening prisoners to reduce the burden and allow more social distancing. For homeless people, work to find them housing or temporary shelter as quickly as possible to decompress shelters. Infection control procedures need to be put in place for these settings—but the best thing is to have as few people as possible in them. (Dr. Josh Sharfstein, 3/19/20)
Young people—teenagers and twenty-somethings—can pose a risk to themselves and others. It’s a myth that they’re not getting sick, and even those who don’t may be carriers.

 Food hasn't been identified as a likely source of COVID-19 spread at this time. However, food safety practices routinely performed at home and work can help reduce the spread of coronavirus and other respiratory viruses in our community. Even if restaurants temporarily close for in-person dining, they may continue filling take-out orders and deliveries. When handling food, use a barrier like tongs, gloves or other utensils to prevent direct hand contact with food.

Travel dramatically increases an individual’s chance of getting infected and infecting others and should be undertaken with caution.
The CDC recommends that travelers postpone all non-essential travel outside of the U.S. Individuals who must travel internationally should be aware that plans are likely to be disrupted by canceled flights, mandatory quarantines and closed borders.
In terms of domestic travel, the CDC recommends you stay home as much as possible and practice social distancing.  Be aware that some communities within the U.S. may require visitors to quarantine for 14 days upon entering a community or when returning home from a trip

Molecular testing, or PCR testing, detects genetic material of the virus and so can detect if a person is currently infected with the COVID-19 virus (SARS-CoV-2).  The full genomic sequence of the virus was shared by Chinese authorities in early January, which enabled many laboratories to develop PCR assays that are now used to detect cases all over the world.  Serological testing detects antibodies against the virus, and so can detect if a person had a recent (IgM) or past (IgG) infection with the COVID-19 virus. Serologic tests cannot be used to diagnose acute infection with the COVID-19 virus. <SEP> What is the difference between molecular testing and serologic testing? <EOS>

We know that balancing work and home responsibilities has become much more difficult during this time and will continue to pose challenges for our Defence Team members. There have been ongoing discussions across DND Senior Management, as well as with TBS and OCHRO to determine the best way forward for the employer and employees in effectively supporting and performing remote work and we will continue to monitor these developments closely.
The phased approach to business resumption requires continuation of the current way of working into the foreseeable future for a significant portion of the workforce.  The Flexible Work program offers guidance and tools to support the use of workplace flexibility. Leave 699 can currently be taken if an individual is experiencing child care challenges. OCHRO will revisit 699 well in advance of September but guidance remains the same for the moment. We expect that employees continue to adopt a good faith approach in using this leave, keeping in mind their important roles in providing services to the Defence Team.

No, you are not required to quarantine when you arrive in Washington. However, if you are traveling from an area where COVID activity is high, the CDC recommends that you quarantine for 14 days. If you’re visiting Washington and do not plan to quarantine, please observe the following precautions for the duration of your stay:

Limit close contact to a small group of people and avoid large crowds.
Maintain a distance of six feet or more from people outside your household.
Wear a mask or face covering in public.
Watch for symptoms and take your temperature once or twice a day. Do not go out if you have symptoms.
Keep a record of the places you go with times and dates. If you get sick, this information is crucial for tracking efforts.

Residents returning to Washington from another state or country should also follow the precautions above for at least 14 days. WA residents must observe requirements for face coverings and gathering size.

Wearing masks depends on the risk assessment. For jobs and tasks that carry a medium or high risk, for people aged 60 and older, and for those with underlying health conditions, a medical mask and other personal protective equipment should be provided. Fabric masks or face coverings are currently recommended for younger people and those with no symptoms where physical distancing is not achievable. This prevents the spread of virus from the wearer (who could have COVID-19 but no symptoms) to others. The policy on wearing a mask or face covering in low risk workplaces should be in line with national or local guidelines. Masks may carry some risks if not used properly. <SEP> Does WHO recommend workers wear masks at the workplace (office or others)? If yes, what type of masks? <EOS>

There is almost certainly no unique indicator for when you should choose to institute a shelter in place. Given the rapid spread of COVID-19 across all corners of the country, now is a crucial time to consider whether you should order residents to stay home. At this point you should assume that COVID-19 is present in your community, whether you have actually seen it yet or not. Many cities and states have enacted shelter-in-place policies but have deemed them to be “stay at home” policies to soften the mandates’ language and make it less frightening to citizens. The New York Times is maintaining an up-to-date map on the states, cities, countries, and territories that have these types of policies. Here are some questions you might want to consider:
How are nearby cases being transmitted? For example, are public health officials able to link cases, or are they originating from unknown persons? The latter would indicate that the virus is spreading widely in the local region and you should strongly consider a shelter in place order.
What are nearby communities doing? If many are sheltering in place, your community can contribute to the greater good of the region by also sheltering in place.
What are the demographics of my community? Is there a large at-risk population, including seniors, low-income individuals, and individuals with health issues? These individuals would benefit disproportionately from a shelter in place order.
Do a high proportion of individuals in my community rely on local institutions for basic needs? For example, do a majority of students receive free and reduced-price lunch? There must be a plan for distributing these essential services while sheltering in place.
What is the density of housing in my community? The virus will spread more rapidly in dense communities.
Do people in my community typically rely on cars or public transit? The virus will spread more rapidly in communities with a large public transit base.
What is the current and projected strain on hospitals/health care in my region (both with respect to COVID-19 and otherwise)? Do our hospitals have enough hospital beds, ICU beds, ventilators, and PPE? When the virus arrives, it will put further strain on local hospitals and health care workers, so flattening the curve now will mitigate the risk of the local healthcare system becoming overwhelmed.
Have any health care/emergency workers in my community or in nearby communities tested positive? The safety of health care and emergency workers must be prioritized. Issuing a shelter in place can help you achieve this.
Have you tried to get support from local community and business leaders? It will likely be easier to achieve a successful shelter in place if you have the support and/or understanding of the community.

 Pregnant healthcare  personnel (HCP) should follow risk assessment and infection control guidelines  for HCP exposed to patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, which are  available on the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website.   The adherence to recommended infection  prevention and control practices is an important part of protecting all HCP in  healthcare settings.  Information on  COVID-19 in pregnancy is very limited; facilities may want to consider limiting  exposure of pregnant HCP to patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19,  especially during higher risk procedures (e.g., aerosol-generating procedures)  if feasible based on staffing availability.    Additional information is available on the New York State Department of  Health (DOH) website and through DOH’s Coronavirus Hotline 1-888-364-3065.   Please continue to monitor these websites  and hotlines for updated guidance. <SEP> Are pregnant nurses at increased risk if they  care for patients with COVID-19? <EOS>

The FDA’s Center for Veterinary Medicine has recently become aware of increased public visibility of the antiparasitic drug ivermectin after the announcement of a research article that described the effect of ivermectin on SARS-CoV-2 in a laboratory setting. The Antiviral Research pre-publication paper, “The FDA-approved drug ivermectin inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro,” documents how SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) responded to ivermectin when exposed in a petri dish. This type of study is commonly used in the early stages of drug development. Ivermectin was not given to people or animals in this study.
Additional testing is needed to determine whether ivermectin might be safe or effective to prevent or treat coronavirus or COVID-19. While there are approved uses for ivermectin in people and animals, it is not approved for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. You should not take any medicine to treat or prevent COVID-19 unless it has been prescribed to you by your healthcare provider and acquired from a legitimate source.
For additional information, please see the FDA Letter to Stakeholders: Do Not Use Ivermectin Intended for Animals as Treatment for COVID-19 in Humans and FDA FAQs: COVID-19 and Ivermectin Intended for Animals. <SEP> Is ivermectin an effective treatment for COVID-19? <EOS>
Social distancing means remaining out of:

Public places where close contact with others may occur (such as shopping centers, movie theaters, stadiums).
Workplaces (unless the person works in an office space that allows distancing from others).
Schools and other classroom settings.
Local public transportation (such as on a bus, subway, taxi, ride share, plane, ship)
Maintaining a distance of at least 6 feet from others when at all possible

Everyone in Virginia is encouraged to practice social distancing until the threat of COVID-19 subsides.  The most important thing to do to lower the risk of exposure is maintain social distancing.
It is very important that people with even mild signs of illness (fever, cough, chills, muscle pain, sore throat, or new loss of taste or smell) stay home to prevent spreading illness to others! <SEP> What is social distancing? <EOS>
The current Social Distancing Protocol contains up-to-date public health measures designed to help prevent the spread
    of COVID-19 at business facilities in the County. If your business is allowed to operate, strictly implementing
    these health and safety protocols is the best way to protect yourself, your workers, and your customers from
    COVID-19 when they are at your business facility. The updated COVID-19 PREPARED Sign and Social Distancing Protocol
    Visitor Information Sheet that must be posted are also designed to show workers and the public that your business is
    both complying with these requirements and doing its part to keep the community safe. <SEP> Why are Social Distancing Protocols required? <EOS>
Yes.  The local Health Officer Order and the Social Distancing Protocol impose social distancing
            requirements, which apply to all people inside your facility (and elsewhere throughout the
    County,
    whenever people are at not at home).  In addition, the Order and the Social Distancing Protocol also impose
    density limitations, which require you to limit the total
    number of people inside your facility at
    any time.  Both requirements are important to make sure that you avoid crowding in your facility and keep
    customers and workers safe.
You can think about the density requirements as how many people you may let in before another person leaves.
     You can think about the social distancing requirement as the closest anyone inside the facility is allowed to
    get to anyone not in their household.  Businesses are responsible for calculating the maximum density and
    making sure it is never exceeded by controlling how many people the business lets in at a time; and businesses,
    their workers, and customers all have to work together to make sure social distancing is observed.

Example: A warehouse has 25,000 gross square feet of facility space. The warehouse must limit the
        workers inside the facility at any time to a maximum of 100 (1 worker per 250 gross square feet).
         And, once workers are inside the facility, they must stay at least 6 feet away from
        everyone not in their household. <SEP> Do I still need to limit the number of people inside my facility even if I make sure that everyone stays at
        least 6 feet apart from each other while inside? <EOS>
Yes, places of worship can open for services and communal prayer in line with guidance for reopening Places of Worship. We advise that you limit your social interaction in these venues to your own household and up to one other, wherever possible.

Anyone can get tested for COVID-19 – even those without symptoms.  Immediate testing is highly encouraged for those with symptoms.  Testing is also highly encouraged for anyone who was told by a Delaware Contact Tracer, that they may have been exposed to, or were a contact of, someone with COVID-19.  Close contacts should only be tested AFTER their recommended 14-day quarantine period has ended, because the test may become positive at any point during the 14 days after exposure.
Lastly, those with frequent or high-risk contact with others including health care workers, first responders, those in the hospitality (food/hotel) industry, and critical infrastructure personnel, are recommended to obtain testing at regular intervals even when they do not have symptoms. We recommend you examine the table below to see if you work in a job which is recommended to undergo routine testing. <SEP> Who should be tested? <EOS>
No. WHO does not recommend that asymptomatic individuals (i.e., who do not have respiratory symptoms) in the community should wear medical masks, as currently there is no evidence that routine use of medical masks by healthy individuals prevents 2019-nCoV
    transmission. Masks are recommended to be used by symptomatic persons in the community. Misuse and overuse of medical masks may cause serious issues of shortage of stocks and lack of mask availability for those who actually need to wear them. In health care facilities where health care workers are directly taking care of suspect or confirmed 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease patients, masks are an important part of containing 2019-nCoV spread between people, along with other PPE and hand
    hygiene.Click here for more information on medical mask use. <SEP> Does WHO recommend routine wearing masks for healthy people during the 2019 nCoV outbreak? <EOS>
Seek medical care, if members of your family get seriously ill.  If possible, either you or an adult should phone the local or national COVID-19 emergency number for advice on where and how you could get care. If your family member is confirmed as having COVID-19, you must be prepared that you and other known contacts will need to monitor your symptoms, and continue to self-quarantine for 14 days, even if you feel healthy.Read more:https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public <SEP> What should I do if someone in my family gets really ill with COVID-19? <EOS>
For employees who are fearful to physically report to work but provide a critical service per the business continuity plan, it is our advice that they be provided with any and all information to demonstrate that we have taken measures to protect their health and safety. Engagement with the Local Occupational Health and Safety committee is recommended. Should they still not want to report, they will need to exercise their right to refuse work under the Canada Labour Code. Contact your General Safety Officer, General Safety (D Safe G, VCDS) or OHSSecretariatSST@forces.gc.ca.
If the employee has a specific vulnerability (i.e. elderly age category based on GC COVID-19 guidelines, compromised immune system, etc.), they could make a written, signed statement to that affect, and commit to providing a medical certificate to substantiate at a future date. <SEP> Someone I manage doesn’t want to come to work but they perform a critical service.

As of March 2020, there have been reports of the suspension of insecticide-treated net (ITN) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) campaigns in several African countries due to concerns around exposure to COVID-19. Suspending such campaigns will leave many vulnerable populations at greater risk of malaria, particularly young children and pregnant women. WHO strongly encourages countries not to suspend the planning for – or implementation of – vector control activities, including ITN and IRS campaigns, while ensuring these services are delivered using best practices to protect health workers and communities from COVID-19 infection. Modifications of planned distribution strategies may be needed to minimize exposure to the coronavirus. WHO commends the leaders of Benin, Chad, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mali, Niger, Sierra Leone and Uganda for committing to move forward with ITN campaigns during the pandemic. Other countries are adapting their net distribution strategies to ensure households receive the nets as quickly and safely as possible.Together with partners, WHO has developed guidance to ensure that those suffering from malaria can safely receive the care they need in COVID-19 settings. Tailoring malaria interventions in the COVID-19 responseincludes guidance on the prevention of infection through vector control and chemoprevention, testing, treatment of cases, clinical services, supply chain and laboratory activities. The document is consistent with broader WHO guidance on how to maintain essential health services during the pandemic. <SEP> Should core malaria vector control interventions be maintained in view of the rapid global spread of COVID-19? <EOS>
No. Exercising is an important way of keeping yourself healthy and of ensuring your immune system stays strong but it does not prevent you from getting COVID-19. Regular exercise is important for staying fit and keeping you mentally well, so try to do some exercise daily during the sheltering-in-place and beyond. Prevention, however, involves physical distancing from all people other than your household group, washing your hands, not touching your face when out in public places and wearing a mask in those countries that require this. <SEP> Will exercise prevent COVID-19? <EOS>
Currently there is no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.However, drugs previously developed to treat other viral infections are being tested to see if they might also be effective against the virus that causes COVID-19. <SEP> Is there an antiviral treatment for COVID-19? <EOS>

Yes, when systematically applied, contact tracing will break the chains of transmission, meaning that the virus transmission can be stopped. Contact tracing is thus an essential public health tool for controlling infectious disease outbreaks, such as COVID-19. <SEP> Can contact tracing help in controlling spread of the virus? <EOS>
No, you should not. The recommendation from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, the state of California and Los Angeles County to wear a cloth facial covering whenever you venture out comes with one exclusion—children under age 2. The primary reason, as Children’s Hospital Los Angeles infectious diseases physician Michael Smit, MD, explains, is the mask’s potential to cause breathing difficulties for a small child. That combined with babies’ inability to convey their distress or remove the mask on their own could create the threat of suffocation.
“They can’t communicate readily if they’re having problems breathing,” says Dr. Smit, CHLA’s Medical Director of Infection Prevention and Control. “You don’t want to think that you’re trying to help your child by putting a cloth mask on them, and then inadvertently put them at risk for suffocating themselves.” <SEP> Should I put a mask on my baby? <EOS>

People with COVID-19 have reported a wide range of symptoms – from mild symptoms to severe illness. Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. If you have fever, cough, or other symptoms, you might have COVID-19. <SEP> What are the symptoms and complications that COVID-19 can cause? <EOS>
Stomach troubles aren't a common symptom of the coronavirus, but a fever is a key symptom, so it's unlikely that you have it. However, if you have any questions, call ahead to your doctor and make an appointment. <SEP> I have a few symptoms like the stomachache, congestion, and diarrhea but no fever. Is it possible I have the virus? <EOS>
Sick people should not be going to school even when there isn’t a pandemic. During a pandemic, all governments are asking people to stay at home if they feel unwell, whatever the cause. They may pose a risk to others and they also place themselves at higher risk for COVID-19 because their immune system will be fighting the illness they already have, which means it isn’t as strong as it would be for a healthy person. If you see that someone is sick, alert your teacher immediately so that they can help isolate the sick student immediately and get them home quickly. The school will then advise on whether or not there is a need for some or all other students to self-isolate, depending on why the student was sick. <SEP> How do I keep away from sick people at school? What can I do? <EOS>
Clean, natural ventilation should be used inside buildings where possible, without re-circulating the air. If air re-circulation is necessary, filters and duct systems should be cleaned regularly and routinely changed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Heating and cooling systems should be well maintained. <SEP> Are there any specific recommendations on school ventilation and air conditioning use? <EOS>
Yes, delivery of intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp), seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC), and intermittent preventive treatment in infants (IPTi) should be maintained provided that best practices for protecting health workers – and other front-line workers – from COVID-19 are followed. Ensuring access to these and other core malaria prevention tools saves lives and is an important strategy for reducing the strain on health systems in the context of the COVID-19 response.Tailoring malaria interventions in the COVID-19 response, developed by WHO and partners, includes guidance on how to deliver preventive therapies for pregnant women and young children in ways that protect health workers and communities against potential COVID-19 transmission. <SEP> Should WHO-recommended preventive therapies be maintained in sub-Saharan Africa? <EOS>
Yes. Continue to administer these vaccines if an in-person visit must be scheduled for some other purpose and the clinical preventive service can be delivered during that visit with no additional risk; or an individual patient and their clinician believe that there is a compelling need to receive the service based on an assessment that the potential benefit outweighs the risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 virus.

There are steps you can take to reduce your risk of getting and spreading coronavirus:

Wear a face mask anytime you go within six feet of anyone not in your immediate household. Also wear a mask when you leave the home and enter public spaces, such as a store, taxi, or communal gathering space. 
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol if soap and water aren't available.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, then throw the tissue in the trash and wash your hands.
Clean and disinfect objects and surfaces.
Stay home if you are sick. Stay home as much as possible. Stay home and stay healthy. Follow Governor Inslee​'s extended Stay Home- Stay Healthy order.
Stay six feet away from others.
Follow recommendations from your local health department. <SEP> How can I protect myself and others? <EOS>
Working with a team of leading data scientists and epidemiologists, the State is using several dynamic epidemiology and growth models to predict the spread of the virus and the need for hospital beds, intensive care units, ventilators, and personal protective equipment at a hospital, county, and statewide level.
The models take into account New Jersey's aggressive social distancing policy along with what happened in other countries and tailor those findings to the variations observed at a county level and even hospital level in our state. By using a combination of models, we have been able to achieve accurate predictions for 10-day forecasts, and have also established long-term forecasts.
More specifically, to account for the aggressive social distancing policy in New Jersey, we have developed multiple adaptive growth models using Multivariate Hawkes processes and control theory principles for short-term forecasting -- these models were developed by researchers at New York University and Facebook AI research. For long-term forecasting, the State uses multiple models including dynamic versions of SIR models and SEIR models, and "stay at home" growth variation modeling using transfer learning algorithms developed by researchers at New York University. The State is also continuously monitoring the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) model as well as the COVID-19 Hospital Impact Model for Epidemics (CHIME), developed by University of Pennsylvania's School of Medicine's Predictive Healthcare Team.
Short-Term Forecasting

Adaptive Growth Model with Cross-County Clustering: In this model, developed by Lakshmi Subramanian of the NYU Courant Institute and Srikanth Jagabathula of the NYU Stern School of Business, we directly estimate the growth rate of new confirmed cases at a county level using a learning rate equation commonly used in control theory and gradient descent algorithms. We used exponential smoothing of the parameter inputs to account for county-level spikes, reporting, and testing fluctuations. We use cross-county clustering to learn early growth rate variations in counties with very limited data and smooth the variations across counties.
Multivariate Hawkes Process: Another model the State uses for short-term forecasting, developed by Facebook's AI team, trains a multivariate Hawkes process (which is commonly used in financial stock price modeling) to train a county-level model and a collective state-level model.

Both these models are re-trained on a daily basis and provide 7-14 day forecasts.
Long-Term Forecasting

Dynamic SIR: The SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) model is widely used for epidemiology modeling. The CHIME (COVID-19 Hospital Impact Model for Epidemics) tool uses the SIR model, but manually sets the parameters of the SIR model based on doubling time and social distancing. While the CHIME model does leverage a social distancing parameter, the State also uses a dynamic SIR model that adapts the mixing rate (which captures the number of people each infected person comes in contact with) parameter based on the data observed in growth rate variations at a county level to provide an additional long-term model that further captures the impact of the "stay at home" order currently in place in New Jersey.
Dynamic SEIR model: Expanding upon our Dynamic SIR model, we trained the parameters of an SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered) model in a dynamic manner at a county level based on the growth variations observed in the data at a county and state level. The dynamic SEIR model - developed by Subramanian and Jagabathula - uses the growth variations to adaptively adjust the SEIR parameters, in essence, varying the R0 value of the epidemiology model over time to capture the impact of the "stay at home" order currently in place in New Jersey.
"Stay at Home" Growth Variation Modeling using Transfer Learning: Traditional epidemiology models do not capture movement limitation behavior. To account for that, in this model - also developed by Subramanian and Jagabathula - we study the growth-rate variations in other countries after "stay at home" orders have been issues and use transfer learning to determine the appropriate growth variations that best fit the data for New Jersey. This model is especially useful for learning best case, expected case, and worst-case scenarios of peaks.

With the help of this ensemble of forecasts, the State is better able to make difficult decisions on what critical resources to acquire, where to deploy these critical resources, anticipate potential hot spots, and ensure that those who need care can get it when they need it most. <SEP> How is the State using data to make decisions and slow the spread of COVID-19? <EOS>
It is not yet known whether weather and temperature affect the spread of COVID-19. Some other viruses, like those that cause the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months.  There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing. <SEP> Will warm weather stop the outbreak of COVID-19? <EOS>

When a person tests positive for a disease or condition, a public health case investigator will work with the patient to create a list of people they’ve been in contact with during a given time frame. The contact tracing expert then contacts each of those people so that they can take appropriate precautions (getting tested, self-isolation, monitor for symptoms, etc.) and, in turn, create a list of people they’ve been in contact with as necessary. By using this strategy, public health professionals can get ahead of infectious diseases and prevent further spread. <SEP> How does contact tracing work? <EOS>
Ernest Shackleton hired for attitude and trained for skill. He sought people who were comfortable in uncertainty and attitudinally ready for a very real, very serious challenge. Think about the attitude, the work ethic, and the resumé, but that's only part of a much broader set of criteria in hiring people for great uncertainty and high stakes situations. (Nancy Koehn, 4/29/20)
If you are recruiting for a dangerous and difficult mission, be blunt with people about how hard it will be. That way your applicants will be self-selected for toughness, or at least for thinking of themselves as tough.

There are currently no antiviral drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat COVID-19. Some in-vitro or in-vivo studies suggest potential therapeutic activity of some agents against related coronaviruses, but there are no available data from observational studies or randomized controlled trials in humans to support recommending any investigational therapeutics for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 at this time. Remdesivir and chloroquine are being evaluated as possible drug therapies for COVID-19, but it is too early to say whether or not either will improve clinical outcomes at this time. More information on remdesivir clinical trials and expanded access program can be found on Gilead’s website. Based upon limited in-vitro and anecdotal data, chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine are currently recommended for treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in several countries. Because there is currently no recommendation for outpatient use, it is imperative that ‘stockpiling’ of these drugs does not occur to ensure the drugs are available for those currently taking these medications for other approved medical conditions or those hospitalized patients in critical need. To ensure an adequate supply, the Virginia Department of Health in consultation with the Virginia Department of Health Professions recommends the following:
•Prescriptions for chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, mefloquine and azithromycin should be restricted in the outpatient setting and should require a diagnosis “consistent with the evidence for its use.”
•Community pharmacists should use professional judgement to determine whether a prescription is valid and that there is a bona fide practitioner-patient relationship prior to dispensing.
•Prioritize treatment for continuation of existing medication therapy, inpatient settings, and other indications where there is not an alternative therapy.
•Advise against hoarding these medications or stockpiling.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) describes the appropriate biosafety level (BSL) protection  for various types of tasks in its Interim Guidelines for Collecting, Handling, and Testing Clinical Specimens for COVID-19 and Interim Laboratory Biosafety Guidelines for Handling and Processing Specimens Associated with COVID-19.
In general, CDC recommends that for:

Routine diagnostic testing of clinical  specimens (e.g., processing initial samples, applying stains to fixed smears, and pathologic examination of inactivated tissues), work should be performed at  BSL-2; 
Environmental specimen testing that involves  virus concentration procedures (e.g., sewage surveillance testing), work should be performed at BSL-2 with BSL-3 precautions, including respiratory protection  and a designated area for putting on and taking off personal protective  equipment; 
Virus isolation in cell cultures, work should  be performed at BSL-3; 
Environmental specimen testing that  concentrates virus, work should be performed at BSL-2 with BSL-3 precautions. 

For viral testing of specimens  conducted outside of a BSL-2 laboratory, such as rapid respiratory testing  performed at the point of care, use standard precautions to provide a barrier  between the specimen and personnel during specimen manipulation. For more  information on specimen collection, handling, and testing, refer to the  CDC's Interim Guidelines for Collecting, Handling, and Testing Clinical Specimens for COVID-19.
Aerosol-generating procedures and work with concentrated virus should always be performed in an appropriately maintained and certified biosafety cabinet. 
OSHA also discusses laboratory biosafety on its COVID-19 Safety and Health Topics page. This guidance is generally  consistent with CDC's Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL), 5th Edition. <SEP> I am a lab technician, and I work  with samples that contain (or may contain) SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes  COVID-19.

Getting early immunizations in for babies and toddlers — especially babies 6 months and younger — has important benefits. It helps to protect them from infections such as pneumococcus and pertussis that can be deadly, at a time when their immune system is vulnerable.For children older than 2 years, waiting a bit longer may be okay. But for some children with special conditions, or those who are behind on immunizations, waiting may not be a good idea. The best thing to do is call your doctor's office. Find out what precautions they are taking to keep children safe, and discuss your particular situation, including not only your child's health situation, but also the prevalence of the virus in your community and whether you have been or might have been exposed. Together, you can make the best decision for your child. <SEP> Should parents take babies for initial vaccines right now? What about toddlers and up who are due for vaccines? <EOS>
Always practice social (physical) distancing from the ill person, as well as from other persons when you’re on a walk with a dog. Practice handwashing when entering the person’s home. Avoid touching surfaces in the person’s home as much as possible. Do not share food, kiss, or hug the pet, or allow the pet to lick you; and wash your hands before and after any contact with the pet and their supplies. You should not share dishes, drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils with the ill person or pet. After you attend to the pet and go home, wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds, and wash your clothes. <SEP> I am helping someone who is sick with COVID-19 by walking their dog/caring for their pet.

Mutations occur in SARS-CoV-2, just like with most viruses, but it is unknown currently whether these mutations will lead to the development of a new strain. Active research efforts to learn more about mutations of the virus are ongoing. This research will eventually lead to a better classification of viral lineages, which will allow us to construct a “family tree” to better understand and track how the virus has changed over time and to determine if a new strain has emerged.
Additionally, laboratory research is underway to determine if certain natural mutations in the virus might cause greater damage to human cells. This initial research must be matched with real-world observations of patient illness in order to show that a particular mutation or strain does indeed lead to more severe illness in infected people. <SEP> Are there different strains of SARS-CoV-2 in circulation? Do some cause more severe illness than others? <EOS>
Yes. The Executive Order requires that face coverings be worn in any indoor public space or indoor business—including polling places. Voters who refuse to wear a  face covering within the polling place will be provided with the opportunity to vote using curbside voting procedures which will allow the voter to vote outside and without violating the Executive Order.
 A voter who refuses to wear a face covering and refuses the curbside option will not be prevented from voting. However, any individual who fails to comply with the Executive Order—whether in a polling place or other indoor public space or business—may be subject to a petty misdemeanor citation and a fine of up to $100.

The stay-at-home and physical distancing measures that have been imposed throughout the EU/EEA and the UK are highly disruptive to society, both economically and socially, and there is very wide agreement that they should be lifted as soon as it is safe to do so. However, lifting the measures too early or too quickly carries the risk of a rapid return to high infection rates, and this could overwhelm the health system while causing high levels of illness and many deaths. The Joint European Roadmap towards lifting COVID-19 containment measures addresses this issue by providing the framework for an economic and social recovery plan for the EU alongside a set of public health principles that are aimed at minimising the risk of a resurgence in the number of cases. Should a resurgence occur, the stay-at-home and physical distancing measures may need to be put in place again.

The scientific advice shows that when domestic transmission is high, cases from abroad represent a small amount of the overall total and make no significant difference to the epidemic. Now that domestic transmission within the UK is coming under control, we need to impose measures relating to people arriving in the UK. Exemptions are in place for some countries where the risk of transmission is low. Find out more about self-isolation when you travel to the UK.
In England, if you are required to self-isolate and do not, you can be fined £1,000. If you do not provide an accurate contact detail declaration – or do not update your contact detail form in the limited circumstances where you need to move to another place to self-isolate – you can be fined.

The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person,
  between people who are in close contact with one another (within
  about 6 feet), and via respiratory droplets produced when an
  infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the
  mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled
  into the lungs. See CDC’s How
  Coronavirus Spreads. <SEP> HOW DOES THE VIRUS SPREAD? <EOS>
It’s a moving target, and depends a lot on where you live and when. If you’re somewhere with an outbreak, you’re at higher risk. If your state is reopening and cases are climbing, your risk is highest. 
Lots of factors determine how sick you actually get. Younger people tend to do better than older people, and having underlying conditions increases your risk. And if you were exposed to a lot of the virus — as many essential workers were — you have a higher risk of getting a severe case. 
Black and Latino people have been disproportionately affected by the coronavirus in a widespread manner that spans the country, throughout hundreds of counties in urban, suburban and rural areas, and across all age groups.
However, a better question might be what your chances are of getting someone else sick. People in their 20s, 30s and 40s account for a growing proportion of the cases in many places, raising fears that asymptomatic young people are helping to fuel the virus’s spread. 
Most people have a low chance of getting a severe case. But if you’re not careful, you have a very high chance of infecting someone who is vulnerable. It’s sort of like drunken driving. You could harm yourself, but you could also harm other people, too. That’s why we don't do it. <SEP> What are my chances of getting sick? <EOS>

Yes, wearing a mask will help prevent the spread of COVID-19. Wearing a face mask helps to catch the droplets that come out of your mouth when you speak, cough, or breathe. If you have COVID-19, the virus will be contained in the droplets, and if they get on other people, they can get sick, too. By wearing a mask, you are lowering the chance of spreading your droplets to other people, which can lower the chance of spreading COVID-19. 
Even if you don’t have the symptoms of COVID-19, you could still be sick. Many people who are infected with the virus are asymptomatic, but they can still spread the virus to others. <SEP> Will wearing a mask stop me from spreading COVID-19 to others? <EOS>

CDC does NOT recommend that employers use antibody tests to determine which employees can work. Antibody tests check a blood sample for past infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. CDC does not yet know if people who recover from COVID-19 can get infected again. Viral tests check a respiratory sample (such as swabs of the inside of the nose) for current infection with SARS-CoV-2.
CDC has published strategies for consideration of incorporating viral testing for SARS-CoV-2 into a workplace COVID-19 preparedness, response, and control plan.
Different states and jurisdictions may have their own guidance and priorities for viral testing in workplaces. Testing in the workplace could be arranged through a company’s occupational health provider or in consultation with the local or state health department. <SEP> What testing does CDC recommend for employees in a workplace? <EOS>

Like most viruses, SARS-CoV-2, the virus strain behind COVID-19, accumulates modest mutations in its genetic sequence over time as a result of replication errors. Genomic epidemiologists try to map the spread of the virus by analyzing these mutations. For example, one study concluded that the New York City outbreak was likely seeded by COVID-19 cases from Europe, while the SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced in Washington State point to a Wuhan origin. (Dr. Josh Sharfstein, 5/29/20) <SEP> What is RNA mutation genome analysis and how does it inform our understanding about the virus’ spread? <EOS>

Under the Governor’s face covering mandate, agency employees must wear face coverings when they are working indoors, waiting outdoors to enter an indoor space, working outdoors when it is not possible to maintain social distancing, and when in vehicles used for agency business. Face coverings can be removed temporarily in certain situations, especially when the employee is alone in an enclosed space. Employees also may be exempt from the face covering requirement if a disability makes it unreasonable for them to wear a face covering. See HR/LR Policy #1442 Face Coverings Policy for Agency Staff for details.

Molecular tests look for evidence of an active infection. Serum antibody tests are a different kind of test that measure the body’s response to infection: antibodies, which take time to develop—about five days or more after initial infection. There are different kinds of antibody tests. In general, molecular tests and antibody tests are not replaceable with one another, because they measure different things. (Dr. Josh Sharfstein, 4/4/20) <SEP> What is the difference between molecular tests and serology tests? Can serology tests be used in place of molecular tests? <EOS>
Coronaviruses are viruses that circulate among animals with some of them also known to infect humans.
Bats are considered natural hosts of these viruses yet several other species of animals are also known to act as sources. For instance, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is transmitted to humans from camels, and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1) is transmitted to humans from civet cats.

“The curve” refers to a graph of the number of new cases of COVID-19 per day.  Flattening the curve means we want to push the number of new cases reported each day down as much as we can.  The current aim of the global response is to slow, or stop, the transmission of coronavirus. This way, fewer people become infected at the same time. If many people become infected with the virus at the same time, this could overwhelm the medical care system – this is what we are actively trying to avoid.
Current infection prevention and control measures such as social distancing, closing schools, bar seating, and restricting capacity at  fitness centers, restaurants, etc. are all ways to reduce places where people can congregate.  This is done to help reduce the number of new infections. By following these practices, we can all help slow the spread of COVID-19 and prevent the healthcare system from becoming overwhelmed with patients. <SEP> What does “flatten the curve” mean? <EOS>
CDC does not have any evidence to suggest that imported animals or animal products pose a risk for spreading COVID-19 in the United States. This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) play distinct but complementary roles in regulating the importation of live animals and animal products into the United States. CDC regulates animals and animal products that pose a threat to human health, USDA regulates animals and animal products that pose a threat to agriculture; and FWS regulates importation of endangered species and wildlife that can harm the health and welfare of humans, the interests of agriculture, horticulture, or forestry, and the welfare and survival of wildlife resources.

Chlorine solutions are strongly discouraged as they carry a higher risk of hand irritation and ill health effects from making and diluting chlorine solutions, including eye irritation and respiratory problems. In addition, there is a risk of loss of antimicrobial effect if exposed to sunlight or heat.  Preparing chlorine solutions requires training to reach the correct dose of 0.05% with varying strengths of bleach available in the private sector.  Even if stored at a cool dry place with a lid away from sunlight, they have to be renewed daily.  In comparison simple soapy water solution do not have any of the above-mentioned health risks and complications including loss of antiviral effect due to heat or sunlight.  The antiviral effect of soapy water is due to the oily surface membrane of the COVID-virus that is dissolved by soap, killing the virus. <SEP> Can chlorine solutions also be used? <EOS>
The onset and duration of viral shedding and period of infectiousness for COVID-19 are not yet conclusively known; however, early evidence indicates that people are likely most infectious right after contracting the virus, possibly before knowing they're sick.
It is possible that SARS-CoV-2 RNA may be detectable in the upper or lower respiratory tract for weeks after illness onset, similar to infection with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. However, detection of viral RNA does not necessarily mean that infectious virus is present. Asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2 has been reported, but it is not yet known what role asymptomatic infection plays in transmission. Similarly, the role of pre-symptomatic transmission (infection detection during the incubation period prior to illness onset) is unknown. Existing literature regarding SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses (e.g. MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV) suggest that the incubation period may range from 2–14 days.

OSHA recommends that, during the ongoing pandemic and associated community spread of COVID-19, all workers  wear face coverings to prevent the spread of their respiratory droplets. This  is because people can spread SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, by  coughing, sneezing, or talking—even if they do not feel sick. Because  of other exposures in healthcare settings, healthcare workers may need to wear  surgical masks to prevent or reduce the risk of this transmission, while also  protecting themselves from exposure to patients' potentially infectious  respiratory droplets and other splashes or sprays of body fluids.
Healthcare workers and employers should also consult OSHA and CDC guidance to find  out if they need additional types of personal protective equipment. OSHA  recommends that healthcare workers with exposure to suspected or confirmed  COVID-19 patients wear PPE ensembles that include N95 or better filtering  facepiece respirators. For healthcare workers providing patient care to other  patients (i.e., those who are known suspected of having or known to have  COVID-19) in communities with ongoing community transmission, surgical masks  can be used in conjunction with face shields or goggles to protect the wearer  from exposure to others' respiratory droplets and splashes or sprays of other  body fluids that can spread diseases. In these instances, the combination of  surgical masks with face shields or goggles can reduce the risk of exposure to  the virus when caring for people who may spread COVID-19 without knowing they  have it. For some activities, including aerosol-generating procedures, healthcare  workers likely need N95 or better filtering facepieces respirators. N95 or  better respirators should be used in accordance with a respiratory protection program. <SEP> I am a healthcare worker who  previously provided direct patient care without a mask.

Facilities should follow the reporting requirements of their state or jurisdiction. Those regulated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) (e.g., nursing homes) should also follow all CMS requirementspdf iconexternal icon, which are being updated to include new requirements for reporting to CDC and to residents and their representatives.
In addition, CDC recommends that health departments be promptly notified about:

Residents or healthcare personnel (HCP) with suspected or confirmed COVID-19,
Residents with severe respiratory infection resulting in hospitalization or death, and
 ≥ 3 residents or HCP with new-onset respiratory symptoms within 72 hours of each other.

These could signal an outbreak of COVID-19 or other respiratory disease in the facility. The health department can provide important guidance to assist with case finding and halting transmission.
The facility should also have a plan and mechanism to regularly communicate with residents, family members, and HCP, including if cases of COVID-19 are identified in the facility. Often, information in nursing homes is communicated through town hall meetings and staff meetings, along with letters or emails. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, in-person gatherings should not occur. Instead, communication should occur through virtual meetings over phone or web platforms. These should be supplemented with written communications that provide contact information for a staff member who can respond to questions or concerns. Communications should include information describing the current situation, plans for limiting spread within the facility, and recommended actions they can take to protect themselves and others. Facilities should make this information available in a timely manner and offer periodic updates as the situation develops and more information becomes available. <SEP> If a long-term care facility has a resident or staff member with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, how and to whom should this be communicated? <EOS>
Masks or cloth face coverings on adults and kids over 2 years old
               can help slow the spread of the virus. Here are some ways to help kids wear masks
               when you go out:

Help kids get used to masks. As much as you can, give kids time
               to practice wearing their masks before they might need to wear one outside of your
               home. Teach them how to put them on and take them off.
Encourage kids to decorate their mask. This might help them feel
               a sense of ownership and control over the situation. A personal touch can help make
               it more of a normal part of their routine, and make it more likely they'll want to
               wear their mask. Depending on the type of mask, kids can draw on it with markers or
               put stickers on it.
Make them together. If you make masks or cloth face coverings
               at home, let older kids help you. There are no-sew masks that are easy to make, often
               with materials you probably already have (T-shirts, bandannas, etc.). If you sew masks,
               maybe kids can select the fabric or patterns for the masks they'll wear.
Help make it fun. With younger kids, introduce a sense of play.
               Kids can pretend to be a doctor or nurse while wearing their masks. They might want
               to use a doctor kit and "take care" of a stuffed animal or doll.
Have a few masks handy while kids play. This lets them use their
               imagination about how to use them during playtime. It also helps make masks a more
               normal part of their everyday world. You can ask your child to put a mask on a stuffed
               animal, and then ask follow-up questions about why the stuffed animal is wearing the
               mask. Depending on your child's response, you can clear up any confusion and offer
               reassurance. <SEP> How Can Parents Help Kids Wear a Mask? <EOS>

You are required to wear a face covering in public settings, including in grocery stores, convenience stores, pharmacies, doctor’s offices, and on public transportation. Wearing a cloth face covering does not eliminate the need to physically distance yourself from others. If you are sick, you should wear a cloth face covering, over your nose and mouth if you must be around other people — even while at home. <SEP> When should I wear a cloth face covering? <EOS>
No, HCP do not need to be tested at each facility. If documentation of the test result is provided to each facility, the results from one setting are adequate to meet the testing recommendations at any facility. Each facility should maintain appropriate documentation of test results and have a plan to evaluate and manage HCP. HCP should be encouraged to tell facilities if they have had exposures at other facilities with recognized COVID-19 cases. <SEP> If HCP work at multiple facilities, do they need to receive a viral test at each facility? <EOS>
Anyone who comes into close contact with someone who has COVID-19 is at increased risk of becoming infected themselves, and of potentially infecting others. Contact tracing can help prevent further transmission of the virus by quickly identifying and informing people who may be infected and contagious, so they can take steps to not infect others.Contact tracing begins with identifying everyone that a person recently diagnosed with COVID-19 has been in contact with since they became contagious. In the case of COVID-19, a person may be contagious 48 to 72 hours before they started to experience symptoms.The contacts are notified about their exposure. They may be told what symptoms to look out for, advised to isolate themselves for a period of time, and to seek medical attention as needed if they start to experience symptoms. <SEP> How could contact tracing help slow the spread of COVID-19? <EOS>
Providers should not rely solely on information provided by AHCCCS. More information about eligibility and the application process is available at the CARES Act General Information webpage. <SEP>  On June 9, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) through the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA),announced distributions from the Provider Relief Fund to eligible Medicaid and CHIP providers.

Dexamethasone was used in the Recovery Trial in oral (liquid or tablets) or intravenous preparation 6 mg once daily for ten days.In pregnancy or breastfeeding women, prednisolone 40 mg administered by mouth (or intravenous hydrocortisone 80 mg twice daily) should be used instead of dexamethasone.Note: It is permitted to switch between the two routes of administration according to clinical circumstances.Source: Page 9 of 35 RECOVERY [V6.0 2020-05-14] ISRCTN50189673 EudraCT 2020-001113-21 <SEP> What dose was used in the Recovery trial? <EOS>
The department adheres to the directives and guidance from the Public Health Agency of Canada, as well as national and provincial regulations and best practices, regarding the cleaning and sanitation of workplaces. In certain circumstances, such as a known respiratory infection outbreak or under the advice of the Senior Medical Authority, it may be necessary to increase the frequency of environmental cleaning to reduce and control the spread of microorganisms.
PHAC guidance can be found at the following link: https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/cleaning-disinfecting-public-spaces.html. <SEP> Regarding cleaning and sanitization of common spaces in DND/CAF facilities, what extra training will cleaning staff/contractors receive to ensure they are following best practices to reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19? What standards will they be required to follow? <EOS>
First of all, treat all deliveries as if they might be contaminated. Secondly, take precautions before handling your envelopes or delivery boxes. According to research by NIH, coronavirus may remain on paper surfaces to up to 72 hours and therefore, you may want to let your packages to sit outside for that period of time before touching them. The same applies to paper currency.  Either avoid using it or let it sit undisturbed for 72 hours before you handle it. <SEP> How can I disinfect paper? I need to send a thank you note and some paper currency to a neighbor for watching my pets recently. I want to ensure what I send will not be carrying any coronavirus. <EOS>
It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to behave like other coronaviruses. Studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment).
If you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple disinfectant to kill the virus and protect yourself and others. Clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Avoid touching your eyes, mouth, or nose. <SEP> How long does the virus survive on surfaces? <EOS>
No. Allergy symptoms are not considered an acute respiratory illness. However, there is some overlap between common seasonal allergy symptoms and some of the symptoms that have been reported by people with COVID-19 (e.g., headache, sneezing, cough). It is important to take into account whether an individual’s symptoms are compatible with the usual symptoms and timing for allergy in that person. <SEP> Are allergy symptoms considered an acute respiratory illness? <EOS>
Coronavirus refers to viruses belonging to a large family of viruses that cause respiratory infections. The most well known form of a coronavirus is the common cold, while more serious strains of coronaviruses include Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). COVID-19 is a coronavirus and was termed a novel coronavirus because it had not been identified before and is considered to be a new strain. It does not have the same features as the usual coronaviruses like the common cold that regularly affect human beings. Coronaviruses are zoonotic, which means they are transferred between animals and people. (All information sourced from: CDC 2020; World Health Organization 2020; Australian Department of Health 2020) <SEP> What is coronavirus? <EOS>
Health care facilities, including those that diagnose and care for tuberculosis (TB) and lung diseases, are bound to receive patients with COVID-19, many of whom may be undiagnosed. Additional measures may be needed to avoid that staff in these centres are exposed to
    COVID-19 infection.The Information Note includes additional, temporary measures that should be considered. These include alternative arrangements to reduce visits for TB follow-up, precautions for sputum collection, transportation and testing. The note also includes a description of ethical obligations in this setting.Existing WHO recommendations for infection prevention and control for TB and for COVID-19 should be strictly implemented, including personal protection equipment. Lessons learnt over many years of TB infection prevention and control, contact tracing, investigation
    and management can benefit efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19. <SEP> What measures should be in place to protect staff working in tuberculosis laboratories and healthcare facilities, and community health workers, from COVID-19 infection? <EOS>
 COVID-19 has been shown to spread between people. Someone who is actively sick with COVID-19 can spread the illness to others, so CDC recommends these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on the severity of their illness) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others. Human coronaviruses typically spread through the air by coughing and sneezing. How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with doctors, infection prevention and control experts, and public health officials and involves considering specifics of each situation, including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and results of laboratory testing for that patient. 
	Current CDC guidance for when it is OK to release someone from isolation is made on a case by case basis and includes meeting all of the following requirements:
The patient is free from fever without the use of fever-reducing medications for at least 24 hours.
The patient is no longer showing symptoms, including cough.
It has been at least 10 days since the onset of the patient’s illness.
This recommendation is to help prevent most, but may not prevent all, instances of secondary spread.  According to CDC, the risk of transmission after recovery is likely very substantially less than that during illness.
Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of infection to others. <SEP>  How does COVID-19 spread? <EOS>
 At this time, APHIS’ Agriculture Select Agent Services (AgSAS) will not be conducting routine inspections. We do have the ability to extend registration validity to ensure that all facilities are authorized to possess, use or transfer select agents. Should a compliance issue arise, we have the ability to conduct the necessary follow up, including an inspection. <SEP>  Will APHIS continue to ensure compliance of facilities handling select agents to ensure proper storage and maintenance? <EOS>
The New York City Department  of Education (DOE) has moved to remote learning at this time. The physical  school locations will be closed for the rest of the school year.
Each school has its  own online platform, with many schools using Google Classroom.

One way we maintain a safe environment for our patients and caregivers is by requiring patients to undergo COVID-19 testing within three days prior to any surgery or procedure in a Cleveland Clinic operating room, ambulatory surgery center and select locations.
Recently published data in The Lancet supports our pre-operative testing requirement. The study found that asymptomatic patients with COVID-19 were at higher risk of post-operative complications. By requiring patients to complete pre-operative testing, we help protect our patients and caregivers. <SEP> I have a scheduled surgery or procedure and was told I need a COVID-19 test before my appointment.

No. Public transit (including paratransit) is open to everyone to ride for any purpose.
As more people go back to work and people start doing more activities outside the home, buses, trains, and other
    transit vehicles may have more riders. Therefore, the County has a Mandatory
        Directive for Public Transit
    to make sure people can ride public transportation safely. The Directive requires you to do things like wear a face
    coverings and maintain 6-foot social distancing from everyone outside your household whenever you are waiting at a
    stop or riding on public transit, and requires public transit agencies to do things like make hand sanitizer
    available on board and clean transit vehicles more often. Please read the Directive for additional information.
If you don’t have a car, you can also use ride-share/on-demand car services (like Uber and Lyft) or taxis. If safe to
    do so and weather permits, keep the windows open while using any of these services to increase airflow. Keep in mind
    that you should avoid as much as possible being in close quarters in a vehicle that has been used by lots of other
    people. <SEP> Are there any limits on who can use public transit? <EOS>
If a worker claims to be exempt from face covering requirements, businesses must follow the requirements of applicable laws (including civil rights laws like the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Minnesota Human Rights Act) that relate to verification of a worker's condition or disability. Because businesses have to maintain a safe workplace and ensure compliance with the Executive Order, a business should not allow a worker to work without a face covering without verifying that they need an exemption. Once the exemption is verified, the business should provide any exempt worker an accommodation, as long as it can keep the worker, other workers, and customers and visitors healthy and safe. 
A business’ COVID-19 Preparedness Plan must document the actions it puts in place to lessen or eliminate the risks of COVID-19 exposure posed by exempt workers and must put these measures into practice. Actions should be based on up-to-date public health recommendations. If the worker will interact with customers, visitors, or other workers (particularly when social distancing is not always possible), the employer could offer the worker the option of wearing a face shield as an alternative, if appropriate. If a worker also cannot medically tolerate a face shield, or if a face shield would not be appropriate under the circumstances (for example, in situations where wearing a face shield may be unsafe), the business must lessen or eliminate potential transmission risk in other ways. For example, the business could develop and implement a protocol to ensure that strict social distancing is maintained between customers and other workers for the worker’s entire shift. This may require changing the worker’s role (e.g., a worker who regularly interacts with customers and/or moves around in close proximity to others could be moved to a role that allows them to work alone in an office, or to a cashier role that allows social distancing to be maintained to the extent possible and the worker is behind a plexiglass or similar barrier whenever social distancing cannot be maintained). Overall, if the business cannot lessen the risks posed by an exempt worker through actions that follow public health recommendations, or if the exempt worker refuses offered accommodations, the business must send the worker home. <SEP> What should a business do when a worker claims to be exempt from the face covering mandate? <EOS>
Yes. Dog training on state land is permitted during the open season (July 8 – April 15), and field dog trials may resume, as long as people maintain six feet of distance from people outside their own household and the assemblage consists of no more than 100 people.

There are 21 records of falsified dexamethasone in the WHO Global Surveillance and Monitoring System database with the most recent one received from the Eastern Mediterranean in February 2020.It is expected that, following the high level of publicity given to the medicines, incidents of substandard and/or falsified dexamethasone products will occur. This is based on experience with reports of falsified chloroquine products when hydroxychloroquine was thought to be a potential treatment for COVID19Increased vigilance throughout all supply chains and due diligence in any procurement activities are essential. Member States and regulatory authorities are encouraged to promptly report any incidents of substandard or falsified dexamethasone to the WHO global surveillance and monitoring system. <SEP> What are the risks of Substandard or Falsified (SF) products? <EOS>
Some promising studies are showing that almost every person infected makes antibodies, which is a good thing. But are these antibodies able to be used as a treatment? There are a number of studies that are getting started around the country, including at Johns Hopkins. If they're successful, that's a very good sign for the vaccines, because it shows that antibodies help.
There are also companies that are making specific antibodies. I had a conversation this week with someone who's closely tracking the pipeline. The first set of potentially significant advancements may be these antibody-type therapies.
There is also solid safety data now on antibody therapy. Whether it works will be better known in a couple months. (Dr. Josh Sharfstein, 5/19/20) <SEP> What progress is being made on therapies or treatments for COVID-19? <EOS>
Protection measures for everyone
Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority. Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.
You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:

☑ Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.
☑ Maintain at least 1 meter (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing. Why? When someone coughs or sneezes, they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.
☑ Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.
☑ Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately. Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene, you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.
☑ Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.
									Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.
☑ Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places – especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease. Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas. <SEP> What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease? <EOS>

No, measuring employees’ temperatures using a thermometer or thermal scanner is not required. Screening employees for
    temperature and symptoms means that employees should be asked before starting work if they feel or recently felt
    feverish, and have or recently had other symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, chills, and
    muscle/body aches. This screening process is required. (Note: Temperature screenings with a thermometer or thermal
    scanner can increase COVID-19 risk if many employees convene in the same place for screening. If an employer chooses
    to use a thermometer or thermal scanner to measure employees’ temperatures, they should send home any employees
    whose temperatures measure 99 degrees Fahrenheit or higher.) <SEP> The Social Distancing Protocol requires employers to conduct temperature and symptom screenings for employees
        at the beginning of their shifts. Do the temperature screenings require a temperature check with a thermometer

Properly prepared cooked food is unlikely to get you sick with COVID-19. Although there could be some risk from the person-to-person interaction of picking up food or getting delivery, this might still be lower than going to a grocery store when it is very crowded. Either way, wash your hands before you eat.
Preliminary information suggests that SARS-CoV-2 (like other coronaviruses) can last for up to several days on surfaces, depending on the type of surface and environmental conditions. Surfaces can be cleaned with alcohol- or bleach-based disinfectants.

Make sure your child has plenty of masks
               or face coverings that fit well and are comfortable. They should fit snugly, cover
               the nose and mouth, have 2–3 layers, not have valves, and be washable or disposable.
Put your child's name on the masks with permanent marker.
Remind your child that masks are not toys and are not for trading.
Make a plan for the mask when your child eats lunch. Check if the school has a
               plan. Options might include:
               
Putting the mask in a paper bag. A plastic bag is OK if your child doesn't have
               a paper bag.
For older kids, hanging the mask on a lanyard, string, or chain around their neck.
               Younger kids should not hang masks from a string around the neck.
If kids eat in their classrooms, schools might put hooks on the desks for hanging
               masks during lunch.

​It depends. Under the FFCRA, paid sick leave and expanded family and medical leave include leave to care for one (or more) of your children when his or her school or place of care is closed or childcare provider is unavailable, due to COVID-19 related reasons. This leave may only be taken to care for a child without a disability if they are under the age of 18. If your child is 18 years of age or older with a disability and cannot care for himself/herself due to that disability, you may take paid sick leave and expanded family and medical leave to care for the child if the school or place of care is closed or if the childcare provider is unavailable, due to COVID-19 related reasons, and you are unable to work or telework as a result.In addition, paid sick leave is available to care for an individual who is subject to a federal, state, or local quarantine or isolation order related to COVID-19 or has been advised by a health care provider to self-quarantine due to concerns related to COVID-19. If you have a need to care for your child age 18 or older who needs care for these circumstances, you may take paid sick leave if you are unable to work or telework as a result of providing care. But in no event may your total paid sick leave exceed two weeks. <SEP> ​May I take paid sick leave or expanded family and medical leave to care for my child who is 18 years old or older? <EOS>
Educate your clients on the differences between the enteric coronaviruses that circulate in domestic animals, and for which we can vaccinate, and this novel coronavirus, which, though it shares the same common name (“coronavirus”), is actually quite different.
There is no evidence that animals play a significant role in the transmission of SAR-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
Do not wipe or bathe your pet with chemical disinfectants, alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or any other products not approved for animal use.
Routine testing of animals for COVID-19 is not recommended by the CDC, USDA, or AVMA at this time.
People diagnosed with COVID-19 should have a different member of the household care for any mammalian pets in the home, if possible. The ill owner/household member should avoid contact with the pet as with other household members, including avoiding petting, snuggling, being kissed or licked and sharing food. If the ill individual must care for the pet, they should wash their hands before and after interacting with the pet and wear a facemask if one is available when interacting with their animals.
If an animal needs veterinary care and a person in that pet’s household has been ill with COVID-19, encourage clients to inform the veterinary team of the COVID-19 exposure.
Every effort should be made to allow companion animals to continue to shelter in place at home with their families during the COVID-19 outbreak. <SEP> What messages should I share with my clients about COVID-19? <EOS>

If you have been around someone who is sick with COVID-19, local authorities, the health department, or your doctor may recommend that you get tested for COVID-19. The health department may be able to provide resources for testing in your area.

While you are waiting for your COVID-19 test result, stay home away from others (self-quarantine) and monitor your health for symptoms of COVID-19 to protect your friends, family, and others from possibly getting COVID-19.
If your test is positive, you should continue to stay home and self-isolate away from others and monitor your health. If you have symptoms of COVID-19 and they worsen or become severe, you should seek emergency medical care. Severe symptoms include trouble breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, inability to wake or stay awake, or bluish lips or face. Someone from the health department may call you to

Check on your health,
Discuss who you have been around, and
Ask where you have spent time while you may have been able to spread COVID-19 to others.


If your test is negative and you don’t have symptoms, you should continue to stay home and self-quarantine away from others for 14 days after your last exposure to COVID-19 and follow all recommendations from the health department. This is important because symptoms can appear up to 14 days after you’ve been exposed and are infected. A negative result before the end of your quarantine period does not rule out possible infection. Additionally, you do not need a repeat test unless you develop symptoms, or if you require a test to return to work.
If your test is negative and you have symptoms, you should continue to self-quarantine away from others for 14 days after your last exposure to COVID-19 and follow all recommendations from the health department. Additional medical consultation and a second test may be needed if your symptoms do not improve. <SEP> If I am a close contact, will I be tested for COVID-19? <EOS>
For  now, no Housing Court cases can proceed if the tenant does not have a lawyer.
HRA's Office of Civil Justice will work with  City-funded legal services providers and the courts to assign attorneys to  unrepresented tenants who go to court because they have received a warrant of  eviction. 
If you need rental assistance, you can also apply  for help from HRA. In most cases, the entire process can be done without going  in person to the HRA office. Visit Access HRA to submit your applications for emergency rental assistance and other benefits. 
For  more information, you can call 311 and ask for the Tenant Helpline to learn about the latest updates  and get connected with legal help. <SEP> I don't have a lawyer to help me with my Housing Court case. How can I  get help? <EOS>
Wildfire smoke is a complex mixture of air pollutants that are harmful to humans. The relationship between wildfire smoke and COVID-19 has not yet been studied, but research suggests that exposure to smoke could increase the risk and severity of respiratory infections similar to COVID-19.

Exposure to air pollutants in wildfire smoke can irritate the lungs, cause inflammation, alter immune function, and increase susceptibility to respiratory infections, possibly including COVID-19.
In addition to potentially making firefighters more vulnerable to getting COVID-19, inflammation in the respiratory tract due to wildfire smoke might also increase the risk of developing more severe outcomes for those with COVID-19.
Some of the symptoms of COVID-19 and smoke exposure overlap. Respiratory symptoms such as cough, sore throat, and shortness of breath and difficulty breathing are symptoms of both COVID-19 and smoke exposure. If a worker is experiencing symptoms of COVID-19, they should contact a healthcare provider and follow CDC guidance on What To Do If You Are Sick.

Firefighters should consider and select tactics that safely reduce their exposure to smoke while meeting operational objectives. COVID-19 is an additional risk to consider when assessing all risks and hazards in the wildfire environment. Firefighters cannot completely eliminate their risk for exposure to smoke and the SARS-CoV-2 virus, but they can reduce this risk. <SEP> What about exposure to wildfire smoke and COVID-19? <EOS>
This is a hard question to answer. Different phases of reopening target different businesses — retail stores, restaurants and bars, salons and barber shops, houses of worship, gyms, etc. 
The increasing moves to lift restrictions — or at least to open up outdoor spaces like beaches and state parks — reflect the immense political and societal pressures weighing on the nation’s governors, even as epidemiologists remain cautious and warn of a second wave of cases.
In general, think of businesses in terms of temptation. Where are people going to feel most at ease, and where will they most want to get close to one another and remove their masks? At a store, you can sort of get in and get out. 
But at businesses that exist for socialization, it’s a lot harder. Bars can be loud, and alcohol is flowing. Gyms are inherently germy, and working out in a mask is hard. Outdoor dining in restaurants seems feasible, but can be tricky: Tables are close, you’re eating so you cannot keep your mask on, and waiters keep dropping by to check up on you. 
Consider your comfort level with visiting a particular business before you head out. There may be ways to ease your anxieties, such as calling in advance to ask about crowds or cleaning procedures. <SEP> What businesses are safe to frequent? <EOS>
That depends. Questions about the morality of traveling are not new. For years, people have raised concerns about climate change and traveling to countries with oppressive governments. Certain travel activities, like elephant riding, also raise eyebrows.
On the one hand, the economy of many vacation destinations, like the Caribbean, often depend on tourism. And cheap flights are tempting. But many countries have been spared outbreaks, and have much weaker health systems than we do. As with everything these days, assess the risks. <SEP> Flights to some tourist destinations are cheap. But is it ethical? <EOS>
COVID-19 case and death counts are updated daily on the COVID-19 dashboard.
Although most of the cases will be mild or moderate, the infection can cause serious illness and there is a potential for many people to become ill at the same time, overwhelming our healthcare system. If that happens, people requiring care may not be able to get it when they need it. Every King County resident has a responsibility to each other to make sure our community collectively lessens the impact of this disease.
Anyone who is sick should stay home. Anyone who develops symptoms of COVID-19, as well as their close contacts, should follow Public Health guidance addressing what to do if you have confirmed or suspected COVID-19 or are worried that you do.
Washington is conducting a county-by-county based Safe Start reopening plan for resuming recreational, social and business activities. King County is currently in Phase 2. <SEP> 22. What is the current situation in Washington and King County? <EOS>
You would need to gently say, "Hey, for now we need to avoid touching our face because of the disease, so let's touch something else, okay? You can touch your necklace if you'd like."

To apply, fill out the Healthcare Professional Call to Serve online form.
Out-Of-State Health Care Professionals
If you are an out-of-state health care professional who wishes to volunteer in New Jersey, you may be eligible for a temporary license.
In response to the on-going COVID-19 state of emergency, the State of New Jersey has waived certain regulatory provisions regarding licensure of health care practitioners through reciprocity. These waivers will allow health care providers licensed in other states to obtain New Jersey temporary licensure and provide services to New Jersey patients either through telemedicine, or in-person.
Learn more about the program and apply online through the New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs.
Note: Any temporary emergency out-of-state license approved on June 1, 2020, or beyond, will be valid through November 30, 2020. These licenses shall expire after that date, unless the Division determines to extend the license duration at that time.
Foreign-Licensed Physicians
As part of the state's ongoing effort to combat COVID-19, physicians who are licensed in another country but living in the United States can now apply for a temporary emergency license to practice medicine in New Jersey---the first program of its kind in the country.
The program is open to individuals living and authorized to work in the U.S. who are currently licensed, in good standing, to practice medicine in another country. Among other criteria, eligible candidates must:

Have engaged in the clinical practice of medicine for at least five years;
Have not been out of practice for more than five years;
Have no disciplinary or criminal histories that preclude them from the program; and
Provide copies of relevant documents to support their application, including their medical license, and information about their education and professional experience.

Physicians licensed under this program will be required to limit their practice of medicine in New Jersey to providing in-person medical care at facilities licensed by the New Jersey Department of Health (DOH) or at another location designated as an emergency health care center by the Commissioner of Health.
The temporary emergency licenses granted under the program will not extend beyond the current public health emergency.
Qualified foreign-licensed doctors can apply online for temporary emergency licensure through the New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs.
For more information about the program, the Division has created a Frequently Asked Questions document.
Recent Graduates Of Health Care Programs
The Division of Consumer Affairs has created a program to grant temporary emergency licenses to recent graduates of certain health care programs who have not yet been able to take and pass their licensing exams.
The emergency graduate licensure program is open to individuals applying for licensure within six months of graduating from the following programs:

Accredited registered professional nursing (RN);
Practical nursing (LPN);
Physician assistant;
Pharmacy education and training located in New Jersey; and
Accredited respiratory care therapy education and training located in any state.

Individuals will not be eligible for the emergency graduate licensure program if they have failed the relevant licensing examination and will be dropped from the program if they fail the exam after receiving an emergency graduate license.
With the exception of respiratory care therapists, graduates licensed through this program will be eligible to work only under supervision in an acute care facility licensed by the New Jersey Department of Health. Respiratory care specialists will also be authorized to work under supervision in field hospitals.
The program will end automatically at the conclusion of the COVID-19 state of emergency and public health emergency.
Graduates can apply online for a temporary emergency graduate license through the New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs.
For more information, the Division has created a Frequently Asked Questions resource.

Current research links COVID-19 to certain types of bat as the original source, but does not exclude the involvement of other animals. Several types of coronaviruses can infect animals and can be transmitted to other animals and people. There is no evidence that companion animals (e.g. dogs or cats) pose a risk of infection to humans, however there have been reports of pet dogs and pet cats that have had positive swabs. It appears likely that they were infected by their owners or some other person who had COVID-19.

Yes, children can get the novel coronavirus, known as COVID-19. While we are still learning a lot about how the virus works and who it affects, as of March 2020, the CDC says that “children do not appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19 than adults.” So far, it has been adults who make up most of the cases but it is still too early to be certain whether or not children are as susceptible to the more severe impacts of the virus. Prevention is your best friend, so wash your hands regularly, avoid close contact with sick people, cover your cough or sneeze, disinfect surfaces and things you touch a lot and don’t touch your face, eyes, mouth and nose unless you have clean hands.

The Defence Team’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic follows four phases: 

Phase 1 – Pandemic Preparedness. This phase consisted of mitigation, planning and monitoring of the world wide pandemic; 
Phase 2 – Pandemic Alert. This phase was activated by the CDS and consisted of active monitoring of the evolving pandemic threat at home and abroad with some protective/preventative measures being adopted;  
Phase 3 – Pandemic Response (Ongoing). On 13 March 2020, the CDS activated this phase which is characterized by widespread and sustained transmission of a virus within the general population. The Defence Team instituted Business Continuity Plans (BCP) to preserve critical capabilities to both enable the continued execution of domestic and international operations, and to enable the execution of operations in support of the GC COVID-19 response. It is anticipated that DND/CAF will remain in this phase for an extended period. The purpose of the CDS/DM Directive For the Resumption of Activities is to define execution of additional limited Defence Team activities during Phase 3 – Pandemic Response. This will happen via a series of four stages as outlined in A5; and 
Phase 4 – Post Pandemic Restoration. The restoration phase begins when post-pandemic status has been confirmed. This phase involves the resumption and re-establishment of all DND/CAF services and operations to normal levels, conditions permitting, and will be the subject of a subsequent directive. <SEP> What are the four phases of the Defence Team’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic? <EOS>

People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick. <SEP> How does COVID-19 spread? <EOS>

Everyone is at risk if they are exposed to  COVID-19. However, older adults and people with underlying medical conditions are at increased risk for severe illness.
Older Adults
Among adults, the risk for severe illness from COVID-19 increases with age. As you get older, your risk for severe illness from COVID-19 increases. For example, people in their 50s are at higher risk for severe illness than people in their 40s. Similarly, people in their 60s or 70s are, in general, at higher risk for severe illness than people in their 50s. The greatest risk for severe illness from COVID-19 is among those aged 85 or older.
People with Underlying Medical Conditions
People of any age with certain underlying medical conditions are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. These include:

Cancer
Chronic kidney disease
COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)
Immunocompromised state (weakened immune system) from solid organ transplant
Obesity (body mass index [BMI] of 30 or higher)
Serious heart conditions, such as heart failure, coronary artery disease, or cardiomyopathies
Sickle cell disease
Type 2 diabetes mellitus

Children who have medical complexity, who have neurologic, genetic, metabolic conditions, or who have congenital heart disease might be at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 compared to other children.
Based on what is known at this time, people with the following conditions might be at an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19:

Asthma (moderate-to-severe)
Cerebrovascular disease (affects blood vessels and blood supply to the brain)
Cystic fibrosis
Hypertension or high blood pressure
Immunocompromised state (weakened immune system) from blood or bone marrow transplant, immune deficiencies, HIV, use of corticosteroids, or use of other immune weakening medicines
Neurologic conditions, such as dementia
Liver disease
Pregnancy
Pulmonary fibrosis (having damaged or scarred lung tissues)
Smoking
Thalassemia (a type of blood disorder)
Type 1 diabetes mellitus

In the first instance, cities can facilitate the shift to online learning by working with schools, businesses, and nonprofits to ensure that every student has safe and regular access to the internet from home. Cities can also help provide forums and tools for teachers to share curriculum and lesson-planning ideas, and develop tools to assist parents and caregivers. 
Supporting remote learning is just one part of the education leadership that mayors can offer at this time, however. You can use your position to convene a children's cabinet or council to coordinate cross-boundary efforts to make sure students in your city are safe, healthy, well-fed, able to access mental and behavioral healthcare, and generally prepared to learn online or otherwise. 
Below are a few examples of what cities around the US are doing to help educators, caregivers, and students.
Wichita is providing online professional development for teachers every hour on the hour on how to provide blended learning. 
Orange County has developed a Parent Academy to train parents and caregivers to assist in providing high-quality education and assistance to students.  
Tacoma, Washington is hosting live weekly webinar series on topics including "Engaging Learners Online" and "Supporting Youth With Disabilities." 
Somerville, Massachusetts, has created a website with an Early Education Remote Learning Plan that includes links to learning resources. 
The By All Means initiative at Harvard's Graduate School of Education reports the following approaches from some of its partner cities:
In Louisville, KY, the district’s Teaching and Learning team developed an online portal for students and teachers to engage in remote learning. It also distributed instructional packets that students can complete without a digital device.  
In Oakland, CA, the school district has worked to promote equity by building a strong infrastructure to support online learning. Students have electronic devices and access to broadband connectivity. In addition, each school provides at-home learning plans to guide instruction.
In Chattanooga-Hamilton-County in TN, the school district is bolstering students’ learning opportunities by partnering with the local PBS station to offer educational programming. In addition, Chattanooga 2.0, a backbone organization supporting its "Children's Cabinet," launched a communications campaign to address the digital divide affecting many children and families in the community and has worked with businesses to purchase tech and secure free/low-cost internet access for all students.
Providence, RI, is tackling the digital divide through the state’s partnership with internet providers and cell phone carriers, which are offering unlimited data plans and free internet service for a period of time. (Lynne Sacks, 4/30/20) <SEP> What can cities do to support teachers transitioning to an online learning format and parents transitioning to homeschooling for the first time? <EOS>

Contact your doctor if you have symptoms and want to be tested for COVID-19. Testing may be available at your doctor’s office, urgent care center, pharmacy, or other healthcare clinic. Some testing sites in Virginia are offering community testing events, such as drive-thru testing.
To find testing sites in your area, visit the website Virginia COVID-19 Testing Sites. This site is updated frequently. Each site has different policies and procedures for testing and billing. Please reach out to the individual site for information about testing availability.
Testing capacity at commercial, private, and hospital laboratories performing SARS-CoV-2 testing continues to increase in Virginia. <SEP> Where can I get tested for COVID-19? <EOS>
We are entering a very unhappy, uncharted territory moving forward with opening up. We should not view it as binary, and avoid thinking in terms of camps? The move forward has to be done slowly, but it has to begin. You’re not going to be able to hold off the politics at this stage.
Two points to make in terms of those communications. You need to remind your teams that closing down was actually the easy part: “You thought that was hard, but this is going to be harder because you're going to be pivoting in real-time.”
This idea of “normal” is something that we just have to get out of our heads. I want to be optimistic, but we don't know what will happen, so we really do need think about it as the “now” normal— every day will be different. So, in terms of planning, constantly remind the public that decisions will be reevaluated as scientific data comes in, the default is still social distancing, and that the public has a role in this by safe behavior and mask wearing.

Testing everyone all the time is unrealistic. Other countries have controlled the virus through a combination of broad testing of at-risk groups and vigorous follow-up of positive cases. The CDC continually updates its guidelines on testing. The current recommendation is to prioritize hospitalized patients, healthcare workers, hospital staff, workers in congregate living settings, and first responders who exhibit symptoms.

Enquires from military personnel on international travel or general allowance claims should be directed to the Director, Compensation Benefits and Administration (DCBA). For additional information on general allowance claims, please visit the Military Personnel Command website. <SEP> I am posted OUTCAN. We have been directed to avoid public transportation due to the risk of COVID-19. Because of where we are posted my colleagues and I do not have PMV, and public transportation is our normal method of commuting. We have been directed to take taxi to/from work and to submit claims for the cost. However, this direction has been questioned as normally the crown does not pay an employee to travel to work. However, we pay a share of the cost of a yearly transit pass (based on the cost of OC Transpo) and the crown pays the remainder. So, the cost of our commute is partly covered by the Crown. We do not receive Commuting Assistance. If we take taxi to work, in lieu of the normal public transport, will these claims be supported? And, would gratuities be included in the claim? <EOS>

Group Contract Terminates. If your employer went out of business, you will not be able to get COBRA or continuation coverage. You will need individual coverage. The NY State of Health: The Official Health Plan Marketplace has several options for coverage, which could provide you with lower-cost or no-cost coverage depending on your income. You also have the right to buy individual coverage through the insurer that provided your group coverage, known as a “conversion” policy.

WHO developed its rapid guidance based on the consensus of international experts who considered the currently available evidence on the modes of transmission of 2019-nCoV. This evidence demonstrates viral transmission by droplets and contact with contaminated
    surfaces of equipment; it does not support routine airborne transmission. Airborne transmission may happen, as has been shown with other viral respiratory diseases, during aerosol-generating procedures (e.g., tracheal intubation, bronchoscopy), thus
    WHO recommends airborne precautions for these procedures.

               sure to:

Keep 6 feet apart from people you don't live with (called physical or social
               distancing).
Wear a face covering or mask when out

Use their imaginations and tell stories. To explain why social distancing is important, one mother in Los Angeles compared it to pulling to the side of the road to let an ambulance pass. 
You could also try to make it into a game. (Think hot potato, but people.) You win points if you’re far away.
Debates about using rewards to motivate children are endless, but parents trade favors for obedience all the time. Even the C.D.C. signs off on rewarding good behavior (say, wearing a mask outside without fussing) with  praise, a board game or an extra book at bedtime. 
Don’t threaten them, though. Child psychology experts say that threats hurt motivation and undermine parent-child relationships. But you can still take away privileges for not following the rules (like wandering too close to strangers without a mask). Just make sure you explain the consequences beforehand and make the punishment fit the infraction, psychologists say. <SEP> How do I explain social distancing to my kids? <EOS>
After exiting the structure, place items that were likely exposed to body fluids (e.g., blood, saliva, feces) in biohazard bags or waste containers and follow state and local guidelines for disposal of this waste.

School districts and colleges/universities will be allowed to hold modified in-person graduation ceremonies beginning on July 6.
The New Jersey Department of Education (NJDOE) has published graduation guidance for school districts and the Office of the Secretary of Higher Education (OSHE) has published graduation guidance for institutions of higher education that outline considerations for modified in-person graduation ceremonies beginning on July 6. Both include requirements that ceremonies be held outdoors, adhere to social distancing protocols, and restrict capacity to protect the health and safety of students and families celebrating these milestones amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
School districts and institutions of higher education that plan to hold modified in-person ceremonies must certify to NJDOE or to OSHE that the planned ceremony will comply with applicable requirements for gatherings, including those addressing social distancing.
The DOE Graduation Certification Form for school districts is available here.
The OSHE Graduation Certification Form for institutions of higher education is available here.

PPE is in short supply across the country. Many medical providers do not have access to sufficient PPE, and US reserves are depleting. However, President Trump recently signed the Defense Production Act, which will allow the federal government to direct additional production of PPE and other essential equipment and supplies to fulfill the needs of healthcare providers.
In the short-term, cities can take the following steps to prevent shortages in PPE:
Encourage citizens to donate healthcare-grade PPE: N95 masks and other supplies are in extremely short supply and can do much more to prevent the spread of the virus in the hands of healthcare workers, who expose themselves to the virus on a daily basis.
Encourage citizens to buy or create cloth masks: In lieu of using healthcare-grade masks and PPE, citizens can purchase or create materials such as cloth-based masks that provide some protection (but are not sufficient for healthcare providers). U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams demonstrates how to create such a mask in this video. The CDC also provides detailed information on how to wear and create cloth face coverings.
Follow CDC guidance on optimizing the supply of facemasks: The CDC has issued the following guidance on how public health officials can maximize their supplies of face masks. Strategies include: limited reuse of masks, excluding healthcare providers at higher risk from COVID-19, and more. (Juliette Kayyem, 4/8/20) <SEP> What are communities doing to ensure first responders and healthcare workers have personal protective equipment (PPE)? <EOS>
No. Only List N disinfectants approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencyexternal icon should be used to disinfect surfaces (such as handrails and in bathrooms) and shared objects (such as kickboards and pool noodles).
The list includes hundreds of disinfectants. Operators of public pools, hot tubs, or water playgrounds (such as at an apartment complex or owned by a community) should consult with the design company or engineer to determine which disinfectants are best suited for surfaces and with manufacturers to determine which disinfectants are best suited for shared objects.
Remember to clean surfaces and shared objects before disinfecting them and to follow directions on labels of cleaning products and disinfectants. <SEP> Can I use pool, hot tub, or water playground water to disinfect surfaces or shared objects? <EOS>
If it has been less than 7 days since the sick employee used the facility, clean and disinfect all areas used by the sick employee following the CDC cleaning and disinfection recommendations.
If it has been 7 days or more since the sick employee used the facility, additional cleaning and disinfection is not necessary. Continue routinely cleaning and disinfecting all high-touch surfaces in the facility.
Other employees may have been exposed to the virus if they were in “close contact” (within approximately 6 feet) of the sick employee for a prolonged period of time.

If an employee is confirmed to have COVID-19, employers should inform fellow employees of their possible exposure to COVID-19 in the workplace but maintain confidentiality as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).
Those who have symptoms should self-isolate and follow CDC recommended steps.
In most workplaces, those potentially exposed but with no symptoms should remain at home or in a comparable setting and practice social distancing for 14 days.
Critical infrastructure employees should follow Implementing Safety Practices for Critical Infrastructure Employees Who May Have Had Exposure to a Person with Suspected or Confirmed COVID-19. A critical infrastructure employee who is symptom-free and returns to work should wear a cloth face covering at all times while in the workplace for 14 days after last exposure. Employers can issue cloth face coverings or can approve employees’ supplied cloth face coverings in the event of shortages.


Employees not considered exposed should self-monitor for symptoms. If they develop symptoms, they should notify their supervisor and stay home. <SEP> What should I do if I find out several days later, after an employee worked, that they were diagnosed with COVID-19? <EOS>
If you choose to wear a mask:Before touching the mask, clean hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and waterTake the mask and inspect it for tears or holes.Orient which side is the top side (where the metal strip is).Ensure the proper side of the mask faces outwards (the coloured side).Place the mask to your face. Pinch the metal strip or stiff edge of the mask so it moulds to the shape of your nose.Pull down the mask’s bottom so it covers your mouth and your chin.Do not touch the mask while you are wearing it for protection.After use, take off the mask with clean hands; remove the elastic loops from behind the ears while keeping the mask away from your face and clothes, to avoid touching potentially contaminated surfaces of the mask. Discard the mask in a closed bin immediately after use. Do not reuse the mask.Perform hand hygiene after touching or discarding the mask – Use alcohol-based hand rub or, if visibly soiled, wash your hands with soap and water.Be aware that there is a global shortage of medical masks (both surgical masks and N95 masks). These should be reserved as much as possible for health care workers. Remember that  masks are not a substitute for other, more effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 such as frequently washing your hands, covering your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter from others.

Children should be kept together with their parents or caregivers wherever possible. Children with mild or moderate disease can be considered for home care if the home setting is suitable for the isolation and care of a COVID-19 patient, if they are not obese, do not smoke, and do not have other conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease, cancer, chronic kidney disease, or immunosuppression.Caregivers of children with COVID-19 should monitor for signs and symptoms of clinical deterioration requiring urgent re-evaluation. These include difficulty breathing/fast or shallow breathing (for infants: grunting, inability to breastfeed), blue lips or face, chest pain or pressure, new confusion, inability to awaken/not interacting when awake, inability to drink or keep down any liquids. If caregivers are suspected or have confirmed COVID-19 infection, medical and non-medical factors must be taken into account due to the negative and possible long-term consequences of even a short period of family separation.Community protection focal points and caseworkers should help families plan–in advance–agreements for the care of children in case the caregiver becomes ill.  Children living with primary caregivers who are elderly, disabled or have underlying health conditions should be prioritized. <SEP> Can children be cared for at home if they have COVID-19? <EOS>
For anyone who attended a large gathering, including a protest, and didn’t keep at least six feet of physical distance the single best thing you can do is to stay home and away from others for 14 days. That is the time period in which it can take to develop symptoms of COVID-19.
Anyone who develops symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, whether they’ve been to a protest or not, should get a test. Those symptoms include: cough, fever, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, chills, headache, sore throat, or a new loss of taste or smell.
If you attended a protest and want to get a test, go ahead and do so. And remember, if you do that and you get a negative test, it doesn’t mean that you are not infected because it can take up to 14 days to show symptoms and to test positive.

Your information is confidential. Your name will not be released to your contacts or your COVID-19 status – that information will only be known to public health officials and our local health department partners, if needed.
If you test positive for COVID-19, a contact tracer will work with you to list all the people who were within six feet of you for more than 10 minutes starting two days before you first had symptoms. If you don't have symptoms, we'll ask about your activity during the two days before your diagnosis.
We will also ask for the phone numbers of anyone you tell us about so they can be called and cared for. That information is used ONLY for the purpose of helping those people to get tested or to quarantine.
We will encourage you to let your contacts know about your illness, and we will call your contacts to let them know they have been exposed and what steps they should take to protect themselves and their loved ones. But again, we will not tell them your name only that they may have been in close contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19.
How Is My Data Stored and Protected?
We take your privacy seriously and strictly adhere to four key principles when it comes to protecting you and your data:

Consent: We only collect information about your contacts that you provide us.
Transparency: We will be clear on how the information you provide us is being used. In this case, we are only using the names and phone numbers you provide for the purpose of helping those people get tested or self-quarantine, if needed.
Security: We are taking every security precaution we can to protect your personal data and prevent it from being shared unnecessarily or leaked.
Limits: We have placed strict limits on the contact tracing program – we collect limited data (only what is needed to keep you and your close contacts safe), use it for limited purposes (stop the spread of COVID-19), and limit who it is shared with (public health officials and our local partners).

In keeping with our principles, we wanted to let you know we are working with Dimagi to deploy their open source CommCare platform across the State to ensure we centralize the State's contact tracing efforts.
Collecting information in a uniform way makes it easier for health officials to share information and to track the virus across New Jersey. When time is of the essence, we cannot lose any of it trying to work across different platforms. It will also ensure connectivity with contact tracers with our neighbors, including New York State and Philadelphia.
The CommCare platform is fully HIPAA-compliant to protect your privacy and utilizes the strongest, state-of-the-art industry-standard encryption to protect your data during collection, processing, and storage.
No one outside of our contact-tracing program will have access to CommCare, and all information is off-loaded after 45 days to the state's epidemiological database.
This platform is not the same thing as "exposure notification" or "digital alerting tools," consumer apps like those made by Google and Apple that offer a way for the public to track if they have come into contact with a person who has tested positive and also entered that information into their own phone.
It's also important to underscore that your information remains confidential. Your name will not be released to your contacts or your COVID-19 status –- and the information you share will not be used for the purposes of law enforcement or immigration enforcement in any way. In addition, it will not negatively affect your public charge assessment or be used to deny access to health care or any other essential service.

It's important to meet people's basic needs because that will help them stay safe. Making sure people have food or know where to pick it up or whether it can be delivered for free or for a reduced fee is critical. (Dr. Lisa Cooper, 5/7/20)
In Baltimore, one food distribution site had about 20 percent Latino immigrants as clients.

Q: What do U.S. exporters of FDA-regulated food products need to consider related to COVID-19? 
U.S. exporters of FDA-regulated food products are responsible for following U.S. laws and regulations and following the requirements of the countries to which they export. Recently, some countries have begun to request commitments to provide information that food is free of the COVID-19 virus and/or has been produced under conditions that prevent contamination by the COVID-19 virus. At this time, there is no evidence of transmission of the COVID-19 virus, a respiratory virus, through food or food packaging, and the FDA does not anticipate that food products would need to be recalled or be withdrawn from the market because of COVID-19. Food facilities need to follow protocols set by local and state health departments, which may vary depending on the amount of community spread of COVID-19 in a given area. These decisions will be based on public health risk of person-to-person transmission – not based on food safety. FDA food safety requirements are robust and ensure that food produced for both domestic consumption and export is safe. The FDA is also communicating its understanding of the science related to COVID-19 transmission and food safety to foreign governments.
U.S. food exporters need to carefully consider and distinguish official food safety requirements of the importing countries and those conditions being requested in the context of a business-to-business relationship. Differentiating this will assist exporters in understanding their business options. Exporters are welcome to use existing FDA communications posted on its website to assist with their interactions with countries to which they export, if helpful. <SEP> Import/Export <EOS>
Yes. CDC recommends several strategies for this. For instance, organizers can:

Limit attendance or seating capacity to allow for social distancing, or host smaller events in larger rooms.
Block off rows or sections of seating in order to space people at least 6 feet apart.
Use multiple entrances and exits and discourage crowded waiting areas.
Eliminate lines or queues if possible or encourage people to stay at least 6 feet apart by providing signs or other visual cues such as tape or chalk marks.
Provide physical guides, such as tape on floors or sidewalks and signs on walls, to ensure that individuals remain at least 6 feet apart in lines and at other times (such as guides for creating one-way routes).
Prioritize outdoor activities where social distancing can be maintained as much as possible.
Offer online attendance options in addition to in-person attendance to help reduce the number of attendees.
Consider limiting the number of people who occupy the restroom at one time to allow for social distancing.

In Phase 2, gatherings of more than 10 people in a single indoor space remains prohibited. In outdoor spaces, gatherings of more than 25 people are prohibited. These mass gathering limits include parades, fairs, festivals, auditoriums, stadiums, arenas, conference rooms and meeting halls.
The mass gathering limit does not apply to retail businesses, restaurants, personal care and grooming businesses, pools, child care, day camps and overnight camps. In these settings, there are other restrictions, such as 50% reduced occupancy or putting 6 feet of distance between each group at a restaurant, to ensure that there is not overcrowding.
	 
	The prohibition on mass gatherings does not include gatherings for health and safety, to look for and obtain goods and services, for work or for receiving governmental services. A mass gathering does not include normal operations at airports, bus and train stations or stops, medical facilities, libraries, shopping malls and shopping centers.

You should talk to your  supervisor about alternatives for restroom breaks along your driving route.
Your employer (not the shipper/receiver) is required to make sure you do not suffer adverse health effects that could result from lack of access to a toilet. OSHA has sanitation standards (29 CFR 1910.141, 29 CFR 1926.51, 29 CFR 1928.110, 29 CFR 1915.88, and 29 CFR 1917.127) intended to ensure that workers do not suffer adverse  health effects that can result if toilets are not sanitary and/or are not available  when needed. However, some of these standards may not apply to mobile crews, or  normally unattended work locations, so long as those locations have transportation immediately available to nearby toilet and sanitation facilities. <SEP> I work as a delivery driver.

Currently there is no evidence of food or food packaging being associated with transmission of COVID-19.
Facilities are required to use personnel practices that protect against contamination of food, food contact surfaces and packaging and to maintain clean and sanitized facilities and food contact surfaces. Although it is possible that the infected worker may have touched surfaces in your facility, FDA-regulated food manufacturers are required to follow Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMPs). Maintaining CGMPs in the facility should minimize the potential for surface contamination and eliminate contamination when it occurs. With the detection of the coronavirus in asymptomatic people and studies showing survival of coronavirus on surfaces for short periods of time, as an extra precaution, food facilities may want to consider a more frequent cleaning and sanitation schedule for high human contact surfaces. <SEP> If a worker in my food processing facility has tested positive for COVID-19, should I test the environment for the SARS-CoV-2 virus?

On Saturday, March 28, Governor Phil Murphy detailed two new initiatives that will assist health care organizations with expenses related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Governor announced a $140 million pre-payment to health care providers to support preparations related to COVID-19. Additionally, Governor Murphy announced that the New Jersey Health Care Facilities Financing Authority (NJHCFFA) has launched a $6 million emergency loan program to assist New Jersey's health care organizations during this time.
Pre-Payment to Health Care Providers
The pre-payment, which advances $67.3 million in Charity Care, $60.5 million in Graduate Medical Education, and $14.6 million for University Hospital, will support increasing capacity to meet the anticipated patient growth including workforce demands, supplies, and medications. The Charity Care and Graduate Medical Education funds will be an advance of remaining fiscal year 2020 budget allocations for those programs.
COVID-19 Aid Program
The COVID-19 Aid program is a $6 million loan program to offset some of the unforeseen expenses incurred by this pandemic. Loans will:

Have no application, initial or annual fees;
Be at an interest rate of 0%;
Be secured solely by federal and State grants and other financial aid received by the recipient health care organizations as a response to COVID-19, as well as grants from other private and public sources related to COVID-19 resilience (together "COVID-19 Aid") and anything acquired with the proceeds thereof.

Health care organizations that wish to apply can find a loan application and more program information on the New Jersey Health Care Facilities Financing Authority's COVID-19 Aid Emergency Loan resource page.
Decisions on the loan recipients will be made according to the priority and amounts set by a committee consisting of the New Jersey Commissioner of Health or her designee, the Executive Director of the Authority and the Authority's Director of Research, Investor Relations and Compliance. Additionally the loan will specify how the requested funds will be used: for instance, the acquisition of any property, or acquisition, construction or renovation of any building, acquisition of any equipment, including ventilators, acquisition of any supplies, medications or personal protective equipment, hiring of any staff, consultants or temporary workers, or reopening formerly closed hospital beds/wings, etc.
Principal payments would be required within 30 days of receipt of any COVID-19 Aid by the recipient health care organization in the amount of such COVID-19 Aid received, if any, until the loan is fully repaid.
Federal Aid
On May 2, Governor Murphy announced that 53 hospitals in New Jersey will receive $1.7 billion from the federal government. The funding will automatically be deposited with no paperwork required and is expected to arrive in early May.

 As stated in Section IV.B of the FDA's Policy for Coronavirus Disease-2019 Tests, a State or territory choosing to authorize laboratories within that State or territory to develop and perform a test for COVID-19 would do so under authority of its own State law, and under a process that it establishes. As noted in the guidance, FDA does not intend to object to the use of such tests for specimen testing where the notification of SARS-CoV-2 test validation is not submitted to FDA and the laboratory does not submit an EUA request to FDA, and where instead the State or territory takes responsibility for COVID-19 testing by laboratories in its State/territory during the COVID-19 outbreak.
The States and territories listed below have notified FDA that they choose to use this flexibility to expedite COVID-19 testing. As stated in the guidance, the FDA will not be reviewing the process adopted by the State or territory under this policy and is including this list here to provide transparency regarding the notifications submitted to FDA.

 With appropriate mitigations and validation, FDA believes that sample pooling can be safely implemented for use in certain diagnostic and screening tests. If you would like to develop and offer a test for use with sample pooling, please see the Molecular Diagnostic Template for Commercial Manufacturers or Molecular Diagnostic Template for Laboratories for recommendations on how to validate the test for this use and submit your EUA request to the FDA.
As outlined in the Policy for Coronavirus Disease-2019 Tests, the FDA is providing regulatory flexibility for developers that offer validated diagnostic tests, including for use with sample pooling, while the developers pursue an EUA from the FDA. This flexibility, including discussion of notification to FDA, is outlined in the guidance.
As discussed in the templates, there are currently two approaches to patient specimen pooling: 1) pooling aliquots of transport media each containing a single patient sample (sample/media pooling) or 2) adding swabs from multiple patients into a single volume of transport media (swab pooling). These templates include validation recommendations for both types of pooling approaches.
Generally, FDA recommends validating your test with either pooling approach in a way that preserves the sensitivity of your test as much as possible; that is, it is preferable to use an approach where all specimens identified as positive when tested individually are also identified as positive when tested using the pooled testing approach. However, a decrease in performance is likely with pooling strategies, due to dilution of the primary clinical sample. As discussed in the templates, since, sample pooling will greatly increase the number of individuals that can be tested using existing resources, a small reduction in sensitivity may be acceptable depending on the pooling efficiency and other mitigations in place. Therefore, FDA generally recommends that, after pooling, test performance includes ≥85% percent positive agreement (PPA) when compared with the same test performed on individual samples. Additional limitations, such as considering negative results from pooled samples to be presumptive negatives, may be recommended based on the patient population included in your clinical evaluation and the performance data submitted in your EUA request.
As discussed in the templates, laboratories should incorporate ongoing monitoring of the positivity rate and of the performance of their test with their pooling strategy. Commercial manufacturers should include a monitoring plan in their Instructions for Use and laboratories should include one in their procedures. As data become available and new approaches are identified, our recommendations in these templates may evolve. <SEP>  Does FDA have validation or other recommendations regarding SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic/screening tests for use with sample pooling?

Cites can encourage the use of masks in public through education and ensuring a sufficient supply, with enforcement as a last resort. The first step is to educate the public about the importance of wearing a mask to prevent the spread of the virus for those who have no symptoms (because they could be asymptomatic carriers), which includes those who eventually develop symptoms (while they are pre-symptomatic). Masks act as a physical barrier to protect other people from the wearer’s viral and bacterial particulates. They are most effective in reducing spread from an infected person to others, but they likely have at least some benefit to the wearer as well.  Leaders should make both arguments – that the masks protect both the wearer and others … some people will respond more to an argument about self-interest, some will respond more to an appeal to help others, and some will respond to both. The CDC has developed educational materials on the proper actions to protect yourself with a mask.
Cities can also request citizens to kindly remind their neighbors that wearing a mask is best practice or report when an individual is deliberately flaunting a mask-order or social distancing guidelines.
Many cities have set up drives to offer free masks to the public that include instructions on how to put on, use, take off, and dispose of masks after use. For example, Cambridge, Massachusetts set up a mask giveaway through the Police Department, meal distributions sites, and drive-throughs at elementary schools. The City of Burlington, Vermont, has given away over 20,000 reusable face masks produced by local Vermont companies.
Some cities have announced that people violating COVID-related face cover policies could be fined – but also emphasized that law enforcement would initially focus on educating those individuals as opposed to penalizing them.

All individuals, when in public, (e.g. parks, outdoor recreation areas, shopping areas), should maximize physical distance from others. Social settings of more than 10 people, where appropriate distancing may not be practical, must be avoided (e.g. receptions, trade shows). 
The number of individuals in a particular location will be strictly controlled in order to make sure that safe social distancing is maintained. Some of these limits are addressed for individual industries in the industry guidance, but where it is not otherwise stated, the upper limit is 30% of fire code occupancy (excluding staff) for Phase 1 (starting June 1, 2020).

Yes, you can make one out of a T-shirt or a bandana. If you’re using a shirt, cut a 7 in (18 cm) wide strip from the bottom of the shirt, then fold it in half lengthwise two times to make a long strip of fabric. Place rubber bands or hair ties on either end of the strip to use as ear loops. Fold the fabric over the hair ties, then put the mask on by grabbing it by the ear loops. 
To make one out of a bandana, follow the same steps (without the cutting part at the beginning).
If you have a sewing machine, you can sew your own face mask out of 2 layers of fabric. <SEP> Can I make my own mask? <EOS>
If you are sick with COVID-19 or think you may be infected with the COVID-19 virus, it is important not to spread the infection to others while you recover. While home-isolation or home-quarantine may sound like a staycation, you should be prepared for a long period during which you might feel disconnected from others and anxious about your health and the health of your loved ones. Staying in touch with others by phone or online can be helpful to maintain social connections, ask for help, and update others on your condition.Here's what the CDC recommends to minimize the risk of spreading the infection to others in your home and community.Stay home except to get medical care
Do not go to work, school, or public areas.
Avoid using public transportation, ride-sharing, or taxis.
Call ahead before visiting your doctor
Call your doctor and tell them that you have or may have COVID-19. This will help the healthcare provider's office to take steps to keep other people from getting infected or exposed.
Separate yourself from other people and animals in your home
As much as possible, stay in a specific room and away from other people in your home. Use a separate bathroom, if available.
Restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would around other people. When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick. If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets and wear a face mask.
Wear a face mask if you are sick
Wear a face mask when you are around other people or pets and before you enter a doctor's office or hospital.
Cover your coughs and sneezes
Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze and throw used tissues in a lined trash can.
Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds after you sneeze. If soap and water are not available, clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
Clean your hands often
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.
If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, covering all surfaces of your hands and rubbing them together until they feel dry.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
Don't share personal household items
Do not share dishes, drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils, towels, or bedding with other people or pets in your home.
After using these items, they should be washed thoroughly with soap and water.
Clean all "high-touch" surfaces every dayHigh touch surfaces include counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables.
Clean and disinfect areas that may have any bodily fluids on them.
A list of products suitable for use against COVID-19 is available here. This list has been pre-approved by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for use during the COVID-19 outbreak.
Monitor your symptoms
Monitor yourself for fever by taking your temperature twice a day and remain alert for cough or difficulty breathing.
	
If you have not had symptoms and you begin to feel feverish or develop measured fever, cough, or difficulty breathing, immediately limit contact with others if you have not already done so. Call your doctor or local health department to determine whether you need a medical evaluation.


Seek prompt medical attention if your illness is worsening, for example if you have difficulty breathing. Before going to a doctor's office or hospital, call your doctor and tell them that you have, or are being evaluated for, COVID-19.
Put on a face mask before you enter a healthcare facility or any time you may come into contact with others.
If you have a medical emergency and need to call 911, notify the dispatch personnel that you have or are being evaluated for COVID-19. If possible, put on a face mask before emergency medical services arrive. <SEP> What does it really mean to self-isolate or self-quarantine? What should or shouldn't I do? <EOS>
The risk of being infected on an airplane cannot be excluded, but is currently considered to be low for an individual traveller. The risk of being infected in an airport is similar to that of any other place where many people gather. If it is established that a COVID-19 case has been on an airplane, other passengers who were at risk (as defined by how near they were seated to the infected passenger) will be contacted by public health authorities. Should you have questions about a flight you have taken, please contact your local health authority for advice. 
The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has recommended measures to be taken by national authorities, such as thorough disinfecting and cleaning of aircraft after each flight serving high-risk destinations. EASA also recommended that airlines operating on all routes step up the frequency of cleaning, disinfect as a preventative measure and ensure full disinfection of any aircraft which has carried a passenger who was suspected or confirmed as being infected with COVID-19. Airport operators should similarly disinfect terminals regularly. <SEP> 3. What is the risk of infection when travelling by plane? <EOS>

While children seem to fare well during coronavirus infections, newborns do not have fully developed immune systems. A study of children conducted in China found that of various age groups, newborns were the most likely to develop severe to critical symptoms. It would be best to avoid visiting until after this outbreak is over. Not only could a visit place the infant at risk, but it could also infect the parent(s). For now it is advisable to stick to digital forms of communication.

Drafted 20 March 2020 <SEP> Is it safe to visit a newborn baby? If not, how long should I stay away? <EOS>
No. Employers must not use surgical masks or cloth face coverings when respirators are needed.
In general, employers should always rely on a hierarchy of controls that first includes efforts to eliminate or substitute out workplace hazards and then uses engineering controls (e.g., ventilation, wet methods), administrative controls (e.g., written procedures, modification of task duration), and safe work practices to prevent worker exposures  to respiratory hazards, before relying on personal protective equipment, such as respirators. When respirators are needed, OSHA's guidance describes enforcement discretion around use of respirators, including in situations in which it may be necessary to extend the use of or reuse certain respirators, use respirators beyond their manufacturer's recommended shelf life, and/or use respirators certified under the standards of other countries or jurisdictions.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and OSHA have described crisis strategies intended for use in healthcare in which surgical masks or cloth face coverings may offer more protection than no mask at all when respirators are needed but are not available. Such information is not intended to suggest that surgical masks or cloth face coverings provide adequate protection against exposure to airborne contaminants for which respirators would ordinarily be needed. Although OSHA's enforcement guidance describes equipment prioritization that includes surgical masks, employers must still comply with the provisions of any standards that apply to the types of exposures their workers may face. For example, the permissible exposure limits of all substance-specific standards, such as asbestos and silica, remain in place, and surgical masks are not an  acceptable means of protection when respirators would otherwise be required (e.g., when engineering, administrative, and work practice controls do not  sufficiently control exposures).
If respirators are needed but not available (including as described in the OSHA enforcement guidance noted above), and hazards cannot otherwise be adequately controlled through other  elements of the hierarchy of controls (i.e., elimination, substitution, engineering controls, administrative controls, and/or safe work practices), avoid  worker exposure to the hazard. Whenever a hazard presents an imminent danger, and in additional situations whenever feasible, the task should be delayed until feasible control measures are available to prevent exposures or reduce them to acceptable levels (i.e., at or below applicable OSHA permissible exposure limits). <SEP> Are surgical masks or cloth face coverings acceptable respiratory protection in the construction industry, when respirators would be needed but are not available because of the COVID-19 pandemic? <EOS>
Social distancing involves staying at least 6 feet away from other people to avoid catching or spreading a virus. It's a fancy term for avoiding crowds and minimizing physical contact. The safest thing to do during an outbreak is stay home as much as possible and minimize close contact with others. When you must go out, such as to shop for groceries, stay at least 6 feet away from others. <SEP> What is social distancing, and does it help? <EOS>

Outdoor activities will be safer than indoor activities, and they're also important for mental health and helping people get through this difficult time. I encourage outdoor activities where possible, with the normal physical distancing that we recommend in any setting. People from the same household don't need to observe that, but between households, people should be encouraged to keep space. (Dr. Caitlin Rivers, 5/26/20)
The CDC has released guidelines for outdoor parks and recreational facilities that advise against the use of playgrounds (which may have contaminated surfaces) and participation in organized sports that cannot be played with sufficient physical distance between players. Sports that can be played while maintaining distance, such as tennis and golf, may be permitted with clear guidance on safe play. The United States Tennis Association and the Professional Golfers’ Association both maintain web pages with COVID-specific safety information.
CDC guidelines suggest that while swimming itself may be a relatively safe activity, community pools and public beaches should only reopen with strict guidelines in place to maintain physical distancing practices and keep gatherings restricted to fewer than 10 people. The CDC also advises against opening water playgrounds or water parks. Additionally, California’s Riverside County has released guidance on private pool re-openings in residential communities. (Dr. Josh Sharfstein, 5/9/20) <SEP> What are the guidelines for tennis, golf, swimming, and other outdoor recreational activities? <EOS>
  Yes. There are practice alerts and guidelines  that address this type of intervention by an individual licensed and registered  in New York. As a licensed professional, you are responsible for confidentiality  and record-keeping, to the same extent as when providing direct, in-person  services.

If you are not licensed in New York, you may  not practice a restricted profession by either technology or in-person unless otherwise authorized pursuant to an Executive Order issued by the New York State Governor during a disaster emergency. Currently, pursuant to Executive Orders 202.15, mental health counselors, marriage and family therapists, creative  arts therapists and psychoanalysts who are licensed and in  current good standing in any state in the United States do not need  to hold a NYS license or registration to practice in the State of New York. Currently,  pursuant to Executive Orders 202.18, licensed  clinical social workers and licensed master social workers, who  are licensed and in current good standing in any state in the United  States  or in any province or territory of Canada, do not need  to hold a NYS license or registration to practice in the State of New York. <SEP> Can a licensee practice the  profession by using distance technology? <EOS>
It's going to depend on the level of community transmission you're seeing. You can do things at summer camps to reduce risk, but you can't eliminate it, so parents will have to make their own decisions. Being outside is definitely better than being inside. But the evidence tells us that kids can get infected and pass the infection on. You’re going to have a conversation with parents on one hand and camp operators on the other.
The draft guidelines that CDC has been trying to put out contains a section on day camps with some very good recommendations. If the data demonstrate an area is in a good place and ready to move forward, respecting people's ability to take some risk and follow all recommended guidelines, opening outdoor camps could be something to consider and then keep a close eye on.  (Dr. Josh Sharfstein, 5/13/20) <SEP> Can we go forward with outdoor summer programs for youth? <EOS>

“There is no evidence that COVID-19 can be spread to humans through the use of pools and hot tubs,” the CDC says. 
“Proper operation, maintenance, and disinfection (e.g., with chlorine and bromine) of pools and hot tubs should remove or inactivate the virus that causes COVID-19.”
But health officials still advise staying at least 6 feet away from others because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease. In other words, you probably won’t get coronavirus from the water, but you could get coronavirus from someone close to you in the water. 
As for drinking water, doctors say you don’t need to worry about coronavirus in the tap water because most municipal drinking water systems should remove or inactivate the virus. <SEP> Can coronavirus spread through water, like in a swimming pool or hot tub? <EOS>
The following contingency and crisis strategies are based upon these assumptions:

Facilities understand their current isolation gown inventory and supply chain
Facilities understand their isolation gown utilization rate
Facilities have reported supply chain issues to the Regional Healthcare Coalition
Facilities have already implemented other engineering and administrative control measures including:

Reducing the number of patients going to the hospital or outpatient settings
Excluding HCP not directly involved in patient care
Reducing face-to-face HCP encounters with patients
Excluding visitors to patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19
Cohorting patients and HCP
Maximizing use of telemedicine



Additional strategies include:

Selectively cancel elective and non-urgent procedures and appointments for which a gown is typically used by HCP.
Shift gown use towards cloth isolation gowns.
Consider the use of coveralls.
Use of expired gowns beyond the manufacturer-designated shelf life for training.
Use gowns or coveralls conforming to international standards.

Not likely. Although a lot is unknown about COVID-19, it doesn't appear that the virus can survive on dry surfaces, such as paper, plastic, or cardboard. Any products shipped to you should be safe to use without risk of contracting the disease.

I saw a medical test result that lists “coronavirus.” What should I do? 
Keep in mind that "coronavirus" is actually a broad term that describes a whole family of viruses, many of which cause the common cold. The current global outbreak is caused by a specific "novel" coronavirus that causes the disease COVID-19.  
The vast majority of coronavirus diagnoses will be the equivalent of being told that you have a common cold or flu, so a positive coronavirus test result is not a cause for alarm. This can be very confusing, so please talk to your doctor or care team if you see this word used.

 At this time, it appears that persons can shed SARSCoV 2 virus about 2 days before becoming ill and up to 8 days after symptoms onset. CDC has recently changed the home isolation for known cases of COVID 19 due to this updated information. It is now known that persons can be asymptomatic with COVID 19. So, it is important that persons continue measures including social distancing, respiratory hygiene, and the use of cloth face coverings in persons 2 years of age and older to reduce the spread of this virus. health officials do not know when someone with COVID-19 becomes contagious. <SEP>  How long can a person spread COVID-19? <EOS>
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has warned that Americans should brace for the likelihood that the virus will continue to spread in the U.S.

To protect others at home, someone
               who is sick should:

As much as possible, keep away from other people and pets in your home.
Wear a cloth face covering (or face mask, if you have one) if they must be around
               other people. Cloth face coverings are for use only by people older than 2 years old
               who are not having trouble breathing. Do not leave a child alone while they're wearing
               a cloth face covering. To see how to put on and remove cloth face coverings and face
               masks, clean them, or make your own cloth face covering, check the CDC's
               guide.
Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue,
               throw the tissue away, and then wash their hands right away. Wash with soap and water
               for at least 20 seconds, or use alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
If possible, stay in a bedroom and use a bathroom separate from other people in
               the home.
Use separate dishes, glasses, cups, and eating utensils and not share these with
               other household members. After use, run them through the dishwasher or wash with very
               hot soapy water.
Use separate bedding and towels and not share these with other household members. 

Also:

If the person who is sick can't wear a cloth face covering (or face mask), caregivers
               should wear one while they're in the same room.
Make sure shared spaces in the home have good air flow. You can open a window
               or turn on an air filter or air conditioner.
Do not allow visitors into your home. This includes children and adults. 
All household members should wash their
               hands well and often. Wash with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use
               alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
Wash the sick person's clothing, bedding, and towels with detergent on the hottest
               temperature possible. Wear gloves when handling their laundry, if possible. Wash your
               hands well after handling the laundry (even if you wore gloves).
Every day, use a household cleaner or wipe to clean things that get touched a
               lot. These include doorknobs, light switches, toys, remote controls, sink handles,
               counters, and phones. Keep a sick child's toys separate from other toys, if possible.

To protect others in your community:

The person who is sick should stay home unless they need medical
               care.
Other household members also should
               stay home. Follow instructions from your doctor, local health care department,
               or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about who should stay home
               and for how long.
If you must go out of the house, wear a cloth face covering or face mask and keep
               at least 6 feet (2 meters) of distance between you and other people.
Tell other people who were around the sick person. Your local or state health
               department can help you if you aren't sure who to notify. <SEP> What Should We Do at Home? <EOS>
Babies and toddlers under 2 years old shouldn't wear a mask because:

They have smaller airways, so breathing through
               a mask is harder for them.
If it's hard for them to breathe and they can't tell anyone or take the mask off
               by themselves, they could suffocate.
Some homemade masks might have pieces that a baby could choke on, such as strings
               or elastic bands.
They will likely try to remove the mask, causing them to touch their face a lot.
               This can increase their risk of catching and spreading the virus. <SEP> Why Shouldn't a Baby or Toddler Wear a Mask? <EOS>
The best way to protect your staff is to prevent exposure. Start by:

Staying informed about updates to CDC guidance via the CDC COVID-19 website.
Making sure staff are aware of COVID-19 symptoms and requiring staff with any flu-like symptoms to stay home (or be sent home if they develop symptoms while at the facility).
Offering telework for staff when feasible, and exploring ways to revise duties that require face-to-face interaction for staff at high-risk for severe illness.
Ensuring staff use everyday preventive actions (such as washing hands, avoiding touching their eyes, nose, and mouth, covering their cough).
Managing and monitoring staff absenteeism.

Alert local public health officials about large increases in staff absenteeism, particularly if absences appear due to respiratory illnesses (like the common cold or the flu, which have symptoms similar to COVID-19).


Offering flu shots to staff, as limiting cases of flu can speed up the identification of people with COVID-19.
Stocking and providing supplies that help prevent the spread of germs.
Routinely cleaning and disinfecting the facility.
Consult CDC guidance on recommended PPE for persons in direct contact with COVID-19 cases.

Review the Occupational Safety and Health Administration websiteexternal iconexternal icon and guidance for businesses and employers to identify any additional strategies the facility can use within its role as an employer.
Staff evaluating and providing care for people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 should follow the CDC Interim Clinical Guidance for Management of Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) and monitor the guidance website regularly for updates to these recommendations. Facilities without on-site health care capacity should make a plan for how they will ensure that suspected COVID-19 cases will be medically isolated, evaluated, tested (if indicated), and provided medical care. Contact and collaborate with your state, local, tribal, and territorial health departments for more specific guidance. <SEP> How can I lower the chance that my staff will get COVID-19? <EOS>
Only through a congressional law may TRICARE waive premium payments. There currently is no such law. The Defense Health Agency (DHA) is studying COVID-19’s effects on beneficiaries who pay enrollment fees or premiums for their TRICARE health plan during the national health emergency due to the pandemic.
For TRICARE Reserve Select (TRS), DHA is reviewing TRS premium payments for those in units which suspended paid drills. It hopes to have a decision soon.  Until there’s a decision, if you miss a payment or don’t pay on time, they contractor will disenroll you from TRS. Call your contractor for reconsideration if this happens. If you can’t keep up your TRS payments, you may also find health coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace: https://www.healthcare.gov/. <SEP> I’m a member of the National Guard/ Reserve and have TRS coverage.  What happens to me and my family if my employer shuts due to COVID-19 and I can’t pay the monthly TRS premium? <EOS>
Face coverings are generally required for all students, staff and other people present in any kindergarten through grade 12 school buildings or district offices or riding on school transportation vehicles. To provide a consistent, safe environment for students and staff, this requirement applies equally to kindergarteners, even those aged 5 or under. Students and staff have increased flexibility to wear face shields in certain circumstances, all of which are detailed in the Executive Order found at Executive Orders from Governor Walz and 2020-2021 Planning Guide for Schools (PDF). As with other settings, children under 2 years or anyone with a medical, developmental, or behavioral condition that makes it unreasonable to wear a face covering must not wear face coverings. <SEP> What are the requirements for schools? <EOS>
The outbreak of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK has evolved dramatically, and many countries have moved to a scenario of sustained community transmission with large numbers of cases infected. The rapid escalation of cases in countries such as Italy and Spain has placed an enormous pressure on the healthcare system and this has been a major challenge for local services. All countries in the EU have responded to the emerging situation through implementation of a comprehensive package of measures including surveillance, testing, case management and strategies to mitigate the impact of the pandemic such as physical distancing measures.[ <SEP> 2. How are countries in the EU/EEA and the UK responding to COVID-19? <EOS>
 We want everyone to know that we are doing everything we can to keep all parties involved safe, and to continue producing the data that American agriculture counts on.

Some people with coronavirus have mild or no symptoms. And in some cases, symptoms don’t appear until up to 14 days after infection. 
During that incubation period, it’s possible to get coronavirus from someone with no symptoms. It’s also possible you may have coronavirus without feeling sick and are accidentally infecting others. 
So anyone who has had close contact with someone known to have coronavirus should ask a health care provider about getting tested, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. <SEP> Why waste a test kit on a person without symptoms? <EOS>
All patients with scheduled surgeries or procedures taking place in a Cleveland Clinic ambulatory surgery center or operating room will be tested for COVID-19 within three days, or 72 hours, prior to their surgery or procedure date. When a surgery or procedure is scheduled, a COVID-19 test will also be ordered.
We have several testing locations, throughout Northeast Ohio and Florida, designated for patients who have an upcoming surgery or procedure. An appointment for the COVID-19 test will be scheduled at a location and time most convenient for the patient.
Can I get a COVID-19 test at another, non-Cleveland Clinic location for my surgery or procedure?

In the United States, your state public health lab or the CDC will confirm a COVID-19 infection. Outside the United States, your national health agency or WHO will determine if you are infected. If your doctor thinks you might have COVID-19, they will take samples of fluid from your nose and mouth. That fluid will be sent to a state or national lab to test for COVID-19. They might also test fluid from your lungs, or test your urine or stool to determine if you have any other infections. 

If you have pneumonia or difficulty breathing, your doctor might order X-rays of your lungs.
Diagnostic testing for COVID-19 is limited. For example, in the US, only state public health labs or the CDC can conduct the proper tests. Your doctor will likely designate you as a person under investigation (PUI) and keep you isolated until the test results return. Since state labs are now helping with testing, results are available faster than they were at the start of the outbreak. <SEP> How is someone diagnosed with COVID-19? <EOS>
Follow safe work practices when using cleaning chemicalspdf icon:

Always wear gloves appropriate for the chemicals being used when you are cleaning and disinfecting. Additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be needed based on the setting and product you are using.
Never mix household bleach with ammonia or any other cleaner.
Make sure that employees know which cleaning chemicals must be diluted and how to correctly dilute the cleaners they are using.
Employers must ensure employees are trained on the hazards of the cleaning chemicals used in the workplace in accordance with OSHA’s Hazard Communication standard (29 CFR 1910.1200external icon).
Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products for concentration, application method, and contact time. <SEP> How can I safely use cleaning chemicals? <EOS>
Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, only help protect people from these specific bacterial infections.

VDH recommends taking everyday precautions to stay healthy during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Watch your child for any signs of illness. If you see any sign of illness consistent with symptoms of COVID-19, particularly fever, cough, or shortness of breath, call your healthcare provider and keep your child at home and away from others as much as possible. Follow CDC’s guidance on “What to do if you are sick.”
Watch for signs of stress in your child.  Some common changes to watch for include excessive worry or sadness, unhealthy eating or sleeping habits, and difficulty with attention and concentration. For more information, see the “For Parents” section on CDC’s website, Manage Anxiety and Stress. Take time to talk with your child or teen about the COVID-19 outbreak. Answer questions and share facts about COVID-19 in a way that your child or teen can understand. Go to CDC’s Helping Children Cope with Emergencies or Talking with Children About COVID-19 for more information.
Teach and reinforce everyday preventive actions. Parents and caretakers play an important role in teaching children to wash their hands. Explain that hand washing can keep them healthy and stop the virus from spreading to others. Be a good role model—if you wash your hands often, they’re more likely to do the same. Make handwashing a family activity.
Help your child stay active. Encourage your child to play outdoors—it’s great for physical and mental health. Take a walk with your child or go on a bike ride.  Use indoor activity breaks (stretch breaks, dance breaks) throughout the day to help your child stay healthy and focused.
Help your child stay socially connected. Reach out to friends and family via phone or video chats. Write cards or letters to family members they may not be able to visit.Some schools and non-profits, such as the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning and The Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence, have resources for social and emotional learning. Check to see if your school has tips and guidelines to help support social and emotional needs of your child. <SEP> While school is out how do I keep my family healthy? <EOS>
Follow basic prevention measures such as washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds when you are done cleaning (and wash them again when you get home). In addition, consider changing your clothing before you leave work and putting them in the wash before you interact with your children and family members. <SEP> I'm worried about bringing germs home to my family. How can I protect them? <EOS>
Evidence continues to mount on the importance of universal face coverings in interrupting the spread of SARS-CoV-2. School staff and older students (middle or high school) may be able to wear cloth face coverings safely and consistently and should be encouraged to do so. Children under 2 years and anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove a face covering without assistance should not wear cloth face coverings. <SEP> Should a mask be worn during school? <EOS>
Pregnant healthcare personnel (HCP) should follow risk assessment and infection control guidelines for HCP exposed to patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Adherence to recommended infection prevention and control practices is an important part of protecting all HCP in healthcare settings.
Information on COVID-19 in pregnancy is very limited; facilities may want to consider limiting exposure of pregnant HCP to patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, especially during higher risk procedures (e.g., aerosol-generating procedures) if feasible based on staffing availability. <SEP> Are pregnant healthcare personnel at increased risk for adverse outcomes if they care for patients with COVID-19? <EOS>

When teens say they’re sad or upset about a canceled prom, graduation or birthday party, it’s tempting to tell them to look on the bright side. Don’t. 
“Often, the initial response from parents is to try to reframe their thoughts and say, ‘Well, at least you’re healthy,’ or ‘You’ll have other great experiences in the future,’” Dr. Conn says. But that leaves teens frustrated because they don’t feel understood.  
A better approach? Listen and empathize. “It’s more helpful to say, ‘Yeah, that’s really tough. I know you’ve worked really hard for this—I’m so sorry this happened,’” she says. “Give them space to process the loss.” <SEP> Acknowledge their feelings <EOS>
Employees may have been exposed if they are a “close contact” of someone who is infected, which is defined as being within about 6 feet of a person with COVID-19 for a prolonged period of time:

Potentially exposed employees who have symptoms of COVID-19 should self-isolate and follow CDC recommended steps.
Potentially exposed employees who do not have symptoms should remain at home or in a comparable setting and practice social distancing for 14 days.

All other employees should self-monitor for symptoms and wear cloth face coverings when in public. If they develop symptoms, they should notify their supervisor and stay home.
See Public Health Recommendations for Community-Related Exposure for more information.
To ensure continuity of operations of essential functions, CDC advises that critical infrastructure employeesexternal icon may be permitted to continue work following potential exposure to COVID-19, provided they remain symptom-free and additional precautions are taken to protect them and the community.

Critical infrastructure businesses have an obligation to limit, to the extent possible, the reintegration into the worksite of in-person employees who have been exposed to COVID-19 but remain symptom-free in ways that best protect the health of the employee, their co-employees, and the general public.

Remaining at home for 14 days may still be the most preferred and viable option for exposed employees.


An analysis of core job tasks and workforce availability at worksites can allow the employer to match core activities to other equally skilled and available in-person employees who have not been exposed.
A critical infrastructure employee who is symptom-free and returns to work should wear a cloth face covering at all times while in the workplace for 14 days after last exposure. Employers can issue cloth face coverings or can approve employees’ supplied cloth face coverings in the event of shortages.

The CDC says “older adults“ and people with serious chronic medical conditions “are at higher risk of getting very sick from this illness.” 
Anyone over 60 and those with underlying health problems should try to avoid places with large crowds – such as movie theaters, busy malls and even religious services, infectious disease experts say.
“This ought to be top of mind for people over 60, and those with underlying health problems,” said Dr. William Schaffner, a Vanderbilt University professor and longtime CDC adviser.
But why is age 60 often used as a threshold for those who need to be extra cautious?
“(The) average age of death for people from coronavirus is 80. Average age of people who need medical attention is age 60,” US Surgeon General Jerome Adams said.

According to CDC, disposable filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) are not approved for routine decontamination and reuse as standard of care. However, FFR decontamination and reuse may need to be considered as a crisis capacity strategy to ensure continued availability. Based on the limited research available, ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, vaporous hydrogen peroxide, and moist heat showed the most promise as potential methods to decontaminate FFRs. Please see CDC’s guidance document here.

The U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have established critical new measures designed to keep America’s nursing home residents safe from the virus that causes COVID-19. The measures direct nursing homes to significantly restrict visitors and nonessential personnel, as well as restrict group activities, including communal dining, inside nursing homes. While visitor restrictions may be difficult for residents and families, it is an important temporary measure for their protection.
Additionally:

Most people will not be able to visit loved ones at this time.  Some visitation may be approved on a case-by-case basis by the facility. If you are approved to visit your loved one in a nursing home, make sure you are not sick. If you are sick, postpone your visit until you can see your healthcare provider and get the proper management.
If you are not sick and visiting your relative in a nursing home, follow the proper hand hygiene and respiratory hygiene practices during your visit. The CDC recommends that all people entering a health facility wear a cloth face covering or face mask to prevent disease transmission. Observe posted signs for any special instructions.
If your loved one is sick, especially with respiratory symptoms, inform the healthcare provider at the nursing home for further guidance.

Clinicians should use their judgment to determine if a patient has signs and symptoms compatible with COVID-19 and whether the patient should be tested. Fever is the most commonly reported sign; most patients with confirmed COVID-19 have developed fever and/or symptoms of acute respiratory illness (cough, difficulty breathing).
Data regarding COVID-19 in pregnancy are limited; according to current information, presenting signs and symptoms are expected to be similar to those for non-pregnant patients, including the presence of fever.
Other considerations that may guide testing are epidemiologic factors such as the occurrence of local community transmission of COVID-19 infections. As part of evaluation, clinicians are strongly encouraged to test for other causes of respiratory illness and peripartum fever. For more information please see: Testing Overview for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) <SEP> Should intrapartum fever be considered as a possible sign of COVID-19 infection? <EOS>
The Emergency Regulations provide that, if you failed to make a timely premium payment due to financial hardship as a result of COVID-19, the insurer must give you the opportunity to repay such late premium in twelve (12) monthly installments if you can still demonstrate financial hardship due to COVID-19. In that situation, the insurer cannot terminate the policy, contract, or certificate immediately after the expiration of the extended grace period based on your past failure to pay the premium due to financial hardship as a result of COVID-19. <SEP> How much time will I have to repay overdue insurance payments? <EOS>
Not all patients with COVID-19 require hospital admission. Patients whose clinical presentation warrants in-patient clinical management for supportive medical care should be admitted to the hospital under appropriate Transmission-Based Precautions.
Some patients with initial mild clinical presentation may worsen in the second week of illness. The decision to monitor these patients in the inpatient or outpatient setting should be made on a case-by-case basis. This decision will depend not only on the clinical presentation, but also on the patient’s ability to engage in self-monitoring, the feasibility of safe isolation at home, and the risk of transmission in the patient’s home environment. For more information, see Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a Healthcare Setting and Interim Guidance for Implementing Home Care of People Not Requiring Hospitalization for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

As the world scales up public health responses to the COVID19 pandemic, countries are being urged to take decisive action to control the epidemic. WHO has urged all countries to ensure an appropriate balance between protecting health, preventing economic and social disruption, and respecting human rights.  WHO is working with partners including the UNAIDS Joint Programme and the Global Network of People Living with HIV to ensure that human rights are not eroded in the response to COVID-19 and to ensure that people living with or affected by HIV are offered the same access to services as others and to ensure HIV-related services continue without disruption.To mitigate potential prison outbreaks of COVID19 and reduce morbidity and mortality among people in prisons and other closed settings, it is crucial that prisons and immigration detention centres are embedded within the broader public health response. This requires close collaboration between health and justice ministries and includes protocols for entry screening, personal protection measures, physical distancing, environmental cleaning and disinfection, and restriction of movement, including limitation of transfers and access for non-essential staff and visitors.  In the current context it is of critical importance that countries work toward developing non-custodial strategies to prevent overcrowding in closed settings[10]. Governance of prison health by a ministry of health, rather than a ministry of justice or similar, is likely to facilitate this[11]. <SEP> How do we ensure human rights and reduce stigma and discrimination? <EOS>
There are steps you can take to treat the dead with dignity. 
If someone you love is in hospice or nearing the end, start planning. Death is always logistical. Now, it’s even more so. Call a few funeral homes to ask about pricing and procedure, and check your state laws on the size of the gathering.
If your religion mandates you bury someone within a specific period of time, turn to a religious leader for help. They will have worked with other people in your situation, and should have suggestions about how to cope. 
Understand that as much as you would like to honor your loved one in your traditional ways, the changed world has also affected funeral services. Consider the risk of a funeral gathering, and the comfort levels and health concerns of those who would like to attend. You may choose to organize a smaller in-person memorial, schedule a service at a later date or hold a Zoom memorial.
As for grieving? It’s going to be hard. You cannot hug your friends, and you cannot have them over. But with technology, you can lean on your community virtually. Maybe that’s just regular phone calls to your support network over the first few weeks. Or maybe that’s a Zoom shiva or wake. If you go the videoconferencing route, ask everyone to show up with a memory or a poem to share. Call on people one by one.

If your student is  recommended for integrated co-teaching, special class, or special education  teacher support services, your school will make every effort to have them  continue to receive instruction from the same special education teacher(s)  and/or teacher team(s) and classroom paraprofessional(s) that usually teach  them. 
Families of  students with Individualized Education Plans (IEP) should receive a Special  Education Remote Learning Plan, developed by the student's special education  teacher and other school-based staff with knowledge of the student. If you have  not received your child's Special Education Remote Learning Plan or discussed  it with your school, or if you would like to discuss the plan or request a  change at any time, please reach out to your child's teacher and/or related  service provider. You can also email specialeducation@schools.nyc.gov if you need help contacting your child's school.
IEP meetings will  be conducted over the phone. The school will send you copies of any documents  that will be discussed before the meeting. 
Families can refer  their child for special education evaluations by emailing the principal or specialeducation@schools.nyc.gov,  or by calling 311 and saying "special education evaluation." Assessments  may be conducted remotely. 
Services for  students with IEP will be provided via tele-therapy or video-conferencing where  clinically appropriate. Providers and schools will contact families to discuss  the service plan for each student. Providers will also give families  information about activities that can be done at home to reinforce the related  services work.
Schools will work  with families to ensure that students have access to devices recommended for  Assistive Technology, and will contact families to make those arrangements.

There are several actions and requirements that should be reviewed and put in place to ensure the safety of children and school staff while at school.  Special provisions should be considered for early childhood development, higher learning institutions, residential schools or specialized institutions. WHO recommends the following:Policy, practice and infrastructure: Ensure the necessary resources, policies and infrastructure are in place that protect the health and safety of all school personnel, including people at higher risk.Behavioural aspects: Consider the age and capacity of students to understand and respect measures put in place. Younger children may find it more difficult to adhere to physical distancing or the appropriate use of masks. Safety and security: School closure or re-opening may affect the safety and security of students and the most vulnerable children may require special attention, such as during pick-up and drop-off.Hygiene and daily practices: Hand hygiene and environmental cleaning measures should be in place to limit exposure. Schools should consider training of staff and students, a schedule for daily cleaning, availability of hand hygiene facilities and national/local guidance on the use of masks. Screening and care of sick students, teachers and other school staff: Schools should enforce the policy of “staying home if unwell”, waive the requirement for a doctor’s note, create a checklist for parents/students/staff to decide whether to go to school (taking into consideration the local situation), and consider options for screening on arrival.Communication with parents and students: Schools should keep students and parents informed about the measures being implemented to ensure their collaboration and support.Additional school-related measures such as immunization checks and catch-up vaccination programmes: Ensure continuity or expansion of essential services, including school feeding and mental health and psycho-social support. Physical distancing: Physical distancing of at least 1 metre between people should be implemented in the school premises and in the classrooms. This includes increasing desk spacing and staging recesses, breaks and lunchbreaks; limiting the mixing of classes or age groups; considering smaller classes or alternating attendance schedules, and ensuring good ventilation in classrooms.Remote learning: Tele-schooling and distance learning options such as delivering assignments, broadcasting lessons on radio or television and frequent follow-up support should be adapted to the situation. <SEP> What are the prevention and control measures to be prepared and put in place in schools? <EOS>
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.

If the IACUC can safely complete the semiannual facility inspections no later than 30 days beyond the six-month interval from the institution’s last inspections, there is no need to notify OLAW or request a waiver since this timeframe is compliant with OLAW’s guidance. However, Assured institutions that are unable to conduct facility inspections within this six month plus 30-day timeframe because of the COVID-19 pandemic, may request a waiver from OLAW (see NOT-OD-20-088). <SEP> 10.

Not necessarily. If  you have financial hardship due to COVID-19, you are protected from being  evicted for nonpayment of rent until at least August 20, 2020. 
If your landlord  wants to evict you, they will need to go to housing court and prove that you  were not affected by COVID-19. No landlord can evict a tenant without a court  order.
Even if you receive  a Notice of Eviction, you might be able to stay in your home. Call 311 and  say "Tenant Helpline" to be connected with assistance.
We expect more  changes on how Housing Court operates and handles eviction cases. You can call  311 and ask for the Tenant Helpline to get the latest updates, receive  legal counseling, and learn about the resources. <SEP> I am undocumented. Since I don't qualify for unemployment insurance or  certain state or federal benefits, does that mean I can be evicted? <EOS>
As food has not been implicated in the transmission of COVID-19, imported food should be subjected to the same import controls as before the pandemic.

Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets.
However, because animals can sometimes carry other germs that can make people sick, it’s always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, including washing hands before and after interacting with them. <SEP> Can animals carry the virus that causes COVID-19 on their skin or fur? <EOS>
Transmission risk depends on both duration of interaction with and proximity to an infected individual. The longer the length of the interaction and closer proximity, the greater the risk of becoming infected. 20 minutes is long enough for transmission so I would consider that interaction a risk. (Dr. Caitlin Rivers, 5/19/20) <SEP> How does length of an interaction affect the odds of COVID-19 infection?  For example, is sitting in a restaurant for a 90-minute meal risker than sitting in a coffee shop for 20 minutes? <EOS>
This is a lingering disease. Unlike flu, which comes on quickly and lasts about a week or 10 days, this disease seems to crescendo slowly over the course of about a week or 10 days, followed by a recovery period of two or three weeks and sometimes even longer. That's one of the reasons to worry about intensive care capacity. Severely ill people have been staying on ventilators for one to three weeks, so there are fewer ventilators to go around. Ninety-nine out of a hundred people with this infection who are able to receive necessary care are going to survive, but that still means far too many people won't. (Dr. Tom Frieden, 4/2/20) <SEP> Why are we not seeing a higher number of recoveries from COVID-19? <EOS>

Workers who test positive for COVID-19 will be notified of their results by their healthcare providers or  public health department and will likely be advised to self-isolate or seek  medical care. OSHA recommends that workers tell their supervisors if they have tested  positive for COVID-19 so that employers can take steps, such as cleaning and  disinfection, to protect other workers. Employers who become aware of a case  among their workers should:

Follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations for community-related exposure to someone with known or suspected COVID-19.
Follow CDC recommendations for when employees can return to work after having COVID-19.
Follow CDC cleaning and disinfection recommendations to protect other employees. <SEP> What should employers do when an employee  tests positive for COVID-19? <EOS>
Any decision about school dismissal or cancellation of school events should be made in coordination with your local health officials. Schools are not expected to make decisions about dismissals on their own.
You may need to temporarily dismiss school for 2-5 days, if a student or staff member attended school before being confirmed as having COVID-19. This initial short-term dismissal allows time for the local health officials to gain a better understanding of the COVID-19 situation impacting the school and for custodial staff to clean and disinfect the affected facilities. Work with the local health officials to determine appropriate next steps, including whether an extended dismissal duration is needed to stop or slow further spread of COVID-19.
If there is substantial transmission in the local community, local health officials may suggest extended school dismissalspdf iconpdf icon (e.g., dismissals for longer than two weeks). This longer-term, and likely broader-reaching, dismissal strategy is intended to slow transmission rates of COVID-19 in the community. <SEP> When should I dismiss our school/child care program? <EOS>

  Yes. The supervisor remains responsible  for the assessment, evaluation and treatment of each client seen by the  supervisee.  Supervised client contact hours completed through distance  technology may be submitted on Form 4B, as part of the supervised experience  requirement for licensure and do not have to be designated as such.

The Board of Regents approved an emergency  regulation that allows supervision by telephone or video technology during the  period covered by the Executive Orders relating to the COVID-19 health crisis.  The supervisor remains responsible for the assessment, evaluation, diagnosis  and treatment of each client seen under supervision. The emergency regulation  provides flexibility to the supervisor in regard to the weekly duration and  frequency of supervision sessions, during the COVID-19  related State of Emergency declared by the Governor in Executive Order 202.

All treatment and supervision provided through  distance technology must be completed through secure means, whether on the  telephone or through the use of video conferencing. Texting and email are not  acceptable forms of supervision at any time, other than to notify the  supervisor of an urgent situation that requires intervention. <SEP> Can a permit holder, intern  or other person only authorized to practice under supervision (supervisees) provide  client services by distance technology rather than in-person?

Using smokeless tobacco often involves some hand to mouth contact.  Another risk associated with using smokeless tobacco products, like chewing tobacco, is that the virus can be spread when the user spits out the excess saliva produced during the chewing process. <SEP> What about using smokeless tobacco, like chewing tobacco? <EOS>
The vaccine’s delivery will be critical to safely developing widespread immunity against COVID-19. The Regulatory Affairs Professionals Society has developed a COVID-19 vaccine tracker that outlines the status of the vaccines in Phase 1-3 trials as well as major candidates in pre-clinical stages of development and research. It should be noted, however, there are important questions to be worked out related to vaccine delivery. Rapidly producing billions of doses vastly exceeds current vaccine production capacity and would likely require costly repurposing of other facilities or the building of new manufacturing plants. The vaccine is likely to arrive in stages, with priority populations like healthcare workers first in line.  Some of the rules for how vaccine will be delivered will be promulgated at the federal or state level, but there are still likely to be issues about delivery and sequencing that need to be worked out at the local level. (Dr. Josh Sharfstein and Dutch Leonard, 5/27/20) <SEP> How would a COVID-19 vaccine be delivered? <EOS>
It is possible to find the coronavirus in wastewater, but research is ongoing to assess whether meaningful tracking can occur through this method. It is doubtful that wastewater will be an accurate measurement of infection rates, but it might be able to provide other useful information.

No. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses, some causing illness in people and others that circulate among animals, including camels, cats and bats. The recently emerged COVID-19 is not the same as the coronavirus that causes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) or the coronavirus that caused Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003. There are ongoing investigations to learn more. This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available. <SEP> Is COVID-19 the same as the MERS-CoV or SARS virus? <EOS>

The efficacy of these disinfection methods against the virus that causes COVID-19 is not known. EPA only recommends use of the surface disinfectants identified on List Nexternal icon against the virus that causes COVID-19. EPA does not routinely review the safety or efficacy of pesticidal devices, such as UV lights, LED lights, or ultrasonic devices. Therefore, EPA cannot confirm whether, or under what circumstances, such products might be effective against the spread of COVID-19. <SEP> How effective are alternative disinfection methods, such as ultrasonic waves, high intensity UV radiation, and LED blue light? <EOS>

In health facilities, large quantities of fresh and clean outdoor air are required to control contaminants and odours. There are three basic criteria for ventilation:ventilation rate: the amount and quality of outdoor air provided into the space;airflow direction: the direction of airflow should be from clean to less-clean zones; andair distribution or airflow pattern: the supply of air to each part of the space to improve dilution and removal of pollutants from the space.For health facilities in general, where aerosol generating procedures are not performed, ventilation of 60 litres/second per patient (L/s/patient) is adequate for naturally-ventilated areas, or 6 air changes per hour for mechanically-ventilated areas.For areas where aerosol generating procedures are performed, recommended ventilation rates are as follows:Naturally ventilated facilities/areas: the recommended average natural ventilation rate is 160 L/s/patient. Use of natural ventilation depends on favourable climate conditions (e.g. no risk of heat stress, no air pollution). Contaminated air should exhaust directly to the outside, away from air-intake vents, clinical areas, and people. Mechanically ventilated facilities/areas: where mechanical ventilation is available, negative pressure should be created to control the direction of airflow. The ventilation rate should be 6-12 air changes per hour, ideally 12 air changes per hour for new constructions, with a recommended negative pressure differential of ≥2.5Pa (0.01-inch water gauge) to ensure that air flows from the corridor into the patient room. Air from the facility/area or patient room can be exhausted directly to the outdoors, where droplet nuclei will be diluted in the outdoor air, or passed internally through a special HEPA filter that removes most (99.97%) of droplet nuclei (aerosols) before it is returned to general circulation. If a HEPA filter is not used, the air should be exhausted directly to the outside away from air-intake vents, people and animals. <SEP> What are the recommended air ventilation requirements for health facilities? <EOS>

Meditating is a great way to take care of your stress. If you’re a novice looking to start, try for just five minutes every day. There’s no right way to do it, but a consistent practice is a good way to build your relaxation muscles.

One of the most important jobs of a mayor at this time is to continually stress the seriousness of the virus and the necessity of adhering to effective social distancing measures as long as the data indicates they are still needed to control the spread of the disease, preserve capacity within the healthcare system, and minimize deaths and serious illness within the community. Mayors can also communicate that they, too, want businesses to be able to re-open as soon as possible and should continually update local business owners about emerging plans to re-open. Such plans could feature phased re-openings, in which restaurants may first be allowed to focus on takeout and delivery, then offer outdoor and socially-distanced dining, and eventually some sort of indoor dining arrangement as conditions increasingly improve and certain benchmarks are met. In the end, though, defiance of a health order is either a civil or criminal violation and should be treated as such. 
Mayors also need not do this work alone. They can work through the local Chamber of Commerce or business advisory groups, who may have more sway with the restaurant(s) disregarding the policies. (In fact, making a concerted effort to engage with these stakeholders and treat them like partners may minimize such violations in and of itself – or lead to creative solutions city government may not consider on its own.) Using local health officials to help spread the message can help de-politicize the issue. Getting other employers from the same industry, such as other restaurant owners, to validate the orders publicly can also be useful.   And employing different tones can also be helpful. The City of Chicago, for example, has been using the recent viral popularity of a humorous meme to further encourage social distancing. These measures can prevent restaurants or other businesses from unlawfully re-opening in the first place.

COVID-19 has an incubation period as long as 14 days. Generally, this means that if you're exposed to COVID-19, you could get sick from the virus up to two weeks after you were first exposed. Quarantine yourself and notify your doctor that you may need to be tested. From there, the public health department will monitor your progress and tell you when it’s safe to leave quarantine. 

Even if you do get sick during that 14-day period, it might not necessarily be related to COVID-19. You could get sick because of something else.
If 14 days pass and you don't show any signs of illness, this generally means that you're no longer at risk for getting sick from COVID-19 or passing the illness on to others. <SEP> How long should I isolate myself if I'm exposed to COVID-19? <EOS>

Find out what safety precautions your child's school is taking. Ask about:

Cleaning and disinfecting. Schools should follow advice from
               the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for cleaning and disinfecting
               common areas. Surfaces that get touched a lot (such as bathroom handles and knobs,
               keyboards, and doorknobs) should be cleaned as often as possible but at least daily.
Health screenings and monitoring. Schools may check kids for
               symptoms of coronavirus each day. This can include temperature checks and symptom
               surveys at home or in school. If someone gets sick, there should be a process for
               isolating them, reporting exposures, and returning to school. Students, teachers,
               or school staff should stay home if they are
               sick. Kids should not go to school if they have had close contact with
               someone with COVID-19.
Face coverings. All adults should wear masks
               or cloth face coverings, as should middle school and high school students. Preschoolers
               and elementary school-age kids — if they can keep from touching their faces
               a lot — also should wear masks.
Hand washing. Students and staff should wash
               their hands with soap and water well and often. They also can use hand sanitizer
               if water is not available.
Social distancing
               (also called physical distancing). Adults and students should stay 6 feet
               apart whenever possible. In the classroom, spacing desks 3–6 feet apart and
               having students wear cloth face coverings will help prevent the spread of coronavirus.
Class or group size. Some schools may limit class sizes, place
               students in cohorts, stagger schedules, or do a hybrid of online and in-person learning.
               A cohort is a group of students and teachers who stay together throughout
               the school day. Check with your school to find out their specific plans.
Other ways to lower risk. Schools across the country are figuring
               out creative ways to reduce
               the spread of germs. They might:
               
Hold classes and activities outside as much as possible.
Have teachers change rooms rather than kids.
Have meals in the classroom instead of the cafeteria.
Mark floors to show students where to stand and walk.
Have students ride the bus in assigned seats that are distanced apart.



Schools that follow these practices can lower the chances of COVID-19 spreading
               among students and staff. But that doesn't mean infections can't still happen. In
               case of an outbreak, schools should have a plan ready that includes full-time distance
               learning at home. <SEP> Is My Child's School Following All COVID-19 Safety Measures? <EOS>

Most children who become infected with the COVID-19 virus have no symptoms, or they have milder symptoms such as low-grade fever, fatigue, and cough. Early studies suggested that children do not contribute much to the spread of coronavirus. But more recent studies raise concerns that children could be capable of spreading the infection.Though the recent studies varied in their methods, their findings were similar: infected children had as much, or more, coronavirus in their upper respiratory tracts as infected adults.The amount of virus found in children — their viral load — was not correlated with the severity of their symptoms. In other words, more virus did not mean more severe symptoms.Finding high amounts of viral genetic material — these studies measured viral RNA, not live virus — in kids does not prove that children are infectious. However, the presence of high viral loads in infected children does increase the concern that children, even those without symptoms, could readily spread the infection to others. <SEP> Are kids any more or less likely than adults to spread coronavirus? <EOS>

You should only be socialising in groups of up to two households (including your support bubble) indoors and outdoors or up to six people from different households when outdoors.
More generally, you can continue to meet in larger groups if necessary for work, voluntary or charitable services, education, childcare or training, elite sporting competition or training, to fulfil legal obligations, to provide emergency assistance, or to enable someone to avoid illness, injury or risk of harm.
It is otherwise against the law for gatherings of more than 30 people to take place in private homes (including gardens and other outdoor spaces). Businesses and venues following COVID-19 Secure guidelines can host larger groups. This is also the case for events in public outdoor spaces that are organised by businesses, charitable or political organisations, and public bodies, provided they take reasonable steps to mitigate the risk of transmission, in line with COVID-19 Secure guidance and including completion of a risk assessment. This can include weddings, civil partnership ceremonies and funerals (which we advise should be limited to no more than 30 people), religious ceremonies and services, community activities and support groups. Any other gathering in an outdoor space or in a private home (or garden) must not be any larger than 30 people. <SEP> 2.9 Can I gather in larger groups for any reason? <EOS>
It is one of the most important tools available to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Contact tracing interrupts chains
    of COVID-19 transmission by helping to ensure Public Health can identify potential contacts of any person who tests
    positive for COVID-19 and support them in safely quarantining. It helps to slow the spread of the virus throughout
    our County. Contact tracing allows for far fewer restrictions to be put on the activities of the community because
    COVID-19 transmission chains can be traced and contained before they spread uncontrollably. More information about
    the County’s case investigation and contact tracing operations is available here. <SEP> What is “case investigation and contact tracing?” <EOS>
Your immune system is your body's defense system. When a harmful invader — like a cold or flu virus, or the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 — gets into your body, your immune system mounts an attack. Known as an immune response, this attack is a sequence of events that involves various cells and unfolds over time.Following general health guidelines is the best step you can take toward keeping your immune system strong and healthy. Every part of your body, including your immune system, functions better when protected from environmental assaults and bolstered by healthy-living strategies such as these:
Don't smoke or vape.
Eat a diet high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
Take a multivitamin if you suspect that you may not be getting all the nutrients you need through your diet.
Exercise regularly.
Maintain a healthy weight.
Control your stress level.
Control your blood pressure.
If you drink alcohol, drink only in moderation (no more than one to two drinks a day for men, no more than one a day for women).
Get enough sleep.
Take steps to avoid infection, such as washing your hands frequently and trying not to touch your hands to your face, since harmful germs can enter through your eyes, nose, and mouth. <SEP> What can I do to keep my immune system strong? <EOS>
Patients should receive any interventions they would normally receive as standard of care. Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be asked to wear a surgical mask as soon as they are identified and be evaluated in a private room with the door closed, ideally an airborne infection isolation room, if available. Healthcare personnel entering the room should use Standard Precautions, Contact Precautions, Airborne Precautions, and use eye protection (e.g., goggles or a face shield). <SEP> Should any diagnostic or therapeutic interventions be withheld due to concerns about transmission of COVID-19? <EOS>
Employees should telework to the extent they are able to do so. If the employee cannot telework and is asymptomatic, they should contact their agency HR office to determine whether protective measures can be put in place that would allow them to continue to report to the workplace. <SEP> Should employees self-quarantine if they have been in close contact (within 6 feet for at least 15 minutes) with people who are awaiting results of a COVID-19 test?

Some types of travel and activities are higher risk for exposure to COVID-19 (see list below).  If your family member participated in higher risk activities or may have been exposed before or during their trip, they should take extra precautions to protect others for 14 days after arrival:

Stay home as much as possible.


Avoid being around people at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.


Consider getting tested for COVID-19.

Here are examples of activities and situations that can increase travel related risk of exposure to COVID-19:

Being in an area that is experiencing high levels of COVID-19 spread. You can check the levels for places traveled, including countries, U.S.. states and territories, counties, and cities.
Going to a large social gathering like a wedding, funeral, or party.
Attending a mass gathering like a sporting event, concert, or parade.
Being in crowds – for example, in restaurants, bars, airports, bus and train stations, or movie theaters.

Traveling on a cruise ship or river boat. <SEP> My loved one recently returned from another country and is not reporting any symptoms. What are the best practices to protect our family members who all live close together? <EOS>
Unless there is a local public health order stating otherwise, child care programs can remain open or re-open.  There will be some variation for preschool programs that are based on a school campus: if the school campus is closed, then the local school district will decide if the childcare or preschool program can open <SEP> Do these new guidelines apply to preschool? <EOS>
​There are measures in place to assure Trade affected workers meet their training enrollment deadline.If all criteria are met, a “Health” waiver can be applied to secure your benefits. <SEP> ​​What if I or my child become ill and I cannot begin Trade training? <EOS>
 The letter to health care providers is intended to aid in the management of gowns and surgical masks. The FDA's recommendations in the letter should supplement a health care organization's policy. <SEP>  My health care organization already has a plan for protection against COVID-19, which includes other types of protective equipment (such as Powered Air Purifying Respirators (PAPRS) or Controlled Air Purifying Respirators (CAPRS)) and other strategies. Are we required to follow the FDA's recommendations listed in the letter to health care providers? <EOS>
 Yes, please visit NIFA’s Coronavirus web page www.nifa.usda.gov/coronavirus for guidance to the OMB memo, which provides administrative relief to recipients and applicants affected by the loss of operational capacity and increased costs due to the COVID-19 crisis. Additional questions regarding administrative relief provisions should be directed to USDA NIFA’s Awards Management Division at awards@usda.gov. <SEP>  Are NIFA awards covered under OMB’s M-20-17, “Administrative Relief for Recipients and Applicants of Federal Financial Assistance Directly Impacted by the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) due to Loss of Operations?” <EOS>
The testing and diagnosis of COVID-19 is free for many uninsured Minnesotans. When you go in for your test, ask your health care provider for the application for free COVID-19 testing. The provider will submit the application to the state and will bill the state for payment if you meet eligiblity requirements.
You may be eligible for low- to no-cost health care for coverage. Please contact MNsure or the Minnesota Department of Human Services to learn more about coverage options. <SEP> What should you do if you don't have health insurance? <EOS>
While there are a number of therapeutics currently in clinical trials in China and more than 20 vaccines in development for COVID-19, there are currently no licensed vaccines or therapeutics for COVID-19.  In contrast, antivirals and vaccines available for influenza. While the influenza vaccine is not effective against COVID-19 virus, it is highly recommended to get vaccinated each year to prevent influenza infection. <SEP> What medical interventions are available for COVID-19 and influenza viruses? <EOS>
Anyone who has close contact with a person with COVID-19 will need to stay away from other people for at least 14 days to make sure they aren’t sick as well. This means that they will be placed in a room separate from others, or just with other people who have also been exposed to the same sick person. During this time, they will be checked for COVID-19 symptoms. If testing is available, a person in quarantine may be tested several times until medical staff are sure they do not have the virus. <SEP> What does it mean to be in quarantine? <EOS>
Isolation: This is when someone who is infected with the virus
               and is contagious needs to stay home for 10 days after symptoms start or they
               have a positive test result. <SEP> What Does Isolation Mean? <EOS>
Not necessarily. Many people choose to self-quarantine to reduce the risk of contracting a virus or flu during an outbreak in their area. They're also doing this to protect their community by reducing the risk of spreading it further. During the outbreak, stay 6 feet away from people who aren't in your household and only go out to shop once a week. This will help protect you and the people in your neighborhood. <SEP> Do you have to be sick to be quarantined? <EOS>
Ultraviolet (UV) rays are part of sunlight. Studies show that UV light can be used to kill airborne COVID-19 particles and disinfect surfaces. For this reason, some hospitals, subways, and other public locations are using UV light to help disinfect areas when they are not occupied by people. While helpful for cleaning these areas, UV light has not been shown to prevent COVID-19 infection in humans or to kill the virus in infected patients.  The safety and efficacy of many UV light devices sold to the public are not routinely reviewed, so these should be used with caution. Overexposure to ultraviolet rays can have harmful health effects and is a major risk factor for cancer. For these reasons, you should wear sunscreen on exposed skin when you’re in the sun for long periods. <SEP> Does UV light kill coronavirus? <EOS>
 After the decision is made to test, the state animal health officials will identify the appropriate person to collect the sample using appropriate personal protective equipment and sample collection methods (PDF, 9.5 MB). <SEP>  Who will collect the samples from animals? <EOS>

Respirators with exhalation valves protect the wearer from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, but may not prevent the virus spreading from the wearer to others (that is, they may not be effective for source control). Until data are available to describe how effective respirators with exhalation valves are in preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 from the wearer to others:

Wear a respirator without an exhalation valve when both source control and respiratory protection are required.
If only a respirator with an exhalation valve is available and source control is needed, cover the exhalation valve with a surgical mask, procedure mask, or a cloth face covering that does not interfere with the respirator fit. ​ <SEP> Can a respirator with an exhalation valve be used as source control? <EOS>
 Please refer to Section V.C. of the FDA guidance Policy for Coronavirus Disease-2019 Tests, where we have provided recommendations regarding the testing to be performed to demonstrate that a SARS-CoV-2 antibody test is validated based upon the underlying technological principles of the test. As stated in the guidance, FDA recommends the following studies be performed for serology tests: cross-reactivity, class specificity, and clinical agreement. Depending on the characteristics of your test, such as what specimen types you are claiming, additional validation studies may be recommended in the guidance, e.g., matrix equivalency.
Additional information on the FDA's recommendations for validation testing can be found in the EUA templates provided to help facilitate the preparation, submission, and authorization of an EUA.

Motor Vehicle Commission agencies are open to the public six days a week, Mondays through Saturdays.
To reduce wait times and minimize in-person interactions, many transactions can now be conducted online. Check the NJ MVC online services page to see if you can "Skip the Trip" to the agency. Transactions that can be done online will not be available in person at this time.
NOTE: You can expect long lines as MVC agencies work through a three-month backlog. See if you can conduct business online. Take advantage of the extensions to expiration dates described below. Wait a few more days if possible. Do not camp out overnight at an MVC agency or facility. To ensure sufficient staffing, MVC personnel have been exempted from state furloughs.
LICENSE EXTENSIONS
All driver licenses, non-driver IDs, vehicle registrations, inspection stickers, and temporary tags that expired between March 13th and May 31 have been extended to September 30th.
Documents expiring between June 1st to August 31st have been extended to December 31st. All automatic extensions are automatic.
In addition, the federal REAL ID requirement has been extended for another year, until October 2021.
Most renewals of driver licenses, non-driver IDs, and registrations -- including some commercial registrations -- can be processed online at NJMVC.gov. Customers can change their address, pay fees, and access other services online as well.
LICENSING AND VEHICLE CENTERS
In order to maintain social distancing, some agencies have been designated as Licensing Centers and some as Vehicle Centers.
Vehicle Centers will only process vehicle transactions:

Registration/title transfers for private sales
New registrations/titles, individual and in bulk.
Salvage titles.
License plate transactions.
No renewals for unexpired registrations. Those can be done online at NJMVC.gov.
No license transactions.

Licensing Centers will only process license transactions:

First-time licenses and permits (REAL ID will be an option).
Out-of-state transfers.
Expired CDLs, TVRs (temporary visa restricted licenses), and any other expired licenses not eligible for online renewal.
REAL ID, only if you have a scheduled appointment, you have an email verifying your appointment was cancelled, or you are due for renewal of your standard license. No other REAL ID walk-ins will be allowed. The federal REAL ID requirement has been extended until October 2021.
No driver knowledge tests are available at this time.
No renewals, replacements, or changes of address for unexpired licenses/IDs. Those can be done online at NJMVC.gov.
No vehicle transactions: no registration or title work

WRITTEN DRIVER TESTS
Starting August 3, driver knowledge exams, also known as written driver tests, will be available to all drivers, including commercial drivers, by appointment.
Appointments can be made up to thirty days in advance, at https://mymvc.state.nj.us/apps/schedule-knowledge-test-appointment.html. Demand will be high, so it may take time to secure an appointment.
All Licensing Centers except Oakland and Flemington will offer the tests.
ROAD TESTS
Road tests re-started on June 29. If your appointment was schedule for before that date and canceled during the COVID-19 closure, you should have received a letter with a link to schedule your appointment at one of 11 new Road Test sites that are exclusively serving those who were canceled. If you should have received a letter and didn't, contact the MVC.
If you do not yet have an appointment, you can make one at NJMVC.gov.
NEW SAFETY PROTOCOLS FOR MVC OPERATIONS
Customers and employees will be required to wear a face covering. If a customer cannot wear a face covering, MVC will make other arrangements for their transaction.

A temporary loss of smell is relatively common among people who have coronavirus and could be added to a checklist of symptoms to determine whether someone should consider themselves infected. It is not, however, a universal feature of coronavirus infection. (Dr. Josh Sharfstein, 4/6/20) <SEP> Can you comment on the loss of smell as an early coronavirus indicator? <EOS>
Yes. Recipients may submit extension requests to the funding IC for consideration when the effects of COVID-19 have had a substantial impact on the planned course of the research training/activities. Extension requests must include a description of how COVID-19 affected the NRSA and/or other fellowship award, and clearly outline how much additional time is needed.  All such requests must be signed by the fellow, the Authorized Organization and the fellowship sponsor. Extensions may be provided. Please contact the funding Institute or Center to provide information about the specific project. <SEP> 5. Can I request an extension for a Ruth L.

A little exposure to germs is usually okay for kids to help build a healthy immune system, but it can be a problem during a disease outbreak or if your child has a weak immune system. If they're touching their cheeks or their forehead, away from the eyes, nose and mouth, then it may not be a big deal. But if you're concerned, talk to your child about germs and explain the importance of keeping their hands off their face. Help them find new stims that fulfill the same purpose. For more, see the wikiHow article on redirecting a child's harmful stims

Yes. All businesses operating in any way in the County, including businesses that completed a Social Distancing
    Protocol under a prior Order, must complete and implement a new one using the most recent (July 2) version and
    submit it at www.COVID19prepared.org using the
    County’s online form. The new Social Distancing Protocol must be completed and submitted before the new Order goes

It may be difficult to know whether your loved one has coronavirus or another illness.
                So it’s critical to play it safe and not infect yourself and, in turn, others. The CDC suggests: 

Giving the sick person their own room to stay in, if possible. Keep the door closed.
Having only one person serve as the caretaker.
Asking the sick person to wear a face mask, if they are able to. If the mask causes breathing difficulties, then the caretaker should wear a mask instead. <SEP> How do I safely take care of someone who’s sick? <EOS>
Yes. Those who are able to telework with pay or those receiving paid sick or other leave benefit generally do not qualify for unemployment benefits. There may be exceptions for those who were previously working full-time and are now reduced to part-time telework. Anyone in that category should file for unemployment benefits as you may be entitled to reduced benefits. <SEP> Are there any workers that the unemployment expansion does not cover? <EOS>
Drinking is a hard one. If you imbibe, it makes a lot of sense that you are drinking more now. The coronavirus can be both stressful and boring, and drinking can dull the stress of waiting. New Yorkers, for example, flocked to buy cheap wine. 
And although you might have normally had wine with friends, drinking alone — especially if you live alone — is not inherently frightening. 
But substance abuse experts say they are worried that the pandemic could also trigger more serious drinking problems and even create new ones for people who have never struggled with dependency before. And without regular meetings, alcoholics are struggling to stay sober without the help of counselors and group support.
There is no right answer as to when it’s time for you to be worried. Some questions, though, might help you get a clearer sense of the problem. These are drawn from several self-administered quizzes put out by rehabilitation facilities and medical centers, but are mostly common sense gut checks.
First, just try to quantify your drinking. How many days a week do you drink? When you do drink, how many drinks do you have? Is there a time of day that you most want to drink? Can you sleep without a drink? 
What about your attitude toward drinking? Do you get angry or irritable when someone tries to take your alcohol away, or suggest you might have a problem? Are you secretive about drinking? 
And, primarily, have your drinking patterns changed dramatically since the pandemic started? Have you had major life changes — beyond lockdown — like losing your job or the death of a relative? 
If your answer to some, or many of these questions, is yes, it might be time to step back and reconsider. If it continues to escalate, talk with friends, family and doctors about what professional help might look like. <SEP> I am drinking a lot. Should I be worried? <EOS>
Serological tests (tests that look for antibodies specific to a bacteria or virus) are a common diagnostic for other infections and could be developed. A serological test could tell you if you have a current infection or have been infected in the past. Researchers in Singapore and China, and a company called EUROIMMUN, have claimed that they have developed a serological test to detect the presence of antibodies against the virus that causes COVID-19. While the tests developed in Singapore and by EUROIMMUN still require validation and approval, researchers from China state that their test has been commercialized.

Many parents whose children have chronic health issues are understandably scared about COVID-19. But these children should absolutely be coming in for their appointments. It’s critical that parents continue to follow their child’s care plan—getting any needed imaging or scans, blood tests, treatments and exams so the doctor can monitor their child’s condition. 
This care plan is carefully designed to keep your child as healthy as possible. Delaying or skipping care could cause your child’s condition to worsen. That is the last thing we want to happen. <SEP> What if my child has a chronic condition? <EOS>
 During the MCO-AHCCCS Weekly COVID-19 call on 3/16, Director Snyder conveyed the message that AHCCCS expects the health plans to check in with critical provider types to ensure these providers, such as Mobile Crisis providers, Stabilization Crisis providers, Long Term Care facilities, and Outpatient Treatment Program (OTP) providers have Continuity of Operations Plans (COOP) and have reviewed them with staff. This expectation to check in does not mean that the health plans need to request copies of providers’ COOP documents. <SEP>  Do the Health Plans need to request and review COOP documents from providers? <EOS>
All businesses, including non-profits, educational entities, and non-governmental organizations must complete and
    submit a Social Distancing Protocol. Businesses that have multiple facilities in the County must submit a separate

    would interfere with completing an essential governmental function. <SEP> What entities have to complete a Social Distancing Protocol? <EOS>
​Regardless of whether you grant or deny a request for paid sick leave or expanded family and medical leave, you must document the following:The name of your employee requesting leave;The date(s) for which leave is requested;The reason for leave; andA statement from the employee that he or she is unable to work because of the reason.If your employee requests leave because he or she is subject to a quarantine or isolation order or to care for an individual subject to such an order, you should additionally document the name of the government entity that issued the order. If your employee requests leave to self-quarantine based on the advice of a health care provider or to care for an individual who is self-quarantining based on such advice, you should additionally document the name of the health care provider who gave advice.If your employee requests leave to care for his or her child whose school or place of care is closed, or childcare provider is unavailable, you must also document:The name of the child being cared for;The name of the school, place of care, or childcare provider that has closed or become unavailable; andA statement from the employee that no other suitable person is available to care for the child.Private sector employers that provide paid sick leave and expanded family and medical leave required by the FFCRA are eligible for reimbursement of the costs of that leave through refundable tax credits. If you intend to claim a tax credit under the FFCRA for your payment of the sick leave or expanded family and medical leave wages, you should retain appropriate documentation in your records. You should consult Internal Revenue Service (IRS) applicable forms, instructions, and information for the procedures that must be followed to claim a tax credit, including any needed substantiation to be retained to support the credit. You are not required to provide leave if materials sufficient to support the applicable tax credit have not been provided. <SEP> ​If my employee takes paid sick leave or expanded family and medical leave to care for their child whose school, place of care, or childcare provider is closed due to COVID-19, what records do I need to keep? <EOS>

Institutions of higher education may resume all in-person instruction in accordance with the safety requirements and guidance outlined by the Office of the Secretary of Higher Education (OSHE) and Executive Order No. 155.
Institutions must provide students with the option of participation via remote instruction to the extent practicable.
In addition, computer labs at private and public colleges and universities may reopen so long as they adhere to the required safety protocols detailed in Administrative Order No. 2020-17 and OSHE-submitted restart plans.
Colleges and universities must submit their restart plans to OSHE at least 14 days before any staff or students return to campus. These plans will be reviewed in coordination and consultation with the Department of Health.
Safety Requirements
The following summarizes some of the protocols contained in Executive Order No. 155 and OSHE's Restart Standards for all New Jersey Institutions of Higher Education. However, this summary is not a replacement for fully complying with the terms of EO 155 and OSHE's Restart Standards, and institutions should read the full guidance carefully to ensure full compliance.
Institutes of higher education must create policies and procedures that include:

Use of face coverings for faculty, staff, students, and visitors, except when doing so would inhibit the individual's health
Frequent cleaning and sanitization of classrooms, residences, restrooms, high-touch areas,equipment and shared surfaces
Maintenance of adequate supplies, such as personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies
Continued remote instruction for faculty and/or students who are unable to participate in in-person instruction
Social distancing in classrooms, residence halls, restrooms, and other areas across campus
Limitations on the number of students who may return to residence halls and restricted access to residential common areas
Designation of space(s) for separation of individuals residing on campus who display symptoms consistent with or have a positive diagnosis of COVID-19
A plan for on-campus transportation, which should include protocols for transporting sick students residing on campus to essential appointments as needed

In addition, institutions will be responsible for establishing screening and testing protocols on their campus for employees and students. As access to testing and testing reliability changes, institutions will need to update their protocols.
For a full list of safety requirements and procedures, refer to the OSHE's Restart Standards for all New Jersey Institutions of Higher Education.
GRADUATION CEREMONIES
Colleges and universities may hold modified in-person graduation ceremonies beginning July 6.
Drive-through/drive-in and modified in-person, outdoor ceremonies will be permitted subject to requirements for college/university commencement ceremonies.
Outdoor ceremonies must comply with the 500-person limit on outdoor gatherings. Social distancing must be in place, and face masks are required whenever social distancing is difficult to maintain.
To learn more about the requirements for in-person graduation ceremonies, refer to the Office of the Secretary of Higher Education's (OSHE) guidance for colleges/universities.
All institutions that plan to hold modified in-person ceremonies must certify to OSHE – via an online submission form – that the planned ceremony will comply with applicable requirements for gatherings, including those addressing social distancing.

​The Pennsylvania Minimum Wage Act requires that employees be paid for all hours worked.It does not require employers who are unable to provide work to employees to pay them for hours the employees would have otherwise worked.Generally, salaried employees who are exempt from overtime must receive their full salary in any week in which they perform work, subject to very limited exceptions. <SEP> ​​How many hours is an employer obligated to pay an hourly-paid employee who works a partial week because the employer’s business closed? <EOS>
​You may require that the employee provide the qualifying reason he or she is taking leave, and submit an oral or written statement that the employee is unable to work because of this reason, and provide other documentation outlined in section 826.100 of the Department's rule applying the FFCRA. While you may ask the employee to note any changed circumstances in his or her statement as part of explaining why the employee is unable to work, you should exercise caution in doing so, lest it increase the likelihood that any decision denying leave based on that information is a prohibited act. The fact that your employee has been teleworking despite having his or her children at home does not mean that the employee cannot now take leave to care for his or her children whose schools are closed for a COVID-19 related reason. For example, your employee may not have been able to care effectively for the children while teleworking or, perhaps, your employee may have made the decision to take paid sick leave or expanded family and medical leave to care for the children so that the employee's spouse, who is not eligible for any type of paid leave, could work or telework. These (and other) reasons are legitimate and do not afford a basis for denying paid sick leave or expanded family and medical leave to care for a child whose school is closed for a COVID-19 related reason.This does not prohibit you from disciplining an employee who unlawfully takes paid sick leave or expanded family and medical leave based on misrepresentations, including, for example, to care for the employee's children when the employee, in fact, has no children and is not taking care of a child. <SEP> ​My employees have been teleworking productively for some time without any issues. Now, several employees claim they need to take paid sick leave and expanded family and medical leave to care for their children, whose school is closed because of COVID-19, even though these employees have been teleworking with their children at home for some time. Can I ask my employees why they are now unable to work or if they have pursued alternative childcare arrangements? <EOS>
Please provide your manager with the Departmental guidance issued below. If your manager has any questions or needs any clarification, they can connect with their Labour Relations Officer.
An employee can request leave with pay for other reasons if:

They are a member of the vulnerable population;
They live with/care for a member of the vulnerable population;
They are experiencing child care challenges;
They are ready and able to work but their duties do not lend themselves to working remotely;
They have been diagnosed with or have a presumed case of Covid-19.

Of note, we expect that employees continue to adopt a good faith approach in using this leave, keeping in mind their important roles in providing services to the Defence Team. <SEP> I am a single parent working from home.

The screening process begins when you contact your provider or the MHS Nurse Advice Line to discuss your symptoms and it will begin with a series of questions. 
The nurse or staff member decides whether your symptoms may be due to COVID-19 or another illness requiring treatment. You might get advice on self-care since symptoms often can be treated at home.
The nurse/staff member may arrange a telephone visit between you and a health care provider or tell you to call your provider directly. The provider can talk with you about possible exposure, your symptoms, and discusses treatment. The provider may give you self-care advice to use at home. Or, he or she may tell you to go to your primary care clinic or emergency to be tested.
It’s important to call first so we can protect you, other patients, and medical staff from unnecessary exposure to COVID-19. <SEP> What’s the difference between testing and screening for COVID-19? Who gets what? <EOS>
Submitters must be willing and capable of collecting and packaging specimens, and either delivering them to a DCLS courier site or shipping them via commercial courier (e.g. FedEx). Upon collection, all specimens should be stored refrigerated and shipped to DCLS on ice packs to ensure refrigerated conditions. Specimens must arrive within 72 hours of collection under refrigerated conditions. If delayed shipping or longer storage is needed, samples should be stored at -70◦C and shipped on dry ice. <SEP> How do I prepare specimens for shipment to the Division of Consolidated Laboratory Services (DCLS) for testing, if the local health department determines that DCLS is appropriate for my sample? <EOS>
Paid COVID-19 School Leave runs concurrently with the first 2 weeks of unpaid EFMLA, if applicable, as described in HR/LR Policy # 1441, Expanded FMLA for COVID-19 Related School/Child Care. EFMLA is another use for FMLA leave. Employees who use COVID-19 School Leave/EFMLA will have that leave counted against/run concurrently with their FMLA bank for the fiscal year. 
For Paid COVID-19 Health Leave and Care Leave, if an employee is taking Paid COVID-19 Leave for a reason that also qualifies for FMLA leave and the employee is eligible for FMLA leave, the leave also constitutes FMLA leave, which runs concurrently with the Paid COVID-19 Leave. <SEP> Does FMLA run concurrently with Paid COVID-19 Leave/EFMLA?

 Disaster Household Distribution is a program designed to provide food directly to households in targeted areas to meet specific needs when traditional channels of food are unavailable and not being replenished on a regular basis, such as following a hurricane, tornado or other natural disaster. Under a Presidential Declaration of a National Emergency, as is currently in effect for the U.S., FNS may approve state and Tribal Nation requests for Disaster Household Distribution (DHD). DHD provides boxes of USDA Foods to households in need using existing inventories of USDA-purchased foods.

Early reports from China and France suggested that patients with severe symptoms of COVID-19 improved more quickly when given chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. Some doctors were using a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin with some positive effects.Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are primarily used to treat malaria and several inflammatory diseases, including lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. Azithromycin is a commonly prescribed antibiotic for strep throat and bacterial pneumonia. Both drugs are inexpensive and readily available.Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have been shown to kill the COVID-19 virus in the laboratory dish. The drugs appear to work through two mechanisms. First, they make it harder for the virus to attach itself to the cell, inhibiting the virus from entering the cell and multiplying within it. Second, if the virus does manage to get inside the cell, the drugs kill it before it can multiply.Azithromycin is never used for viral infections. However, this antibiotic does have some anti-inflammatory action. There has been speculation, though never proven, that azithromycin may help to dampen an overactive immune response to the COVID-19 infection.The jury is still out regarding whether these drugs, alone or in combination, can treat COVID-19 viral infection. While recent human studies suggest no benefit and possibly a higher risk of death due to lethal heart rhythm abnormalities, two studies supporting these conclusions have been retracted by the authors because of irregularities in how results were collected and analyzed.Regarding the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine alone to prevent coronavirus infection, the results of a clinical trial just published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that it did not prevent infection. However, how this study was conducted has been questioned by some experts.Where does that leave us? The recommendation has not changed. Chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin should not be used to prevent or treat COVID-19 infection unless it is being prescribed in the hospital or as part of a clinical trial.Clinical trials that were ongoing and about to be started to evaluate the effectiveness of these drugs are resuming. <SEP> Are chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin safe and effective for treating COVID-19? <EOS>

Scientists all over the world are testing whether drugs previously developed to treat other viral infections might also be effective against the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19.One drug that has received a lot of attention is the antiviral drug remdesivir. That's because the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is similar to the coronaviruses that caused the diseases SARS and MERS — and evidence from laboratory and animal studies suggests that remdesivir may help limit the reproduction and spread of these viruses in the body. In particular, there is a critical part of all three viruses that can be targeted by drugs. That critical part, which makes an important enzyme that the virus needs to reproduce, is virtually identical in all three coronaviruses; drugs like remdesivir that successfully hit that target in the viruses that cause SARS and MERS are likely to work against the COVID-19 virus.Remdesivir was developed to treat several other severe viral diseases, including the disease caused by Ebola virus (not a coronavirus). It works by inhibiting the ability of the coronavirus to reproduce and make copies of itself: if it can't reproduce, it can't make copies that spread and infect other cells and other parts of the body.Remdesivir inhibited the ability of the coronaviruses that cause SARS and MERS to infect cells in a laboratory dish. The drug also was effective in treating these coronaviruses in animals: there was a reduction in the amount of virus in the body, and also an improvement in lung disease caused by the virus.The drug appears to be effective in the laboratory dish, in protecting cells against infection by the COVID virus (as is true of the SARS and MERS coronaviruses), but more studies are underway to confirm that this is true.Human studies are also underway. A study from China published in The Lancet found that patients with symptom duration of 10 days or less who were treated with remdesivir had slightly faster time to clinical improvement compared to patients who received a placebo. But the differences were not considered significant.However, a well-designed study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine in May 2020, had more promising results. In comparing remdesivir to a placebo in more than 1,000 people hospitalized with COVID-19, it found that patients who received remdesivir recovered more quickly than those taking a placebo (a median of 11 days for remdesivir compared to a median of 15 days for placebo). This was a statistically significant difference. Remdesivir was less effective in sicker COVID-19 patients, including those on a ventilator or on a heart-lung machine. Questions remain, including whether remdesivir reduces the risk of dying from COVID-19.In early May, the FDA approved emergency use authorization for remdesivir in adults and children hospitalized with severe COVID-19 illness. <SEP> Is the antiviral drug remdesivir effective for treating COVID-19? <EOS>
Research is currently underway to understand the impacts of COVID 19 infection on pregnant women. Data are limited, but at present there is no evidence that they are at higher risk of severe illness than the general population. However, due to changes in their bodies and immune systems, we know that pregnant women can be badly affected by some respiratory infections. It is therefore important that they take precautions to protect themselves against COVID-19, and report possible symptoms (including fever, cough or difficulty breathing) to their healthcare provider.WHO will continue to review and update its information and advice as more evidence becomes available. <SEP> Are pregnant women at higher risk from COVID-19? <EOS>
Antibodies (also called immunoglobulins) are proteins made by
               the immune system. Their job is to recognize

No. At a restaurant or other establishment that provides outdoor food service, all customers sharing a table must
        be from the same household. This is because removing your face covering to eat and drink creates a risk of
    COVID-19 transmission, so it is not safe to do while sitting close at the same table for an extended period of time
    with people who are not from your own household. Outdoor dining establishments are required to tell you when they
    take your reservation that you can share a table only with members of your own household, and you must comply with
    that requirement if you go. The Health Officer’s Mandatory

Losing someone close to you is always hard, whatever the cause. During these extraordinary circumstances, when your usual routine may be disrupted and when funerals may not be permitted, it may be even harder. Following this advice may help. Do not criticise yourself for how you feel. When you lose a family member or friend to COVID-19, you may experience a range of emotions.  You may also have difficulty sleeping or low levels of energy. All these feelings are normal
        and there is no right or wrong way to feel grief. Allow yourself time to process your emotions in response to your loss. You may think that the sadness and pain that you feel will never go away, but in most cases, these feelings lessen over time. Talk regularly with people that you trust about your feelings. Keep to your routines as much as you feel able and try to focus on activities that bring you joy. Seek advice and comfort from people that you trust (e.g. religious/faith leaders, mental health workers or other trusted members of your community) while maintaining physical distance (e.g. attending virtual mass).    Think of alternative ways to say goodbye to the person who passed away such as writing a letter or dedicating a drawing to your loved one.

A recent study from infectious disease experts at Imperial College London in the United Kingdom modeled how things might evolve depending on what measures governments take now. These models predict that aggressive suppression measures, such as isolation of infected people and their family members, and physical distancing of the entire population, including potential business and school closures, will need to be maintained until a vaccine is developed.
Even if these measures are effective in reducing the spread of the virus, transmission of it is likely to increase as soon as the suppression measures are relaxed. The Imperial College study indicates that it may be possible to periodically relax the suppression measures, but that they will then need to be re-introduced as cases of infection begin to rise again. This cycle would continue until a vaccine is available.
However, research is still ongoing, and many open questions remain about how the pandemic will evolve over time. We will gain new insights, for example, as countries that used suppression measures during the height of their outbreaks (such as China) begin to relax those measures, and we see whether the suppression is effective longer-term, or if cases begin to rebound more quickly.

The FDA encourages such laboratories developing diagnostic tests to consider the validation recommendations in the guidance as they seek to validate their tests. If you pursue an alternate approach, we recommend discussing plans with us early, through the pre-EUA program. Please contact us at CDRH-EUA-Templates@fda.hhs.gov.
As noted in the guidance, once your test is validated and you are ready to begin clinical testing, labs should notify the FDA at CDRH-EUA-Templates@fda.hhs.gov and provide the name of the lab, lab director, address, and contact person. In the guidance, we recommend that you confirm the first five positive and the first five negative samples with an EUA-authorized test and include in your test report a statement that the FDA review of the validation is pending.
As stated in the guidance, the FDA does not intend to object to the use of validated diagnostic tests for specimen testing for a reasonable period of time after validation while the laboratory is preparing an EUA request. The FDA believes 15 business days is a reasonable period of time to prepare an EUA submission for a diagnostic test that has already been validated.
We strongly encourage laboratories testing under this policy to contact their state public health department as early as possible in the process (perhaps even before receipt of any orders or samples) to help ensure they have capacity for the validation testing described in the guidance and have the information necessary to support case investigations. We also encourage laboratories to be sure they are familiar with state and local laws mandating reporting of diseases and conditions of public health significance. <SEP>  I am a clinical laboratory certified to perform high-complexity testing under CLIA.

 Some regulations restrict  licensees to a certain percentage of self-study for continuing education  requirements. In response to the evolving situation with the Novel Coronavirus  (COVID-19), and for those licensees whose registrations are due to renew March  1, 2020 – May 1, 2021, the Department will grant an adjustment to all licensees  to complete up to 100% of the continuing education as self-study, provided that it is taken from a  Department-approved provider and is in an acceptable subject area for the  specific profession. 

Additionally, the Department will grant an adjustment to all  licensees, regardless of registration renewal date, to utilize self-study for  any coursework taken during the period from March 1, 2020 – May 1, 2021, provided  that it is taken from a Department-approved provider and is in an acceptable  subject area for the specific profession.  Coursework taken outside that  timeframe must meet the continuing education requirements in each individual  profession’s laws and regulations.

The COVID-19 pandemic is posing an unprecedented threat to the EU/EEA countries and the UK, which have been experiencing widespread transmission of the virus in the community for several weeks. In addition, there has been an increasing number of reports of COVID-19 outbreaks in long-term care homes across Europe with high associated mortality, highlighting the extreme vulnerability of the elderly in this setting.
The absence of an effective treatment or a vaccine combined with an exponential growth in infections from late February led many countries to implement non-pharmaceutical interventions such as “stay-at-home” policies (recommended or enforced), jointly with other community and physical distancing measures such as the cancellation of mass gatherings, closure of educational institutions and public spaces. <SEP> 1. What is the situation in Europe at the moment? <EOS>

People with moderate to severe asthma, particularly if not well controlled, might be at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19.
Based on what we currently know about COVID-19, the selection of therapeutic options through guideline-recommended treatment of asthma has not been affected. National asthma guidelinesexternal icon are available. Continuation of inhaled corticosteroids is particularly important for patients already using these medications because there is no evidence of increased risk of COVID-19 morbidity with use of inhaled corticosteroids and an abundance of data showing reduced risk of asthma exacerbation with maintenance of asthma controller therapy.
Patients with asthma but without symptoms or a diagnosis of COVID-19 should continue any required nebulizer treatments. <SEP> If I have patients with asthma, do I need to make any changes to their daily asthma preventive management regimens to reduce their risk of getting sick with COVID-19? <EOS>
 On July 20, 2020, FDA issued the Enforcement Policy for Viral Transport Media During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Public Health Emergency, to help address transport media availability concerns resulting from the COVID-19 public health emergency. Additional information about the policies in this guidance can be found on FDA's FAQs on Viral Transport Media During COVID-19 webpage.
We note that, as outlined in the Policy for Coronavirus Disease-2019 Tests, FDA does not intend to object to the use of a test, without notification to FDA or a new or amended EUA, where the test is a modification (other than a new specimen type modification) of an EUA-authorized test and the modified test is validated using a bridging study to the EUA-authorized test. (Note that such modifications are generally outside the scope of the EUA and are not authorized under the EUA.) This policy does not apply to home collection of specimens.
The FAQs in this section explain FDA's guidance policy on VTM and, along with the Testing Supply Substitution Strategies slides, provide additional information about validated supply alternatives for labs to perform testing when there is a supply issue with some components of a molecular test. Download the slide show file (PPT - 1.5MB) and click Slide Show > From Beginning. (Release date: July 23, 2020)
The factual information in these slides and FAQs is being provided in the context of limited quantities of testing supplies during this public health crisis, based on the best available evidence at this time and in consultation with outside experts.
We note that the information below provided about testing supply alternatives is not intended to alter any already issued EUA for a COVID-19 diagnostic test nor is it intended to speak to any specific FDA regulatory requirement. Rather, as stated above, the information is being provided to help address availability concerns regarding certain critical components of COVID-19 diagnostic tests during this pandemic. <SEP>  I am having trouble obtaining testing supplies for specimen collection, transport, and testing.

Generally, workers are required to wear a face covering at all times when indoors, when outdoors in situations where social distancing cannot be maintained, or when specific industry guidance has stricter requirements. Please see the Stay Safe Guidance for Businesses and Organizations to find information about specific work industries. Industry-specific requirements that differ from or impose greater requirements than the Executive Order are also summarized at Face Covering Requirements and Recommendations under Executive Order 20-81. Businesses are responsible for clearly communicating the applicable requirements to their workers. 
The Executive Order also identifies a number of situations where a face covering may be temporarily removed, such as when a worker is working alone (for example, when in an office, a cubicle with walls above face height when social distancing is maintained, or other enclosed space with no other individuals present). In addition, if a worker cannot wear a face covering due to a medical condition, mental health condition, or disability, a business must provide an accommodation to the worker if possible. <SEP> What are the requirements for face coverings at work? <EOS>
Your local health department will work with your facility to conduct an exposure risk assessment of potentially exposed healthcare personnel (HCP), based on CDC guidance.
Exposure risk depends on a variety of factors, including if the patient was wearing a mask, duration of contact with the patient, type of interaction, and PPE worn by the health care provider (HCP). HCPs not using all recommended PPE, who have only brief interactions with a patient, regardless of whether the patient was wearing a facemask, are considered low-risk. <SEP> What if my small practice has a patient who is diagnosed with COVID-19?

In a context of widespread restriction of movement of the population in response to the pandemic and isolation of COVID-19 patients, communication with the healthcare services should be maintained so that people with tuberculosis (TB), especially those most vulnerable, get essential services. This includes management of adverse drug reactions and co-morbidities, nutritional and mental health support, and restocking of the supplies of medicines. Enough TB medicines will need to be dispensed to the patient or caregiver to last until the next visit. This will limit interruption or unnecessary visits to the clinic. Mechanisms to deliver medicines at home and even to collect specimens for follow-up testing may become expedient. Home-based TB treatment is bound to become more common. Alternative arrangements to reduce clinic visits may involve limiting appointments to specific times to avoid exposure to other clinic attendees; using digital technologies to maintain treatment support. Community health workers become more critical as treatment is more decentralized.More TB patients will probably start their treatment at home and therefore limiting the risk of household transmission of TB during the first few weeks is important. Vulnerable populations who have poor access to healthcare should not get further marginalized during the pandemic. <SEP> How can we protect people seeking tuberculosis care during the COVID-19 pandemic? <EOS>

Honestly, the first step is to acknowledge this is totally bonkers. The writer Deb Perelman, who created the food blog Smitten Kitchen, laid it out plainly in her essay: "In the Covid-19 Economy, You Can Have a Kid or a Job. You Can’t Have Both.” 
“Why are we not hearing a primal scream so deafening that no plodding policy can be implemented without addressing the people buried by it?” she asks. 
There are a few strategies to try. Most importantly, work with your partner and present a united front. Division will create disorder, which will create chaos, which will drive you all up the wall. 
However you can, try to create boundaries. That might be a physical boundary (“This is the adult room”) or a time boundary (“You are not allowed to talk to Daddy until 2 p.m. today”). To do that, you might need to use time more effectively — sleep whenever you can and use noise-canceling technology, if need be. Having a daily schedule also helps.
But most important, be kind to yourself, and to one another. This is not like anything that has ever happened before. That’s OK. If the kids are spending more time on their screens, or if you’re not whipping up super healthy organic meals every night, whatever. You’re getting through it, and you’re loving one another. That’s what counts, right? <SEP> My partner and I both work from home, and now both parent from home. What should we do? <EOS>

The ethical basis for deciding which individuals or groups might be prioritized, including the principles to be applied, are presented in the below table:Ethical considerations when deciding who to prioritizePrincipleDescriptionPractice implicationEqualityEach person’s interest should count equally unless there are good reasons that justify the differential prioritization of resources.
                Irrelevant characteristics of individuals, such as race, ethnicity, creed, ability or gender, should not serve arbitrarily as the basis for the differential allocation of resources.
                This principle can be used to justify the allocation of resources by a lottery – that is, randomly by chance – or by a system of first come, first served. May be most appropriate to guide the allocation of scarce resources among individuals or populations who can be expected to derive the same benefit from the resource, for example, vaccines among high-risk populations, or ventilators among
                    those with similar clinical indicators for benefit.Best outcomes (utility)This principle can be used to justify the allocation of resources according to their capacity to do the most good or minimize the most harm, for example, using available resources to save the most lives possible.
                May be most appropriate to guide the allocation of scarce resources that confer substantially different benefits to different individuals, for example, ventilators to those expected to derive the most benefit.Prioritize the worst offThis principle can be used to justify the allocation of resources to those in greatest medical need or those most at risk.May be most appropriate to guide the allocation of resources that are designed or intended to protect those at risk, for example, PPE for health care workers, vaccines for those most at risk of infection and severe illness, or those most
                    in need, as in the case of provision of drugs in short supply to those needing them most urgently.Prioritize those tasked with helping othersThis principle can be used to justify the allocation of resources to those who have certain skills or talents that can save many other people, or because something is owed to them on account of their participation in helping others.May be most appropriate to guide the allocation of resources to health care workers, first responders, etc.Allocation principles may be relevant or justified at different stages of resource scarcity (from less scarcity to more scarcity). For example, where little scarcity exists, the allocation of resources such as ventilators may be most justified by the
    principle of first come, first served (which promotes the value of equality). When those resources become increasingly scarce, their allocation may be justified according to a principle that prioritizes those most in need. With even greater scarcity,
    a principle that aims to maximize benefit from the resource may be most justified. At each stage, allocation should aim to promote equality – that is, first come, first served, or random allocation, when no relevant factors distinguish individuals
    within a particular scheme of allocation (for example, among those with similar needs, or among those who can be expected to benefit similarly from the resources, or among those that are at similar levels of risk).In addition, multiple principles may be combined within an allocation scheme. For example, an allocation scheme for PPE might find its justification in a principle prioritizing those most at risk as well as a principle prioritizing those tasked with helping
    others, which would support priority allocation of PPE to health care workers. <SEP> What is the basis for deciding who should have priority access to scarce resources? <EOS>
WHO recommends keeping a physical distance of at least 1 metre between each person in all settings, including in workplaces. Because transmission can occur in crowded workplaces, WHO recommends providing sufficient space, at least 10 square meters, for every worker. National recommendations for physical distancing may require greater physical distance and should be complied with. In order to support compliance with national or local recommendations, implement physical distance guidelines in a way that is practical and feasible in the context of work tasks, and which is acceptable to both workers and employers. Stimulate workers to comply with physical distancing norms also at events outside the workplace, in the community, and in dormitories. Risk assessment and consultation between employers and workers is very important for setting up and implementing physical distancing measures at the workplace. This may require modification of workstations, changing the use of common spaces and transport vehicles, staggered work shifts, split teams and other measures to reduce social mixing at the workplace. If physical distancing measures at the workplace are not feasible for specific work tasks, consider whether the work can be suspended, and if this is not possible, apply additional protective measures, such as the use of screens, sneeze guards,  face masks, enhanced hand hygiene, ventilation and disinfection.Physical distancing alone can’t prevent COVID-19 transmission, it is important that it is combined with other public health measures, such as hand and respiratory hygiene, environmental clean-up and disinfection of commonly touched surfaces and objects, ventilation, wearing face masks and a policy of staying at home if unwell. <SEP> What should be taken into consideration when setting a physical distance at the workplace? <EOS>

Q. Do you have best practices to share with retail food stores, restaurants, and food pick-up and delivery services that cover safe food handling, as well as employee health? - added April 16, 2020
FDA is sharing information about best practices to operate retail food stores, restaurants, and associated pick-up and delivery services during the COVID-19 pandemic to safeguard workers and consumers. The information in two convenient formats addresses key considerations for how foods offered at retail and restaurants can be safely handled and delivered to the public, as well as key best practices for employee health, cleaning and sanitizing, and personal protective equipment (PPE). See Best Practices for Retail Food Stores, Restaurants, and Food Pick-Up/Delivery Services During the COVID-19 Pandemic.
Q: How do I maintain social distancing in my animal food production/processing facility and food retail establishment where employees typically work within close distances? - updated 4/6/2020
To prevent spread of COVID-19, CDC is recommending individuals employ social distancing or maintaining approximately 6 feet from others, when possible. In animal food production/processing facilities and retail food establishments, an evaluation should be made to identify and implement operational changes that increase employee separation. However, social distancing to the full 6 feet will not be possible in some animal food facilities.
The risk of an employee transmitting COVID-19 to another is dependent on distance between employees, the duration of the exposure, and the effectiveness of employee hygiene practices and sanitation. When it’s impractical for employees in these settings to maintain social distancing, effective hygiene practices should be maintained to reduce the chance of spreading the virus. Also, see Should Employees in animal food production and retail settings and delivery staff for home-based delivery services wear face coverings to prevent exposure to COVID-19?
IMPORTANT: Maintaining social distancing in the absence of effective hygiene practices may not prevent the spread of this virus. Animal food facilities should be vigilant in their hygiene practices, including frequent and proper hand-washing and routine cleaning of surfaces that workers commonly touch or contact. 
Because the intensity of the COVID-19 outbreak may differ according to geographic location, coordination with state and local officials is strongly encouraged for all businesses so that timely and accurate information can guide appropriate responses in each location where their operations reside.  
Sick employees should follow the CDC’s What to do if you are sick with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Q: Should employees, such as cashiers, baggers, and cleaning personnel in animal food production and retail settings (such as pet stores or farm supply stores) and delivery staff for home-based delivery services, wear face coverings to prevent exposure to COVID-19? - updated 4/24/2020
On April 3, the CDC released an updated recommendation regarding the use of cloth face coverings to help slow the spread of COVID-19.  CDC recommends the use of simple cloth face coverings as a voluntary public health measure in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies). 
For workers on farms, and in food production, processing, and retail settings who do not typically wear masks as part of their jobs, consider the following if you choose to use a cloth face covering to slow the spread of COVID-19:
Maintain face coverings in accordance with parameters in FDA’s Model Food Code sections 4-801.11 Clean Linens and 4-802.11 Specifications.
Launder reusable face coverings before each daily use.
CDC also has additional information on the use of face coverings, including washing instructions and information on how to make homemade face covers.
NOTE:  The cloth face coverings recommended by CDC are not surgical masks or N-95 respirators.  Those are critical supplies that must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.
In addition, FDA has developed a fact sheet to provide helpful information to the human and animal food industries on the Use of Respirators, Facemasks, and Cloth Face Coverings in the Food and Agriculture Sector During Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic (last updated 4/24/20).
Q: What steps can I take to clean my animal food facility/equipment to prevent the spread of COVID-19?
Some steps that can be taken to clean a facility or equipment to prevent the spread of COVID-19 include:
Following current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements for animal food safety to maintain clean surfaces.
While not universally required under the CGMPs in the Preventive Controls for Animal Food (PCAF) regulation, consider sanitizing high-contact surfaces and equipment that workers may come into contact with.
See:  FSMA Final Rule for Preventive Controls for Animal Food.
Human food facilities are required to use EPA-registered “sanitizer” products in their cleaning and sanitizing practices. Cleaning and sanitizing agents used in animal food production must be safe and adequate under the conditions for use.  Using the EPA-registered sanitizers may be one means of helping ensure safety and adequacy.
In addition, there is a list of EPA-registered “disinfectant” products for COVID-19 on the Disinfectants for Use Against SARS-CoV-2 list that have qualified under EPA’s emerging viral pathogen program for use against SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. 
IMPORTANT: Check the product label guidelines for if and where these disinfectant products are safe and recommended for use in food manufacturing areas or food establishments. 
We encourage coordination with localExternal Link Disclaimer health officials for all businesses so that timely and accurate information can guide appropriate responses in each location where their operations reside.
Animal food facilities may want to consider a more frequent cleaning schedule.
Q: Are workers in the animal food (including for livestock and pet animals) sector considered part of the essential critical infrastructure workforce?
Yes, in a guidance last updated by Department of Homeland Security on March 28, Guidance on the Essential Critical Infrastructure Workforce: Ensuring Community and National Resilience in COVID-19 Response, workers in the Food and Agriculture sector – agricultural production, food processing, distribution, retail and food service and allied industries – are named as essential critical infrastructure workers. Promoting the ability of American workers within the food and agriculture industry to continue to work during periods of community restrictions, social distances, and closure orders, among others, is crucial to community continuity and community resilience.
Q: Where should I send questions if we are having problems moving animal food/ingredients or getting animal food/ingredients through areas that have curfews and restrictions because of the coronavirus?
If you are experiencing issues regarding your supply chain, delivery of goods, or business continuity, please contact the FEMA National Business Emergency Operations Center at NBEOC@fema.dhs.gov. This is a 24/7 operation and they can assist in directing your inquiry to the proper contact. 
Q: Will FDA/EPA approve off-label use of quaternary ammonium sanitizer at 200 ppm as a hand sanitizer for checkers and customers?  It is currently on the EPA approved list for use in retail to sanitize food prep areas, dishes etc., and we would like to use it instead of gel hand sanitizer due to the lack of availability.
We are aware of temporary out-of-stock conditions of alcohol-based hand sanitizers.  Several manufacturers of these products have indicated that they are working to replenish supplies.  In addition, the FDA has issued guidance for the temporary compounding of certain alcohol-based hand sanitizers by pharmacists in state-licensed pharmacies or federal facilities and registered outsourcing facilities.  See Immediately in Effect Guidance for Industry: Policy for Temporary Compounding of Certain Alcohol-Based Hand Sanitizer Products During the Public Health Emergency.  FDA has also issued guidance for the temporary preparation of certain alcohol-based hand sanitizer products by firms during the public health emergency (COVID-19).  See Guidance for Industry: Temporary Policy for Preparation of Certain Alcohol-Based Hand Sanitizer Products During the Public Health Emergency (COVID-19).
Hand sanitizers are not intended to replace handwashing in food production and retail settings.  Instead, hand sanitizers may be used in addition to or in combination with proper handwashing.  CDC recommends that everyone wash their hands with plain soap and water. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers may be used if plain soap and water are not available.
As an interim measure, we understand some food establishments have set up quaternary ammonium hand-dip stations and sprays at 200 ppm concentration. These products are intended for use on surfaces, and as such, may not be formulated for use on skin. FDA is aware of adverse event reports from consumers using such products as a replacement for hand sanitizers and advises against using these products as replacements for hand sanitizers. <SEP> Social Distancing & Business Operations During the COVID-19 Pandemic <EOS>

choosing a babysitter who has minimal exposures to other people besides your family
limiting the number of babysitters. If you can keep it to one, that’s ideal. But if you need multple babysitters, keep the number as low as possible
making sure the babysitter understands he or she needs to practice social distancing and limits physical interaction with your children as much as possible

making sure everyone washes their hands frequently throughout the day, especially before eating. <SEP> We need a babysitter. How do I keep my family safe with someone new in the house? <EOS>
Yes, this order lifts the statewide Stay at Home Order and moves the state to a Safer At Home recommendation. It is important to stay home if you are sick. While in public, people should wear a cloth face covering, practice social distancing by waiting 6 feet apart from others while in public and wash their hands or use hand sanitizer. High-risk individuals are urged to stay at home and travel only for absolutely essential purposes. The CDC defines high-risk individuals as:
People 65 years or older
People of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions, including people who are immunocompromised or who have chronic lung disease, moderate-to-severe asthma, serious heart conditions, severe obesity, diabetes, chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis or liver disease <SEP> Does this Order lift the Governor’s Stay at Home Order? <EOS>
Gatherings of more than 10 people in a single indoor space remains prohibited. In confined outdoor spaces, gatherings of more than 25 people are prohibited. These mass gathering limits include parades, fairs, festivals, auditoriums, stadiums, arenas, conference rooms and meeting halls.
Outlined in Executive Order 151, parties and receptions, like all other private events or convenings which are not excepted from the prohibition on mass gatherings, are restricted to the mass gathering limit. This limit applies regardless whether the event takes place in a restaurant, in a conference center, in a hotel ballroom, in a venue that is used exclusively for receptions or parties, or in some other space open under this Executive Order.
The prohibition on mass gatherings does not include gatherings for health and safety, looking for and obtaining goods and services, working or for receiving governmental services.
A mass gathering does not include normal operations at airports, bus and train stations or stops, medical facilities, libraries, shopping malls and shopping centers.
It also does not apply to the exercise of First Amendment rights, such as the right to attend a worship service. However, in these settings, people are strongly encouraged to follow the Three Ws (Wear a face covering, Wash hands and Wait six feet apart from others), and should avoid congregating in groups. <SEP> What is the mass gathering limit? <EOS>
Yes, under certain circumstances, restricting residents to their rooms is recommended (not mandated).  According to the CDC guidance document (dated March 21, 2020) “Preparing for COVID-19: Long-term Care Facilities, Nursing Homes,” this type of restriction would apply to care of residents with an undiagnosed respiratory illness, or care of symptomatic residents who are awaiting transport to a facility that can provide a higher level of care which the patient needs.  Residents diagnosed with, or suspected to have, COVID-19 are recommended to be isolated in their room(s) with the door closed, to the extent possible.  If there are cases of COVID-19 in the facility OR if there is widespread transmission of the virus in the community, residents who have not been diagnosed with COVID-19 are encouraged to be restricted to their rooms to the extent possible.  If residents leave their rooms, they should wear a facemask, practice social distancing and good hand hygiene.  Residents who leave their rooms can be redirected back to their rooms. It may be helpful to engage the resident in light exercise in the facility – this may reduce restlessness, agitation and wandering. <SEP> Is it appropriate for long-term care facilities to restrict residents to their rooms because of COVID-19?

Unlike the four strains of coronavirus behind about 20% of the cases of common cold, COVID-19 virus can cause severe illness, and even death. This is because while coronaviruses causing the common cold infect the nose and throat, which comprise the upper respiratory tract, COVID-19 virus infects the lungs, which is the lower respiratory tract. That can bring on pneumonia.

 Medical gloves were designed to serve as protective barriers and may still offer some protection even when they are used beyond the manufacturer’s designated shelf life or expiration date. The user should inspect all gloves prior to use and if there are concerns such as discoloration, visible holes or tears, the product should be discarded. As a conventional capacity strategy, it is preferred that expired gloves are used where barrier protection is not needed. <SEP>  Can we use expired medical gloves?

People in correctional and detention facilities are at greater risk for some illnesses, such as COVID-19, because of close living arrangements with other people. The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person, through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or be launched into the air and inhaled into someone’s lungs. It is possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or eyes; however, this is not the most likely way the virus spreads. <SEP> Do I have a greater chance of getting COVID-19? <EOS>

No. Medical masks, including surgical masks, are routinely worn by healthcare workers throughout  the day as part of their personal protective equipment (PPE) ensembles and do not compromise their oxygen levels or cause carbon dioxide buildup. They are designed to be breathed through and can protect against respiratory droplets, which are typically much larger than tiny carbon dioxide particles. Consequently, most carbon dioxide particles will either go through the mask or escape along the mask's loose-fitting perimeter. Some carbon dioxide might collect between the mask and the wearer's face, but not at unsafe levels.
Like medical masks, cloth face coverings are loose-fitting with no seal and are designed to be breathed through. In addition, workers may easily remove their medical masks or cloth face coverings periodically (and when not in close proximity with others) to eliminate any negligible build-up of carbon dioxide that might occur. Cloth face coverings and medical masks can help prevent the spread of potentially infectious respiratory droplets from the wearer to their co-workers, including when the wearer has COVID-19 and does not know it.
Some people have mistakenly claimed that OSHA standards (e.g., the Respiratory Protection standard, 29 CFR 1910.134; the Permit-Required Confined Space standard 29 CFR 1910.146; and the Air Contaminants standard, 29 CFR 1910.1000) apply to the issue of oxygen or carbon dioxide levels resulting  from the use of medical masks or cloth face coverings in work settings with  normal ambient air (e.g. healthcare settings, offices, retail settings,  construction). These standards do not apply to the wearing of medical masks or  cloth face coverings in work settings with normal ambient air). These standards  would only apply to work settings where there are known or suspected sources of  chemicals (e.g., manufacturing facilities) or workers are required to enter a  potentially dangerous location (e.g., a large tank or vessel). <SEP> Does wearing a medical/surgical mask or cloth face covering cause unsafe oxygen levels or harmful carbon dioxide levels to the wearer? <EOS>
Health care workers (caring for patients) and first responders can justifiably be
prioritized when allocating some resources because of their contribution to the health
and well-being of the community. Their health helps preserve the health of others.Participants of research aimed at developing vaccines, therapies or other critical
resources should receive some priority in receiving those resources because they have
also helped save others by their participation. This is not an absolute priority – for
example, it should not take precedence over giving priority to those most at risk in the
case of resources such as vaccines.While the principle of first come, first served is often applied when allocating
resources in health care settings, it is rarely appropriate in an emergency. In practice,
it is very likely to favour certain groups, such as those closest to a distribution centre,
those with access to better information, or those who are most well-off.Younger populations appear to be at lower risk in the COVID-19 context.
Consequently, the principle of youngest first should have low priority for vaccine, but
perhaps may have more weight if they do become sick and need critical care
resources.The allocation of different resources may find ethical justification in different
principles or values. For instance, if a novel vaccine is found to be safe and effective,
a lottery-based allocation may be justified among those as highest risk, the old and
those with co-morbidities, if they outnumber available vaccines.Maximizing utility should be balanced with the principle of priority to the worst-off:
centralizing the availability of resources in larger centres may extend their benefits to
more people, but may exclude isolated populations and challenge our concern for
those at highest risk. <SEP> What conclusions can we draw about the fair allocation of scarce resources within countries during the COVID-19 outbreak? <EOS>
Symptoms can appear anywhere from 2-14 days after exposure. Symptoms consist of fever, coughing, and shortness of breath. If any of those symptoms occur, call your doctor to discuss next steps or get tested at any of the 250 testing sites across New Jersey.

While the shedding profile of SARS-CoV-2 continues to be studied, it is believed that asymptomatic people infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus are able to transmit this to other people. If similar to other coronaviruses, viral shedding may occur before and after onset of symptoms. For this reason, a close contact is defined as being within 6 feet of a person with COVID-19 for at least 15 minutes or having exposure to the person’s respiratory secretions (for example, being coughed or sneezed on; sharing a drinking glass or utensils; kissing) while they were contagious. A person with COVID-19 is considered to be contagious starting from 2 days before they became sick (or 2 days before they tested positive if they never had symptoms) until they meet the criteria to discontinue isolation.
The quantity of virus shed before one becomes aware of symptoms is likely less than what is shed when one is sick, when respiratory secretions are more likely to contribute to transmission via coughing, sneezing or medical procedures.
It is very important that people with even mild signs of illness (fever, cough, chills,  muscle pain, sore throat, new loss of taste or smell) stay home to prevent spreading illness to others! 
All patients, even those with mild illness, should be provided with correct self-isolation guidance. See:

Yes, you can stay overnight in someone else’s home. However, you should ensure you maintain social distancing with anyone you do not live with or who is not in your support bubble. Take particular care to maintain excellent hygiene – washing hands and surfaces – and avoid using shared facilities like bathrooms wherever possible.

Some meat processing plants have shut down due to the COVID-19 outbreaks among workers, prompting a shortage of meat in grocery stores. However, these shutdowns are due to safety issues around viral spread between workers, not food safety.
Both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the World Health Organization state there is no evidence to suggest that food or food packaging has been a factor in the transmission of COVID-19. The U.S. FDA recommends that everyone follow the four key steps of food safety: clean, separate, cook, and chill.

All New  Yorkers should get a COVID-19 diagnostic test, whether or not they have  symptoms or are at increased risk. Tests are free. You should look  for a testing site near  your home.
If you  have already been tested and were found to be negative, you should get another test if:
				
You  have symptoms  of COVID-19.
You or  your provider is concerned by a possible exposure, such as:
						
Spending  time in large crowds
An  exposure to someone with confirmed or possible COVID-19
Breaches  in wearing a face covering or maintaining physical distancing


You  work in a residential congregate setting, such as a nursing home or shelter.
You are  planning to visit someone at highest risk for severe COVID-19 illness,  including people 65 or older and people with serious underlying medical  conditions.
						
Try to  maintain strict physical distancing and other precautions for at least 10 days  before you get tested. If you have had COVID-19 symptoms within the last 14  days, no matter how minor, postpone your visit.

You must follow the rules listed in the Mandatory Directive for
        Recreational and Athletic Activities and any rules issued by the State Health Officer. 
The following sports and recreation activities are not allowed at all: 

Any close contact sport played with people who are not members of your household. Close
        interactions with people from other households create too much risk of COVID-19 transmission.  This means you
        can’t play close contact sports (those that involve either physical contact or physical proximity of 6 feet
            or less)—like football, rugby, basketball, baseball, cricket, soccer, boxing and martial arts, partner
        and team dance, water polo, hockey, lacrosse, and ultimate frisbee—with people who are not from your own
        household. 

You can still do things like catch and throw a football or shoot hoops with a friend, because those versions
            of the game do not require close contact. 
You can also play any other sport or game with people from other households that doesn’t involve close
            contact (like tennis, bowling, running, or archery). 

Going to a pro sporting event as a spectator. Professional sports teams can train in their
        facilities, or hold games without any spectators present if the local Health Officer approves their
        facility-specific protocols, but you cannot attend a pro sports event as a spectator because allowing crowds at
        such events presents far too high a risk of COVID-19 transmission. 
Indoor swimming pools. The Order issued July 2 prohibits indoor activities that involve
        removing face coverings. This means that indoor swimming pools are closed.

Yes. However, viral culture is not widely performed for SARS-CoV-2. It must be conducted in Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) laboratories using BSL-3 practices by experienced virologists and culture results can take a week or more. Therefore, while persons whose specimens do not yield live virus are considered no longer infectious, the complexity of such testing and the time required to complete it mean that culture cannot be used routinely to guide management of infected persons. <SEP> Can viral culture be used to demonstrate that a person who had persistently or recurrently detectable viral RNA is not infectious to others? <EOS>

Social interactions are an important part of development throughout childhood, and spending time with peers is typically part of that process.

There is much to be gained from interactions with parents, siblings and even pets. Time alone is valuable, too. And connection through technology, like hanging out or playing games through video chats, can fill in some of the blanks.

There's a lot of confusion about data—even accurate data. As mayors, you're trying to help people understand the facts as best we know them. Explain that you’re working to get the most accurate information you can, and you will work to get errors corrected.
I would repeat over and over that you are offering your best understanding of the facts as you know them at a given moment. There's a lot of noise out there and you are a signal. You need to be a consistent signal, maintain your credibility, and use it as an educational resource for your community. Mayors, because of their political legitimacy, are in a very good position, maybe the best position, to perform this role. You're local and you're trusted. (Dutch Leonard, 5/29/20)
When people can't believe the numbers, that strikes at the heart of credibility and can really undermine confidence. This whole crisis response—without medicines, without a vaccine—is about helping people understand the truth so they can protect themselves and each other. It's a big crack in the wall if people don't believe the number of cases or the number of deaths. It undermines their ability to understand the important steps they need to take and why.
Given all this, you as mayors should be very strong calling for solid data—and audits if there's a problem—to make sure people are operating from the same set of facts. Be very clear, answer people’s questions, and try to get to the bottom of the mistakes. Acknowledge those mistakes and do what you can to retain credibility.

If you have symptoms, you would need a viral or swab test to confirm whether you have COVID-19. An antibody test alone cannot tell.

An N95 respirator with an exhalation valve does provide the same level of protection to the wearer as one that does not have a valve. The presence of an exhalation valve reduces exhalation resistance, which makes it easier to breathe or exhale. Some users feel that a respirator with an exhalation valve keeps the face cooler and reduces moisture build up inside the facepiece. However, respirators with exhalation valves should not be used in situations where a sterile field must be maintained (e.g., during an invasive procedure in an operating or procedure room) because the exhalation valve may allow unfiltered exhaled air to escape into the sterile field. If you only have a respirator with an exhalation valve available, cover the exhalation valve with a facemask (surgical or procedure mask) that does not interfere with the respirator fit.​ <SEP> My N95 respirator has an exhalation valve.

Most people who are infected with the COVID-19 virus produce antibodies, which are proteins that make it harder for the virus to infect cells. But antibodies are only one part of the body's immune response. T cells, for example, can destroy cells that are already infected. And memory B cells can quickly generate a strong antibody response to a virus the body has encountered before.Antibody levels typically fall once the immediate threat of infection declines. Several new studies have found that COVID-19 antibody levels decline, but then stabilize and remain in the blood even two to three months after infection. Other recent studies found COVID-specific B cells and T cells in the blood, months after people recovered. This all suggests that the immune system would be ready to react quickly and strongly if re-exposed to the COVID-19 virus.The laboratory evidence is promising. But the real evidence will come as more and more people who have recovered (rather than cells in a lab) are re-exposed to the virus.Researchers in Hong Kong recently reported the first confirmed case of reinfection with the COVID-19 virus. The man was first infected in March, then declared to be recovered after two negative coronavirus tests. Four and a half months later, he tested positive for coronavirus on a saliva screening test administered at the Hong Kong airport upon his return from a trip to Europe. Scientists sequenced viral genetic material from the man's two infections and found significant enough differences to suggest two separate infections.The man had experienced mild symptoms during his first infection and had no symptoms the second time he was infected. It's possible that while his immune system could not protect him against reinfection, it did help keep him from getting sicker during the second infection.It's far too early to make any generalizations. We cannot know from one case of reinfection (among tens of millions of people who have been infected) how strong an average immune response will be, or how long that immune response will last.It's also worth noting that someone who has been re-infected — even someone with no symptoms — has the potential to spread the virus to others. That means that everyone, even those who have recovered from coronavirus infection, should continue to wear masks and practice physical distancing. <SEP> Is a person who has been infected with coronavirus protected from becoming infected again? <EOS>

COVID-19 is primarily transmitted from person-to-person through respiratory droplets. These droplets (larger particles) and aerosols (smaller particles) are released when someone with COVID-19 sneezes, coughs, or talks. Current data do not support long range aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), such as seen with measles or tuberculosis. Short-range inhalation of aerosols is a possibility for COVID-19, as with many respiratory pathogens. However, this cannot easily be distinguished from “droplet” transmission based on epidemiologic patterns. Short-range transmission is a possibility, particularly in crowded and inadequately ventilated spaces. Certain medical procedures performed in healthcare facilities can also generate fine aerosols and should be avoided when possible.

There are two categories of serology tests: The ones that are done at CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments) certified labs, and then there are point of care tests done in offices or at pharmacies, many of which have not have full FDA reviews.
We know that tests done at CLIA-certified labs measure what they say they’re going to measure. These are FDA-approved tests are well-regulated, must be validated, there’s ongoing quality assurance, and they’re held to very high standards. These are federal requirements.  
Tests not done in those CLIA-certified labs don’t have those regulations, and have been pushed through on an emergency-use authorization. They’re not FDA- approved so there’s no way to know how good they are, if they’re differentiating the different types of coronaviruses, or if they’re measuring exposure to SARS-CoV-2 or not. False positives could go up if they’re checking for anything that looks like coronavirus. <SEP> What kinds of antibody (serology) tests are there? <EOS>
Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. However, it appears that the virus that causes COVID-19 can spread from people to animals after close contact with people with COVID-19.
Until we learn more about how this virus affects animals, use similar precautions for pets and other animals in your facility as you would for other people in your facility. This will help protect both people and pets in your facility from COVID-19.

Do not let pets in the facility interact with sick people.
Pets or other animals should not be allowed to roam freely around the facility.
Residents should avoid letting their pets interact with people as much as possible.
Dogs should be walked on a leash at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from others.
People sick with COVID-19 should avoid contact with pets and other animals.
Do not allow pets into common areas of the facility such as cafeterias and social areas.
Cats should be kept indoors to prevent them from interacting with other animals or people outside of the facility.

Talk to a veterinarian if a pet in your facility gets sick or if you have any concerns about the health of any pets in the facility. If you think a pet in the facility was exposed to or is showing signs consistent with COVID-19, contact your state health official to discuss guidance on testing pets or other animals for the virus that causes COVID-19.
People who are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 should avoid providing care for sick pets, if possible.

The Washington Department of Health requires anyone in Washington State to wear a cloth face covering in public when unable to stay 6 feet away from others.
You are directed to wear face coverings over your nose and mouth while in an indoor public setting where you may be within 6 feet of someone who does not live with you. You are also directed to wear a cloth face covering in an outdoor public setting – like a farmers market or a crowded park – where it is difficult to maintain six feet of physical distance at all times.
A face covering is not needed when you are outside walking, exercising, or otherwise outdoors if you are able to regularly stay 6 feet away from other people who do not live with you.
To protect yourself, wear face coverings properly. Your mask should cover your nose and mouth at all times. Always wash your hands with soap and water or use hand sanitizer before you put on a face covering and after removing it. Change your face covering when it gets moist. Wash your face covering after each use.

Manufacturing and warehousing businesses may remain open and must follow required social distancing and safety protocols detailed in Executive Order No. 122 and Executive Order No. 181.
What To Expect
The following summarizes some of the protocols contained in Executive Order No. 122 and Executive Order No. 181. However, this summary is not a replacement for fully complying with the terms of EO 122 and businesses should read the full guidance carefully to ensure full compliance.
Establishments must institute the following policies:

Require workers and visitors to wear cloth face coverings. A business must provide, at its own expense, these face coverings for employees. If a visitor refuses for a non-medical reason, they must be denied entry.
Businesses may adopt policies that require staff to wear gloves, in addition to regular hand hygiene. Where a business requires its staff to wear gloves while at the worksite, the business must provide such gloves to staff.
Prohibit non-essential visitors from the worksite;
Require everyone to maintain 6 feet of social distancing wherever possible;
Stagger lunch breaks and work times to minimize the number of people on site while safely continuing operations;
Restrict the number of individuals who can access common areas such as restrooms and breakrooms at the same time;
Require infection control practices such as regular hand washing, coughing and sneezing etiquette, and proper tissue usage;
Limit sharing of tools, equipment, and machinery;
Provide hand sanitizer and wipes to workers and visitors;
Require frequent sanitization of high-touch areas like restrooms, breakrooms, equipment, and machinery.
Immediately separate and send home workers who appear to have COVID-19 symptoms;
Promptly notify workers of any known exposure to COVID-19, subject to confidentiality requirements in the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)

Routine hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccination of children should continue to the extent possible, according to the CDC immunization schedules.
Maintaining Childhood Immunizations During COVID-19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic is changing rapidly and continues to affect communities across the United States differently. Some of the strategies used to slow the spread of disease in communities include postponing or cancelling non-urgent elective procedures and using telemedicine instead of face-to-face encounters for routine medical visits.
Different strategies are needed to ensure the delivery of newborn care and well-child care, including childhood immunizations. Healthcare providers in communities affected by COVID-19 are using strategies to separate well visits from sick visitsexternal icon. Examples include:

Scheduling well visits in the morning and sick visits in the afternoon.
Separating patients spatially, such as by placing patients with sick visits in different areas of the clinic or another location from patients with well visits.
Collaborating with providers in the community to identify separate locations for holding well visits for children.

Because of personal, practice, or community circumstances related to COVID-19, some providers may not be able to provide well-child care, including immunizations, for all patients in their practice. If a practice can provide only limited well-child visits, healthcare providers are encouraged to prioritize newborn care and vaccination of infants and young children (through 24 months of age) when possible. CDC is monitoring the situation and will continue to provide guidance. <SEP> Should routinely recommended hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccines continue to be administered to children? <EOS>

No. Your employer cannot fire you if you miss work because you had COVID-19 or were told to quarantine by a medical professional. You are also legally protected against discrimination or harassment when it comes to COVID-19.
Job Protections
The State of New Jersey has passed legislation that prohibits an employer -- during the ongoing Public Health Emergency and State of Emergency -- from terminating or refusing to reinstate an employee who has, or is likely to have, an infectious disease which requires the employee to miss time at work.
An employee who requests or takes time off from work, based on the recommendation of a medical professional, may not be terminated or refused reinstatement if the employee is likely to infect others in the workplace.
You can report a possible violation of this law through the New Jersey Department of Labor's Division of Wage and Hour Compliance in English or Spanish.
Civil Rights Protections
Under the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination (LAD), you are protected from discrimination and harassment based on actual or perceived race, national origin, religion, disability, and other protected characteristics in employment, housing, and places open to the public, including businesses, schools, medical providers, etc., including when the conduct at issue is related to COVID-19.
If you believe your civil rights were violated, file a complaint with your regional Division on Civil Rights office.
Employment
The LAD's protections in employment mean, for example, that your employer cannot fire you because you coughed at work and they perceived you to have COVID-19. And if you have east-Asian heritage and a coworker repeatedly harasses you by calling COVID-19 "the Chinese virus" or claiming that Chinese people "caused" COVID-19 or were responsible for spreading it, your employer must take reasonable action to stop the harassment if they knew or should have known about it. Finally, if your employer lays off workers because of COVID-19, they cannot select employees to lay off based on race, national origin, religion, age, disability, or any other LAD-protected characteristic.
You may be able to take job-protected leave under the New Jersey Family Leave Act (NJFLA), enforced by DCR, to care for a family member, or someone who is the equivalent of family, who has a serious health condition, including a diagnosis of COVID-19, or who has been isolated or quarantined because of suspected exposure to COVID-19. You may also be eligible to take job-protected leave to care for your child if their school or place of care was ordered closed due to COVID-19.
Places Open to the Public
Places of public accommodation, like stores and medical facilities, cannot discriminate based on race, disability, religion, gender identity or expression, or other LAD-protected characteristics in their provision of services. For example, it is unlawful for a medical facility to provide different levels of COVID-19 testing or treatment to Black and white patients because of their race. Additionally, retail stores cannot refuse entry to, remove, or otherwise treat differently a customer who cannot wear a mask because of a medical condition.
Housing
The prohibition on discrimination and bias-based harassment in housing means, for example, that a landlord cannot ask a tenant to move out because they have COVID-19 or because the landlord believes they have COVID-19. Similarly, a landlord cannot refuse to rent a property to you because you are Jewish and they say that Jewish people are responsible for spreading COVID-19.

 Food banks are private, non-profit entities who work in their local communities to gather donations and distribute foods to those in need who may not be accessing other assistance programs. FNS partners with food banks and other state distributing agencies by providing USDA foods through The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) and Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP). USDA has provided states broad discretion to set eligibility limits for TEFAP and ensured that states can take limited eligibility information such as name, address, and self-reported income via telephone, text or other electronic means, or by receiving a 1-page affidavit in a dropbox. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act, signed into law by President Trump on March 18, 2020 provided USDA an additional $400 million for TEFAP, up to $100 million of which can be used to help agencies cover costs associated with distributing a higher volume of food due to COVID-19. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, signed into law by President Trump on March 27, 2020 provided an additional $450 million for TEFAP. When a localized need is identified, such as disrupted food supply, food banks should check with their state agency regarding a Disaster Household Distribution program. <SEP>  How is the Food and Nutrition Service helping food banks during this public health emergency? <EOS>

To save supplies, especially in situations where resources are limited, and test more people, pooled testing may be implemented. Pooled testing means taking samples from multiple people, storing part of each sample individually, and combining the other part of each sample into batches, or pools, and then testing each pool. This allows many more people to be tested in an initial round of testing than tests that do not use pools, and then for any pool that indicates a positive result, the samples that contributed to that pool can be tested individually to identify the positive people.

Cloth face coverings do not impact VDH contact tracing efforts. We recognize that cloth face coverings have the potential to provide some protection, when used along with other daily protective activities such as physical distancing, hand hygiene, and cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces. However, we do not compare cloth face coverings as source control to surgical or other masks such as N95’s, that are designed as Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), to protect the wearer from splashes or sprays from blood or other body fluids or breathing or coughing. If you have been in contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19, even while wearing a cloth face covering, you may still be contacted by VDH. <SEP> Does wearing a cloth face covering impact contact tracing? <EOS>
Although it is unknown if mothers with COVID-19 can transmit the virus via breast milk, the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) encourage all mothers who wish to breastfeed their babies to do so. 
In limited studies that included women with another coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the virus was not detected in breast milk. And in China, a group of six mothers who tested positive for COVID-19 were studied after giving birth. Findings from the study, recently published in The Lancet, showed no evidence of the coronavirus in the mothers’ breast milk or in the cord blood, amniotic fluid or throat swabs of their newborns. 
Despite the anxiety around this issue, Amanda Reyes, IBCLC, an International Board-certified Lactation Consultant at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, has not seen an increase in parents weaning earlier since the COVID-19 outbreak.  
“Breastfeeding parents continue to experience the same challenges and obstacles as they did pre-COVID-19,” Reyes says. “With all the uncertainty, it is strongly encouraged for parents to continue to breastfeed their child.”  
A breastfeeding mother who has symptoms of the novel coronavirus or tests positive for COVID-19 should take all possible precautions to avoid spreading the virus to the infant by following these CDC guidelines: 

If feeding at the breast, wash hands before touching the infant and wear a face mask.  
If expressing breast milk with a pump, wash hands before touching any part of the pump or milk collection bottles, and follow recommendations for proper cleaning after each use.  
If possible, consider having someone else who is healthy feed expressed breast milk to the infant.  

The decision to start or continue breastfeeding is personal for any parent, and should be made in coordination with a health care provider. There are numerous online resources that may also be helpful, such as breastfeeding education, support groups and virtual lactation consultations. 
To concerned parents, Reyes has these words of encouragement: “You are doing everything right! Turn to professional health care organizations to research your questions. Surround yourself with a community—practicing safe social distancing—of individuals who will support you emotionally, physically and mentally. In your child’s eyes, you are perfect.” <SEP> Below are some guidelines for breastfeeding during the COVID-19 outbreak. <EOS>
Where the enforcing authority, such as the Health and Safety Executive or your local authority, identifies employers who are not taking action to comply with the relevant public health legislation and guidance to control public health risks (for example, not completing a new risk assessment taking account the risk of COVID-19, or taking insufficient measures in response), they will consider a range of actions to improve control of workplace risks. This includes giving specific advice to a business, or issuing an improvement notice, which a business must respond to in a fixed time, or a prohibition notice. Failure to comply is a criminal offence, which can lead to fines or imprisonment for up to two years, giving the COVID-19 Secure guidelines indirect legal enforceability.

Other coronaviruses have been found in North American bats in the past, but there is currently no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 is present in any free-living wildlife in the United States, including bats. In general, coronaviruses do not cause illness or death in bats, but we don’t yet know if this new coronavirus would make North American species of bats sick. Bats are an important part of natural ecosystems, and their populations are already declining in the United States. Bat populations could be further threatened by the disease itself or by harm inflicted on bats resulting from a misconception that bats are spreading COVID-19. However, there is no evidence that bats in the United States are a source of the virus that causes COVID-19 for people. Further studies are needed to understand if and how bats could be affected by the virus that causes COVID-19. <SEP> Can bats in the United States get the virus that causes COVID-19 and can they spread it back to people? <EOS>
During viral infection, the rule of thumb is that infection will lead to the development of a memory antibody response that is protective against future infection.
However, for some viruses, like dengue virus, the phenomenon of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection has been described, where antibodies from the first infection help worsen infection with a different dengue strain during the second infection. There is evidence that this may occur during coronavirus infection and has been studied in regard to the SARS virus. However, it remains unclear if ADE is also playing a role in the current novel coronavirus outbreak. More studies are needed to determine if this is happening with SARS-CoV-2, the COVID-19 virus.

New Jersey welcomes travel to and from our state.
However, to save lives and prevent the spread of COVID-19, the State has issued an incoming travel advisory that all individuals entering New Jersey from states with a significant spread of COVID-19 should quarantine for 14-days after leaving that state.
Under the 14-day quarantine travel advisory announced by the Governors of New Jersey, New York and Connecticut, individuals traveling to or returning to New Jersey from states with increasing rates of COVID-19 are advised to self-quarantine for 14 days. This includes travel by train, bus, car, plane and any other method of transportation.
The 14-day quarantine travel advisory applies to travel from certain states identified as those that have a positive COVID-19 test rate higher than 10 per 100,000 residents or have a 10% or higher positivity rate over a seven-day rolling average ("impacted states.")

This list will be updated regularly.
The self-quarantine is voluntary, but compliance is expected.
We ask that you complete a voluntary online survey to provide information about where you are traveling from and your destination if you have traveled to, or are returning from, one of the states that has been designated above.
If you choose to provide this information, it will be shared with local New Jersey Public Health authorities and other third parties when required by law. Local health departments will contact you to remind you to self-quarantine and offer assistance including information about testing locations.
Access the survey by visiting covid19.nj.gov/njtravel or texting "NJTRAVEL" to 898211.
Please note that this advisory does not apply to individuals:

Who passed through a designated state for a period of limited duration (i.e. less than 24 hours) through the course of travel.
Who are passing through New Jersey on a layover for a period of limited duration (i.e. less than 24 hours) through the course of travel.
Who are traveling to New Jersey for business matters that are exempted from the application of the travel advisory.
Who are traveling to New Jersey and work in critical infrastructure fields, such as health care and federal, state and local law enforcement. Consult with your employer regarding whether there is industry-specific guidance that may apply to you.

Travelers and residents returning from impacted states should self-quarantine at their home, a hotel, or other temporary lodging. Individuals should only leave the place of self-quarantine to seek medical care/treatment or to obtain food and other essential items. As one example, no one who has traveled to or from a state on the COVID-19 hotspot list should be participating in or attending an in-person graduation ceremony.
For answers to commonly asked questions, refer to the Department of Health's Frequently Asked Questions about the self-quarantine for travelers.
Exemptions
Business Travel
Individuals who are traveling to New Jersey from impacted states for business are exempted from the application of the travel advisory. This, for example, would include truckers driving from an impacted state to New Jersey, and any state, local and federal officials and employees traveling in their official capacities on government business.
Individuals traveling for business should still consider postponing travel to the extent possible. Individuals are encouraged to self-monitor for symptoms upon return from any travel to an impacted state, and employers should consider screening employees for symptoms before permitting them to return to work. Employees and employers should follow current CDC guidance regarding travel, available here: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-in-the-us.html
Critical Infrastructure Workers
Exceptions to the travel advisory are also permitted for individuals traveling to New Jersey from designated states who work in critical infrastructure, as defined by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. This would include, for example, health care workers and state and local law enforcement. The comprehensive list of critical infrastructure industries is available here: https://www.cisa.gov/identifying-critical-infrastructure-during-covid-19.
Critical Infrastructure workers who have had an exposure but remain asymptomatic should adhere to the screening, social distancing, and mitigation practices prior to and during their work shift, as outlined by the CDC.
Consult with your employer regarding whether there is industry-specific guidance that may apply to you (e.g. guidance for health care professionals: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance-risk-assesment-hcp.html ). Please consult the DOH website and resources for additional details and information regarding isolation procedures for when a person under quarantine is diagnosed with COVID-19 or develops symptoms.
Seasonal Migrant Farm Workers
Migrant workers can continue to work with precautions. Critical infrastructure workers and employers should follow guidance from CDC, as well as NJ Department of Health, regarding strategies to limit disease spread.
Testing
Testing is available to everyone in New Jersey and is strongly encouraged for those who travelled to areas heavily impacted by COVID-19. To find a testing site near you, visit covid19.nj.gov/testing
If you are from an impacted state and get a diagnostic/virus test, you should still self-quarantine for 14 days. If you test negative, you are still advised to self-quarantine for 14 days because you remain in the incubation period. A diagnostic test is a point-in-time indicator from the date of when you were last exposed - in this case, being in a state with significant community spread of COVID-19.
If you are positive, you should self-isolate for 10 days and at least three days (or 72 hours) after any fever is resolved and any other symptoms are significantly improved. You should only leave self-isolation to receive medical care and to obtain food or other essential items.
Additional Travel Guidance
Travel increases your chance of getting and spreading COVID-19. You can get COVID-19 during your travels. You may feel well and not have any symptoms, but you can still spread COVID-19 to others. You and your travel companions may spread COVID-19 to other people including your family, friends, and community for 14 days after you were exposed to the virus.
Destinations may have travel restrictions or requirements, such as mandated quarantines upon arrival.
Check state, territorial, tribal and local public health websites for information before you travel.
If you are traveling internationally, check the CDC's COVID-19 travel recommendations by destination. Many countries are still categorized as a Level-3 high COVID-19 risk, and the CDC recommends avoiding all nonessential travel to these countries.
If you must travel to these countries, you may have be exposed to COVID-19 and the CDC recommends taking the following steps after travel to avoid spreading the virus to others:

Stay home as much as possible
Avoid being around people at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19
Consider getting tested for COVID-19

Consult the CDC's guide for additional advice.

We are still learning about transmission of the new coronavirus. It's not clear if it can be spread by an infected person through food they have handled or prepared, but if so it would more likely be the exception than the rule.That said, the new coronavirus is a respiratory virus known to spread by upper respiratory secretions, including airborne droplets after coughing or sneezing. The virus that causes COVID-19 has also been detected in the stool of certain people. So we currently cannot rule out the possibility of the infection being transmitted through food by an infected person who has not thoroughly washed their hands. In the case of hot food, the virus would likely be killed by cooking. This may not be the case with uncooked foods like salads or sandwiches. <SEP> Can I catch the coronavirus by eating food handled or prepared by others? <EOS>

Yes.  The National Institutes of Health has published COVID-19 treatment guidelines which are located here.  Please read the full report for all details. The initial Summary Recommendations from April 21, 2020 are noted below, followed by updated recommendations from May 12, 2020, June 11, 2020, June 16, 2020, June 25, 2020,  July 17, 2020, July 24, 2020 and July 30, 2020.  These recommendations may change, so visit the NIH webpage to make sure you have current information.
Pre-exposure and Post-exposure Prophylaxis (April 21, 2020):

The COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel (the Panel) does not recommend the use of any agents for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outside of the setting of a clinical trial.
The Panel does not recommend the use of any agents for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) against SARS-CoV-2 infection outside of the setting of a clinical trial.

Antithrombotic Therapy and IVIG (May 12, 2020):

The COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel provides recommendations on the use of antithrombotic agents for the prevention of venous thromboembolic events in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. In addition, the Panel recommends carefully monitoring, evaluating, and treating hospitalized patients with COVID-19 for incident thrombotic events when indicated.
The Panel recommends against the use of non-SARS-CoV-2-specific IVIG for the treatment of COVID-19, except in the context of a clinical trial. This should not preclude the use of IVIG when it is otherwise indicated for the treatment of complications that arise during the course of COVID-19.

Remdesivir (June 11, 2020, July 17, 2020, July 24, 2020):

Recommendation for Prioritizing Limited Supplies of Remdesivir

Because remdesivir supplies are limited, the Panel recommends that remdesivir be prioritized for use in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who require supplemental oxygen but who are not on high-flow oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, mechanical ventilation, or ECMO.  Please visit the NIH website for the full details regarding this recommendation.


Recommendation for Patients with Mild or Moderate COVID-19:

There are insufficient data for the Panel to recommend for or against remdesivir for the treatment of patients with mild or moderate COVID-19.



Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine (June 16, 2020):

The Panel recommends against the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19, except in a clinical trial.
The Food and Drug Administration revoked the emergency use authorization (EUA) that permitted the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine donated to the Strategic National Stockpile to treat certain patients with COVID-19.

Dexamethasone (June 25, 2020):

The COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel (the Panel) recommends using dexamethasone (at a dose of 6 mg per day for up to 10 days) in patients with COVID-19 who are mechanically ventilated and in patients with COVID-19 who require supplemental oxygen but who are not mechanically ventilated.
The Panel recommends against using dexamethasone in patients with COVID-19 who do not require supplemental oxygen.

Other Corticosteroids (July 30, 2020):

The recommendations in this section have been updated to allow the use of alternative corticosteroids (i.e., hydrocortisone, methylprednisolone, prednisone) in situations where dexamethasone may not be available.

Advanced Planning and Surrogate Decision Makers (July 30, 2020):

The Goals of Care subsection has been expanded to include information on advance care planning, with emphasis on the importance of identifying surrogate decision makers for critically ill patients with COVID-19.

Yale School of Medicine (YSM) published a COVID-19 treatment algorithm for hospitalized patients which can be found here.  The most recent version of this document is May 18, 2020.  Please check the website to make sure you are using the most current version of the algorithm. <SEP> Are COVID-19 treatment guidelines available? <EOS>

 Yes, effective March 18, 2020 until the end of the COVID-19 emergency declaration, AHCCCS health plans shall not discount rates for services provided via telehealth and telephonically as compared to contracted rates for "in-person" services. <SEP>  Are AHCCCS health plans required to reimburse at the same rate for services provided “in-person” and  services provided via telehealth and/or telephonically? <EOS>
A negative test result for this test means that SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not present in the specimen above the limit of detection, at the date/time the specimen was obtained. However, a negative result does not rule out the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or patient management decisions.
When diagnostic testing is negative, the possibility of a false negative result should be considered, especially if the patient’s recent exposures or clinical presentation indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infection is likely, and diagnostic tests for other causes of illness (e.g., other respiratory illness) are negative. If COVID-19 is still suspected based on exposure history and clinical findings, re-testing should be considered in consultation with public health authorities.
Risks to a patient of a false negative include: delayed or lack of supportive treatment, lack of monitoring of infected individuals and their household or other close contacts for symptoms resulting in increased risk of spread of COVID-19 within the community, or other unintended adverse events.

Anyone who has had close contact with a person with COVID-19 will need to be put into quarantine for 14 days. This means that they will be placed in a room separate from others, until staff are sure that they don’t have symptoms. If symptoms develop during the 14-day period, and/or the person in quarantine tests positive for COVID-19, they should be placed under medical isolation and evaluated. If symptoms do not develop and they do not test positive for COVID-19, quarantine restrictions can be lifted, or removed, after the 14-day period ends. Quarantine procedures may differ by facility. <SEP> What does it mean if someone I know is in quarantine? <EOS>
The COVID-19 crisis has left people of all ages feeling irritable and fatigued. Some teens might respond to those feelings by sleeping most of the day. Don’t let them. 
“Excessive sleeping is not good for mental health, and it can be a sign of depression,” Dr. Conn explains. “And if your teen is sleeping all day and staying up all night, it will be more difficult for them to adjust when life goes back to a regular routine.” 
Certainly, teens don’t have to wake at 6 a.m., she adds. But be sure they are getting up during the morning hours. 
Keep a routine 
Encourage teens to stick to a daily routine. That means eating on schedule, completing schoolwork, helping around the house, connecting with friends virtually, and limiting naps and screen time. 
One idea is to create a visual schedule—writing down tasks to do that day and posting it somewhere. Be sure to enlist your teen’s input on this list and allow downtime and fun time. “Keep the list very doable,” she stresses. “You don’t want to overwhelm your teen; you just want to create some structure for the day.” 
Let teens decide on virtual celebrations 
“Adolescence is a time when we want more independence, more choice,” Dr. Conn notes. “Being told ‘No, you can’t do any of the things you were doing before’ is particularly difficult for them. They feel like they don’t have control over their lives.” 
That’s why it’s important for parents to let teens choose how to mark those milestones they’re missing. “Some teens may be excited about a virtual prom, but others might say, ‘I feel weird getting all dressed up to sit in front of my computer,’” she says. “Don’t push it. Leave it up to them.” 
And if your teen wants to have a birthday or graduation party after the crisis, make sure that celebration happens. Don’t let it fall by the wayside after life gets busy again. 
Get moving 
A lack of physical activity can lead to depression—or make existing depression worse. “Teens need to get some exercise in, while still observing masking and physical distancing guidelines,” Dr. Conn says. “Even a walk around the block can be helpful.” 
Other options include online dance classes and workout videos. Gentle yoga and stretching via videos or mobile apps can also break up the day and boost their mood. 
Encourage teens to give back 
Lending a hand to others in need can empower adolescents and counter feelings of helplessness. Activities can be as simple as delivering groceries to a grandparent, sewing face masks for neighbors or calling a friend who’s had a tough week. 
“This is a good opportunity for teens to see themselves as leaders and find ways to support each other and their community,” she says.  
Ask for help 
If your teen is suffering from depression or anxiety or is withdrawing from friends, family and school, seek help. In addition to calling your teen’s primary care doctor, here are some resources for teens in crisis: 


National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 1-800-273-8255 




The Trevor Project (for LGBTQ youth): 1-866-488-7386 


California Youth Crisis Line: 1-800-843-5200 


Be kind to your teen—and yourself 
“It’s important for parents and caregivers to take care of their own mental health,” Dr. Conn says. “There are so many big, looming unknowns right now. We all need to hold ourselves with a lot of kindness! We need to have empathy and compassion not just for our youth, but for ourselves.” <SEP> Watch for too much sleeping <EOS>
No, WHO does not recommend the use of gloves by people in the community. The wearing of gloves may increase risk of infection, since it can lead to self-contamination or transmission to others when touching contaminated surfaces and then the face.Therefore, in public places such as supermarkets, in addition to physical distancing, WHO recommends the installation of public hand hygiene stations at the entrance and exit.By widely improving hand hygiene practices, countries can help prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus.WHO recommends that people always consult local authorities on recommended practices in their area. <SEP> Does WHO recommend the use of gloves in the community to prevent transmission of COVID-19? <EOS>
Yes. And please do so, doctors say.
This year, it’s “more important than ever to get a flu shot because we will almost certainly face the double whammy of flu season coinciding the same time as surging cases of COVID-19,” emergency room physician Dr. Leana Wen said. 
And a flu/coronavirus double whammy could be disastrous if it overwhelms the healthcare system. An estimated 410,000 to 740,000 Americans were hospitalized with the flu this past flu season, from October to April, according to the CDC.
Wen said the flu shot is about 40% to 60% effective. But even if you do get the flu after having been vaccinated, the flu shot “still reduces your chance of having severe effects from the flu.”
You also want to avoid having a personal double whammy of getting both the flu and Covid-19. And yes, it is possible to have both at the same time. <SEP> Is it safe to get a flu shot in the fall? <EOS>

Yes. Hospitals and birth centers are taking every precaution to make sure moms
               and babies are safe from germs. Most health care
               facilities keep patients with COVID-19 or symptoms of the virus away from others and
               in isolation wards.
Some hospitals are limiting the number of people allowed in the delivery room.
               When your baby is born, visitors may not be allowed in the hospital. If they are,

People should either stay 2 metres apart or ‘1 metre plus’ – which is one metre plus mitigations that will help to prevent transmission. These mitigations will depend on the workplace or setting. For example, on public transport (and from July 24, in shops and supermarkets), people must wear a face covering, as it is not always possible to stay 2m apart. People should also wash or sanitise their hands regularly and avoid the busiest routes and times (like the rush hour).
In other spaces, mitigations could include installing screens, making sure people face away from each other, putting up hand washing facilities, minimising the amount of time you spend with people outside your household or bubble, and being outdoors.
We have set out COVID-19 Secure guidance to help businesses take the measures that are right for them. <SEP> 5.3 Do I need to stay 2 metres apart – or 1 metre? <EOS>
Yes you can, said Dr. Joseph Vinetz, an infectious diseases professor at Yale School of Medicine. 
To disinfect masks that you can’t wash, Vinetz recommends leaving them in a clean, safe place in your home for a few days. After that, it should no longer be infectious, as this coronavirus is known to survive on hard surfaces for only up to three days. 
You can reuse cloth masks, too. Just launder them between each use on a high-heat setting.

On Dec. 31, 2019, Chinese health officials alerted the World Health Organization of several cases of pneumonia in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China. The pneumonia was caused by a virus that did not match any other known virus. <SEP> How did this outbreak begin? <EOS>
This is decided on a case-by-case basis. Those with mild illness can be sent home, providing the home environment is conducive to home isolation recommendations.
A healthcare professional should assess whether the residential setting is appropriate for home care. Considerations for care at home include whether:

The patient is stable enough to receive care at home.
Appropriate caregivers are available at home.
There is a separate bedroom where the patient can recover without sharing immediate space with others.
Resources for access to food and other necessities are available.
The patient and other household members have access to appropriate, recommended personal protective equipment (at a minimum, gloves and facemask) and are capable of adhering to precautions recommended as part of home care or isolation (e.g., respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette, hand hygiene);
There are household members who may be at increased risk of complications from COVID-19 infection (.e.g., older adults, young children, pregnant women, people who are immunocompromised or who have chronic heart, lung, or kidney conditions).

It is very important that people with even mild signs of illness (fever, cough, chills, shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat) stay home to prevent spreading illness to others! 
All patients, even those with mild illness, should be provided with correct self-isolation guidance. See:

Most newborns who have tested positive for COVID-19 had mild or no symptoms and have recovered fully. However, there are a few reports of newborns with severe illness.
Based on limited reports, adverse infant outcomes (e.g., preterm birth) have been reported among infants born to mothers positive for COVID-19 during pregnancy. However, it is not clear that these outcomes were related to maternal infection, and at this time the risk of adverse infant outcomes is not known. <SEP> Are infants born to mothers with COVID-19 during pregnancy at increased risk for adverse outcomes? <EOS>

Currently, there is no evidence to suggest the virus that causes COVID-19 is circulating in free-living wildlife in the United States, or that wildlife might be a source of infection for people in the United States. The first case of a wild animal testing positive for the virus in the United States was a tiger with respiratory illness at a zoo in New York City. However, this tiger was in a captive zoo environment, and public health officials believe the tiger became sick after being exposed to a zoo employee who was infected and spreading the virus.
If a wild animal were to become infected with the virus, we don’t know whether the infection could then spread among wildlife or if it could spread to other animals, including pets. Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals, including wildlife, could be affected by COVID-19. Because wildlife can carry other diseases, even without looking sick, it is always important to enjoy wildlife from a distance.
Take steps to prevent getting sick from wildlife in the United States:

Keep your family, including pets, a safe distance away from wildlife.
Do not feed wildlife or touch wildlife droppings.
Always wash your hands and supervise children washing their hands after working or playing outside.
Leave orphaned animals alone. Often, the parents are close by and will return for their young.
Consult your state wildlife agency’s guidance if you are preparing or consuming legally harvested game meat.
Do not approach or touch a sick or dead animal – contact your state wildlife agency instead. <SEP> Can wild animals spread the virus that causes COVID-19 to people or pets? <EOS>

Non-resident COVID-19 cases have been a common occurrence in the State of Florida, where a substantial number of residents from the New York metro area have relocated. In reporting COVID-19 statistics, the Florida Department of Health tracks positive cases separately for residents and non-residents. (NOTE: in recent weeks, Florida’s and other states’ data reporting practices have come under scrutiny.)
Nonetheless, when determining whether and how to reopen your city’s economy, a best practice would be to include these positive cases when tracking your progress against the federally-recommended gating criteria – particularly since it is difficult to track the extent of whether and for how long these non-resident individuals remain in the local community, with the potential to infect permanent/longer-term residents.

It’s a challenging regulatory landscape, and accountability is important, but the goal for mayors should be to engage with these facilities and offer assistance, because these are enormous challenges, and they simply can't do it alone. The solutions to many of their problems are outside their facilities. Creating trusted partnerships and helping to solve problems should encourage transparency and accountability. Most nursing homes want to do right by their patients and just need additional tools to do so.
If we are creating a situation in which we are disincentivizing the reporting of cases by identifying individual facilities publicly, then I'm not sure how that helps us control COVID-19 or any other outbreak. (Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, 4/29/20)
State regulatory authorities are stretched thin in these situations and need help. You can reach out to them with sympathy rather than reproach: “You’ve got your hands full trying to contain COVID-19 in nursing homes. You’ve put out guidance. Let me help make sure people can implement it.” This could get you more information about what's going on, and also make it clear that you're in alignment.

 Yes. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) created a new Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) code for COVID-19 tests administered outside of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) testing laboratories. This code corresponds with a Food and Drug Administration policy that allows certain laboratories to develop their own tests. Providers should use existing HCPCS code U0001 for CDC testing laboratories and the new HCPCS code U0002 for non-CDC lab tests. In addition, the American Medical Association has added a new Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code: 87635 infectious agent detection by nucleic acid (DNA or RNA); severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Coronavirus disease [COVID-19]), amplified probe technique.
			CMS has created additional codes to be used for tests performed with high throughput technologies, in which cases U0003 should be used to identify tests that would otherwise be identified by CPT code 87635, and U0004 should be used to identify tests that would otherwise be identified by U0002. Neither U0003 nor U0004 should be used for tests that detect COVID-19 antibodies. <SEP>  Are there billing codes available for COVID-19 testing outside of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) testing laboratories? <EOS>
Since the virus is transmitted through respiratory droplets, the risk of catching it from somebody who is asymptomatic, even a contact of a confirmed COVID-19 case, is low. However, in light of the pandemic, everyone should maintain social distancing, which means keeping at least 1 meter away from others, avoiding mass gatherings and areas with large numbers of people, and practicing frequent hand washing and hand sanitizing according to the recommendation. <SEP> Can I catch the virus from being in an enclosed space (i.e. bus, subway) in close proximity to someone who doesn’t have respiratory symptoms? <EOS>

Physical distancing means staying at least 6 feet (about 2 arms' lengths) away from other people when outside of your home, and avoiding large crowds. It's one of the best ways we can prevent the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19.
This is because the virus spreads from person to person through the air. When an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks, droplets from their mouth or nose can travel through the air and into the mouths, noses, or lungs of people nearby. The farther apart you are from someone who's infected, the less likely you are to have contact with these droplets.
We're following VHA and CDC guidelines to ensure physical distancing in our facilities by:
Using remote check-in options by text or phone when possible
Keeping a physical separation between Veterans and staff with the use of desks, tables, Plexiglas, or other partitions
Providing more space in waiting rooms and other areas
Adding signs and floor markings to remind patients and staff about how to create safe physical distance
Changing processes for waiting for prescription, lab, and imaging services
We encourage you to also practice physical distancing while in any public location. Even people who show no symptoms of COVID-19 can likely still spread the virus. To learn more about how to protect yourself and others, go to the CDC website. <SEP> What is physical distancing, and how will VA use it to protect me? <EOS>
Symptom severity can be influenced by many different factors. For other viruses, oftentimes more exposure leads to more rapid disease and a higher likelihood of severe symptoms. Also, people who are older, have a worse health status (e.g. cancer patients, people taking immunosuppressive drugs, people with chronic health problems, or are otherwise immune compromised) are usually more likely to get sicker.
In the case of COVID-19 specifically, it is hard to know who has had more virus from any single interaction. However, we have seen that healthcare workers who are frequently taking care of sick patients are at higher risk of catching it themselves. It is recommended to stay at least 6 feet away from everyone and also reduce the time you are exposed to everyone as much as possible, since even people who do not exhibit COVID-19 symptoms when infected can spread the virus.
Drafted 3 April 2020 <SEP> Am I likely to get sicker if I'm exposed to multiple infected people, similar to medical professionals being exposed to multiple infected individuals? <EOS>
The best way to prevent illness is to take steps to avoid being exposed to this virus. Start by ensuring you and others around you use everyday preventive actions (such as washing hands often, avoiding touching your eyes, nose, and mouth, and covering your cough). Read How to Protect Yourself to learn more. <SEP> How can I lower the chance that I will get COVID-19? <EOS>

Isolation is what you do if you have COVID-19 symptoms, or test positive. Isolation means you stay home and away from others (including household members) for the recommended period of time to avoid spreading illness.
Quarantine is what you do if you were exposed to COVID-19.  Quarantine means you stay home and away from others for the recommended period of time in case you are infected and are contagious. Quarantine becomes isolation if you later test positive for COVID-19 or develop symptoms. <SEP> What’s the difference between isolation and quarantine? <EOS>
Practicing hand and respiratory hygiene is important at ALL times and is the best way to protect others and yourself.When possible maintain at least a 1 meter distance between yourself and others. This is especially important if you are standing by someone who is coughing or sneezing.  Since some infected persons may not yet be exhibiting symptoms or their symptoms may be mild, maintaining a physical distance with everyone is a good idea if you are in an area where COVID-19 is circulating. <SEP> How can we protect others and ourselves if we don't know who is infected? <EOS>
Yes.  However, when outside your residence you must always and as reasonably possible maintain social distancing of at least 6 feet (about 2 arms’ length) from other people who do not live with you.  Keeping space between you and others is one of the best tools to avoiding being exposed to the virus.  For more information about Gov.

Even if you have clean hands, it's still best not to touch your face so that you get into the habit of not doing so unconsciously when out and about. At home, it would be okay to touch your face but again, trying not to will decrease the chances of you unwittingly doing so when out in public. Keep all light switches, doorknobs, handles on appliances, etc. clean at home and office, to reduce the chances of the virus remaining on surfaces. <SEP> Even if you have clean hands, can you still not touch your face? <EOS>
Do not exercise if you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing. Stay home and rest, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.If you are able to go for a walk or bicycle ride always practice physical distancing and wash your hands with water and soap before you leave, when you get to where you are going, and as soon as you get home.  If water and soap are not immediately available, use alcohol-based hand rub. If you go to a park or public open space to walk, run or exercise always practice physical distancing and wash your hands with water and soap, before you leave, when you get to where you are going, and as soon as you get home.  If water and soap are not immediately available, use alcohol-based hand rub. Follow the directions of your local health authority in regards to any restrictions on the number of people with you and/or restrictions on the use of public outdoor play or exercise equipment. If you are not regularly active start slowly and with low intensity activities, like walking and low impact exercises. Start with shorter amounts, like 5-10 minutes, and gradually build up to 30 minutes or more continuously over a few weeks. It is better and safer to be active for short periods more frequently than to try and be active for long periods when you are not used to it. Choose the right activity so that you reduce the risk of injury and that you enjoy the activity. Choose the right intensity according to your health status and fitness level. You should be able to breath comfortably and hold a conversation while you do light- and moderate-intensity physical activity. <SEP> So how do I stay safe while exercising in COVID-19? <EOS>

NOTE: Testing is now available to everyone in New Jersey. Get tested for COVID-19 after participating in large gatherings where social distancing is hard to maintain. To learn more about where and how to get tested, visit New Jersey's COVID-19 testing resource page.
The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet) and through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Some recent studies have suggested that COVID-19 may be spread by people who are not showing symptoms.
To protect yourself and others from COVID-19:

Keep six feet between yourself and others whenever possible.
Wear a cloth face covering to prevent spreading respiratory droplets. Face coverings are required in indoor public spaces and in outdoor public spaces when social distancing is difficult to maintain.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouthwith unwashed hands.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place.
If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.
If you are sick with COVID-19 or think you might have it, the CDC recommends staying home except to get medical care.

Visit the CDC site to learn more about how to protect yourself.
Note: First Amendment-protected outdoor activities, such as political protests of any persuasion or outdoor religious services, are not a violation of New Jersey's limits on outdoor gatherings. For more information, refer to Executive Order No. 152.

CDC has released information about strategies to optimize the supply of isolation gowns. Healthcare facilities should refer to that guidance and implement the recommended strategies to optimize their current supply of gowns. This includes shifting toward the use of washable cloth gowns, if feasible.
The use of gowns as part of Contact Precautions in the context of MDROs has been implemented primarily to reduce the risk of transmission to other patients rather than to protect healthcare personnel (HCP). Facilities with shortages could consider suspending the use of gowns for the care of patients with endemic MDROs, such as MRSA, VRE, and ESBL-producing Gram-negative bacilli except as required for Standard Precautions. Facilities should assess their local epidemiology to determine which MDROs are considered endemic. Regardless of the use of gowns, HCP at facilities should continue to wear gloves for contact with these patients and their environment. Hand hygiene should continue to be emphasized. Facilities should also attempt to place patients colonized or infected with an MDRO in a private room, if available.

Caring for patients who have highly resistant Gram-negative organisms (e.g., carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriacae) and other MDROs (e.g., Candida auris) that are not considered endemic:  Rather than gowns being donned for every room entry, they should be reserved for use as part of Standard Precautions and also prioritized for high-contact patient care activities that pose highest risk for transfer of pathogens from the patient to HCP. Examples of such high-contact care activities include dressing, bathing/showering, transferring, providing hygiene, changing linens, changing briefs or assisting with toileting, device care or use (central line, urinary catheter, feeding tube, tracheostomy/ventilator), and wound care. To further preserve gowns, HCP are recommended to bundle high-contact care activities as part of individual care encounters.  Regardless of the use of gowns, HCP at facilities should continue to wear gloves for contact with these patients and their environment. Hand hygiene should continue to be emphasized. Facilities should also attempt to place patients colonized or infected with an MDRO in a private room, if available.
Caring for patients with Clostridioides difficile infections (CDI):  Facilities should continue using Contact Precautions (putting on a gown and gloves upon entry into the patient’s room and placing the patient in a private room) for the care of symptomatic patients with CDI.  As part of a supplemental strategy to prevent transmission of CDI, some facilities have implemented Contact Precautions for the care of patients at high risk for CDI who have asymptomatic carriage of Clostridioides difficile. There are limited data about the role of asymptomatic carriage in transmission of CDI. In this setting of a critical national shortage of gowns, facilities should consider suspending this approach until the shortage is addressed. Gowns should still be used as part of Standard Precautions. <SEP> My hospital is experiencing a shortage of isolation gowns. To preserve our supply, can we stop using gowns for the care of patients with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and other endemic multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs), and Clostridioides difficile? <EOS>
An event or gathering is a temporary grouping of individuals for defined purposes, that takes place over a limited timeframe, such as hours or days.

While most COVID-19 infections have been diagnosed in adults, kids can get infected.
               In children, the virus sometimes causes a mild illness, and often causes no symptoms

According to the CDC, the test may not find antibodies in someone with a current COVID-19 infection. It depends on when someone was infected and the timing of the test.
Antibody tests cannot be used as the only way to diagnose someone as currently being sick with COVID-19.
We don’t yet know if a positive antibody test means you are immune to COVID-19.
Antibody tests may react with other seasonal viruses and result in false positive results. <SEP> Do you recommend antibody testing? Why not? <EOS>

It’s possible, but this isn’t the main way the virus spreads. Experts believe COVID-19 spreads through droplets from infected people. If these droplets settle on a surface, you touch them, and then you touch your eyes, nose, or mouth, it’s possible you will get sick. However, it’s not clear how long the germs remain on surfaces, and it’s unlikely the virus survives for long. 

Clean and sanitize items around your house that are frequently touched by people, such as television remotes, phones, and doorknobs, at least once a day.
If someone in your household is sick, isolate them and don't share household items with them. Clean their items separately from everyone else's. <SEP> Can I get COVID-19 from touching a contaminated surface? <EOS>

 Effective May 11, 2020, and unless otherwise permitted or required by this order, all employers shall take reasonable steps, where practicable as work duties permit, to protect their employees by: 
maintaining six feet of separation between employees;
regularly disinfecting frequently used items and surfaces;
encouraging handwashing;
preventing employees who are sick from coming into contact with other persons;
facilitating remote working arrangements; and
minimizing employee travel.
 In addition to complying with the requirements of the current Safer at Home health order, employers are strongly encouraged to read and implement the Alabama Department of Public Health's Guidelines for Safeguarding All Businesses. <SEP>  What steps can employers who are reopening take to protect their employees? <EOS>
VDH and the Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) have worked together to provide guidance for homeless shelters, which can be found here.
Some of these recommendations include:

Increasing distance or implementing a barrier between staff and guests for registration and entry
Implementing shifts for meals or otherwise staggering access to services
Increased distance or physical barriers between beds, arranging beds head-to-toe

VDH encourages shelter staff to screen people for symptoms consistent with COVID-19 infection. Guests who have tested positive or have symptoms should have a separate space from all other guests.  Those who are at risk for severe complications if infected with COVID-19 should also have a separate area if possible. <SEP> What are homeless shelters doing to protect people from getting COVID-19? <EOS>
NOTICE TO TRAVELERS:
The State of New Jersey has issued an incoming travel advisory that all individuals traveling to or returning to New Jersey from states with a significant spread of COVID-19 are advised to self-quarantine for 14 days. For more information about the travel advisory and which states currently meet the advisory's criteria, visit covid19.nj.gov/travel.
The CDC recommends avoiding all non-essential international travel due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. If you travel internationally, the CDC recommends you stay home, monitor your health, and practice social distancing for 14 days after you return from travel. Learn more about what to do if you are sick after travel.
Airports
Airports remain open and air travel continues. Travellers must wear face coverings at airport terminals and on public transportation.
For flights, cancellations, or rerouting, please contact your airline directly for the latest information.
For additional domestic travel information, please visit the CDC, and for additional international travel information, please visit travel.state.gov
The situation is changing frequently, so please check the above resources for the most up-to-date information.
All decisions regarding the screening of international passengers arriving at all airports in the United States are made by federal agencies including the CDC and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). As it has since January, the Port Authority is providing all necessary support for the screening currently being carried out by the CDC and CBP of passengers at its airports and any ensuing referrals for quarantine are in cooperation with state and city health authorities.
Bridges and Tunnels
Bridges and tunnels remain open.
As of Sunday, March 22, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey will only collect tolls by electronic means and temporarily suspend cash toll collection at the George Washington Bridge, Lincoln Tunnel, and Holland Tunnel.
Motorists with E-ZPass will experience no change, using any open toll lane to have the toll debited from their prepaid E-ZPass account. For motorists without E-ZPass, an image of the vehicle's license plate will be captured and a notice seeking payment of the toll will be mailed to the registered owner of the vehicle. Motorists billed by mail will pay the amount of the standard cash toll; no additional fees will be charged.

In settings where facemasks are not available, HCPs might use homemade masks (e.g., bandana, scarf) for care of patients with COVID-19 as a last resort. However, homemade masks are not considered PPE, since their capability to protect HCP is unknown. Caution should be exercised when considering this option. Homemade masks should ideally be used in combination with a face shield that covers the entire front (that extends to the chin or below) and sides of the face.
Continued community transmission has increased the number of individuals potentially exposed to and infectious with SARS-CoV-2. Fever and symptom screening will not identify individuals who are infected but otherwise asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic; additional interventions are needed to limit the unrecognized introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into healthcare settings by these individuals.
As part of aggressive source control measures, healthcare facilities should  implement policies requiring everyone entering the facility to wear a cloth face covering (if tolerated) while in the building, regardless of symptoms. This approach is consistent with a recommendation to the general public advising them to wear a cloth face covering whenever they must leave their home. <SEP> Is it safe to use hand-sewn or homemade facemasks in the event that no facemasks are available? <EOS>
No. Multi-pathogen molecular assays, such as those manufactured by Biofire or Genmark, can detect a number of human respiratory viruses, including other coronaviruses that can cause acute respiratory illness, but they do not detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19.
However, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the CDC Influenza SARS-CoV-2 (Flu SC2) Multiplex Assay on July 2, 2020. Test kits are in production and will be shipped to public health laboratories once production, including quality control and assembly, has been completed. The CDC Influenza SARS-CoV-2 (Flu SC2) Multiplex Assay is a real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test that detects and differentiates RNA from SARS-CoV-2, influenza A virus, and influenza B virus in upper or lower respiratory specimens. The assay provides a sensitive, nucleic-acid-based diagnostic tool for evaluation of specimens from patients in the acute phase of infection. <SEP> Do current diagnostic assays for routine human coronaviruses cross-react with SARS-CoV-2? <EOS>
Mayors can talk to hospitals, labs, or health departments about setting aside testing for nursing homes, and then work to establish a team to go out and perform tests for patients and staff.
In Maryland, for example, there is a process where the health department identifies a nursing home outbreak, and then Johns Hopkins or another entity sends a team, with protective equipment, to test everyone and give advice on infection control. Mayors can play an important role in connecting parties to get the tests where they need to be. (Dr. Josh Sharfstein, 4/29/20)
You can use your position as mayor to advocate for the facilities in your community—especially as additional resources may be coming into the state, and nursing homes may experience challenges accessing them.

You do not need to wear a cloth face covering when you are in your own home or in your car, if you are only with people in your own household. You also do not need to wear a cloth face covering when you are exercising outdoors and you have plenty of space.

And some people may have health conditions or circumstances that make wearing a cloth face covering difficult or dangerous. <SEP> When do I not have to wear a face covering? <EOS>
If the patient cannot be evaluated using CDC’s recommended infection prevention and control precautions, the outpatient practice will need to arrange referral and transport of the masked patient to a setting where this can be done.

Although we don't know exactly how much masks and physical distancing help, we do know that these measures are needed to open the economy in the safest way possible and are our best chance of keeping it open. But in order to work, everyone must comply.Coronavirus spreads when someone breathes in virus that an infected person emits through coughs or sneezes, or when they talk or breathe, or when a person touches a contaminated surface and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth. Physical distancing of at least six feet and wearing a tight-fitting cloth mask that covers your nose and mouth can help prevent spread. (Medical-grade N95 masks are more effective than cloth masks, but are in short supply and should be reserved for healthcare workers.) Continue to wash your hands frequently as well.Researchers at Columbia University recently affirmed the importance of these health-promoting behaviors. They reported that 36,000 fewer people would have died in the coronavirus outbreak if physical distancing measures has started one week earlier; if physical distancing had begun two weeks earlier, 54,000 fewer people may have died. <SEP> How much difference will masks and physical distancing make as states begin to reopen? <EOS>
COVID-19 is a respiratory illness caused by a new, or “novel” coronavirus that was not identified in humans before December 2019. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that usually cause mild respiratory illnesses such as the common cold. Some coronaviruses have caused more severe illness, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).
Most people will recover on their own, but some people can develop more serious complications, such as pneumonia, and require medical care or hospitalization. Older people and people with chronic illnesses are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19.
The novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person to person and the number of cases detected in Washington, nationally, and in other countries is growing.
The risk of COVID-19 is not connected to race, ethnicity or nationality.  Share accurate information with others to keep rumors and misinformation from spreading. <SEP> What is COVID-19? <EOS>

Does it have at least two layers? Good. 
If you hold it up to the light, can you see through it? Bad. 
Can you blow a candle out through your mask? Bad.
Do you feel mostly OK wearing it for hours at a time? Good. 
The most important thing, after finding a mask that fits well without gapping, is to find a mask that you will wear.
Every brand in the history of clothing, it seems, has entered the mask market. Spend some time picking out your mask, and find something that works with your personal style.

The coronavirus clings to wetness and enters and exits the body through any wet tissue (your mouth, your eyes, the inside of your nose). That’s why people are wearing masks and eyeshields. They’re like an umbrella for your body; they keep your droplets in and other people’s droplets out. 
But masks only work if you are wearing them properly. The mask should cover your face from the bridge of your nose to under your chin, and should stretch almost to your ears. Be sure there are no gaps — that sort of defeats the purpose, no? <SEP> Why do masks work? <EOS>
If someone tests positive for COVID-19 who has been working at your facility or worksite within 48 hours prior to

Children who are in general good health can wear a non-medical or fabric mask. This provides source control, meaning it keeps the virus from being transmitted to others if they are infected and are not aware that they are infected. The adult who is providing the mask should ensure the fabric mask is the correct size and sufficiently covers the nose, mouth and chin of the child. Children with underlying health conditions such as cystic fibrosis, cancer or immunosuppression, should, in consultation with their medical providers, wear a medical mask. A medical mask controls spreading of the virus and protection to the wearer, and is recommended for anyone who is at higher risk of getting seriously ill from COVID-19. <SEP> What type of mask should children wear? <EOS>

Maybe. 
If your family or friends live nearby, consider linking up quar-pods. If you as parents agree to community norms and guidelines, you can probably let your kids play together as if the world were normal. 
But if you’re unable to do that, or you want to see someone for a play date, know that there are risks. Playgrounds are open in some states, and young children are being asked to stay six feet apart and wear masks, an often unrealistic expectation.
If you’re trying for a play date, good communication with a parent is essential. 
“A start would be, ‘Hi, our kids have been asking about getting together, and as you know, this is a complicated conversation right now,’” said Dr. Dipesh Navsaria, an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health. A parent could continue, “I wanted to start with an open conversation, see where you are, tell you where I am, and see if it’s possible to send a consistent message to our kids.”
Enlist your kids for help, too. If they feel like it’s a project that they’re doing together, they might find some way to enjoy it. You could make spaces — all of the kids get their own blanket — if you’re playing outside. 
But there’s no good answer to this. If you can keep your kids away from other kids, you’re reducing your family’s risk of infection. That might not be possible, but it might also be the only way to do it safely. <SEP> What about socializing with other children? Can we do it safely? <EOS>

To hold your parking space, you must continue to pay for parking. Contract parkers have the right to cancel their contracts to stop fees, but we can’t hold parking spots. If you cancel now and later request parking, you will be placed on a waiting list for your preferred facility.

CDC does not generally issue advisories or restrictions for travel within the United States. However, cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have been reported in many states, and some areas are experiencing community spread of the disease. Crowded travel settings, like airports, may increase chances of getting COVID-19, if there are other travelers with coronavirus infection. There are several things you should consider when deciding whether it is safe for you to travel.
Check the CDC website for more information: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-in-the-us.html. <SEP> Should I travel? <EOS>
By law, doctors and labs must report positive cases of COVID-19 to the local health jurisdiction (county health department, etc.). A trained contact tracer then reaches out to the person who tested positive to start a case investigation. <SEP> How does public health know when a person has COVID-19? <EOS>
Air travel requires spending time in security lines and airport terminals, which can bring you in close contact with other people and frequently touched surfaces. Most viruses and other germs do not spread easily on flights because of how air circulates and is filtered on airplanes. However, social distancing is difficult on crowded flights, and you may have to sit near others (within 6 feet), sometimes for hours. This may increase your risk for exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19.

As of right now, we can't pay you for hours you haven't worked. But we understand the impact this pandemic is having on students. We're working to follow both established and new, temporary guidance specific to COVID-19 to continue benefits for as many students as possible.
For on-the-job training and apprenticeships
If your training facility:
Changes to an online format, you'll continue to receive your regular monthly housing payments.
Remains open, but you stop training due to furlough, illness, or other reasons, you'll continue to receive your payments through the last day of your training.
Temporarily closes, you'll receive your payments through the end of the program or 28 days, whichever is sooner.
For work-study students
If:
We've processed a new contract and you requested advanced payment, we'll still process your advancement as long as we've received your signed agreement.
Your work-study facility temporarily closes, you can switch your contract location as long as the new site supervisor accepts you and we receive a new application for the new site.
Your school can offer you temporary off-campus remote work, we'll continue to pay for submitted hours as long as the work satisfies your work-study requirements.
Your school cancels classes completely and you won't be enrolled at that or any other facility or taking online classes paid for by VA, we'll pay you for the hours you worked until the end of your contract term or until 4 weeks after the date the school closed, whichever comes first.

CDC continues to work with state, local, and territorial health departments to accelerate reporting of national case surveillance data, improve data quality, and gather complete information about all COVID-19 cases.
CDC is working with healthcare providers, electronic health record developers, laboratories, and state and local health departments to modernize disease surveillance by automating the generation and transmission of case reports from the electronic health record to public health agencies for review and action for the COVID-19 response.
For example, expanded use of electronic case reporting, which make the submission of information from healthcare providers to public health departments seamless and automated, will reduce the burden of manually reporting COVID-19 cases, increase timeliness of reporting, and improve data completeness by pulling data directly from the medical record.

Social distancing means keeping enough space between people to avoid the spread
               of germs. Experts say the right amount of space is about 6 feet (2 meters).
We all try not to get too close to people when they (or we) are sick with any contagious
               virus. But social distancing is more
               than staying away from people who are sick or coughing, or who don't feel well. It
               means keeping a safe distance from people who don't live with us, even people who
               look and feel perfectly healthy. Even though we feel perfectly healthy.
Social distancing is a new idea for most of us. But it's not new to scientists
               who study the spread of diseases. They know it's something we all can do to make a
               big difference in the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19). <SEP> What Is Social Distancing? <EOS>
Of course. That is a lot of activities planned. But that"s perfect.

Unlike patient care in the controlled environment of a healthcare facility, care and transport by EMS present unique challenges because of the nature of the setting. Coveralls are an acceptable alternative to gowns when caring for and transporting suspect COVID-19 patients.  While no clinical studies have been done to compare gowns and coveralls, both have been used effectively by healthcare workers in clinical settings during patient care. CDC’s Considerations for Selecting Protective Clothing used in Healthcare for Protection against Microorganisms in Blood and Body Fluids guidance provides a comparison between gowns and coveralls, including test methods and performance requirements. Coveralls typically provide 360-degree protection because they are designed to cover the whole body, including the back and lower legs, and sometimes the head and feet as well.  This added coverage may be necessary for some work tasks involved in medical transport. However, coveralls may lead to increased heat stress compared to gowns due to the total area covered by the fabric. Training on how to properly remove (doff) a coverall is important to prevent self-contamination. Comparatively, gowns are easier to put on and, in particular, to take off. <SEP> Is it acceptable for emergency medical services to wear coveralls as an alternative to gowns when COVID-19 is suspected in a patient needing emergency transport? <EOS>
 AHCCCS, working in conjunction with the Arizona Department of Education and Public Consulting Group (AHCCCS’ third party administrator for the Medicaid School Based Claiming program), have updated their systems to allow LEAs to bill for telehealth services for the Medicaid in Schools program for Dates of Service (DOS) March 30, 2020 and later. <SEP>   Can LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES (LEAs) receive reimbursement for Medicaid-covered medical services provided to eligible students through telehealth and telephonic means during school closures due to COVID-19? <EOS>
We do not have information from published scientific reports about the susceptibility of pregnant women to COVID-19. Pregnant women experience immunologic and physiologic changes, which might make them more susceptible to viral respiratory infections, including COVID-19.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly by close contact with an infected person through respiratory droplets. Whether a pregnant woman with COVID-19 can transmit the virus that causes COVID-19 to her fetus or neonate by other routes of vertical transmission (before, during, or after delivery) is still unknown. <SEP> Are pregnant women more susceptible to the COVID-19 virus and will it harm the fetus? <EOS>
There are currently no antiviral drugs approved by FDA to treat COVID-19. See Interim Clinical Guidance for Management of Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

A large proportion of the population (up to 15-20%) reports seasonal symptoms related to pollen, the most common of which include itchy eyes, nasal congestion, runny nose and sometimes wheezing and skin rash. All these symptoms are usually referred to as hay fever, pollen allergy or more appropriately allergic rhinitis. Allergic rhinitis is commonly associated with allergic asthma in children and adults.
Allergies, including mild allergic asthma, have not been identified as a major risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection or for a more unfavourable outcome in the studies available so far. Moderate to severe asthma on the other hand, where patients need treatment daily, is included in the chronic lung conditions that predispose to severe disease.
Children and adults on maintenance medication for allergies (e.g. leukotriene inhibitors, inhaled corticosteroids and/or bronchodilators) need to continue their treatment as prescribed by their doctor and should not discontinue their medication due to fears of COVID-19. If they develop symptoms compatible with COVID-19, they will need to self-isolate, inform their doctor and monitor their health as everyone else. If progressive difficulty breathing develops, they should seek prompt medical assistance. <SEP> 8.

Incarcerated and detained people spend almost all of their time within congregate environments where groups of people share the same space, which increases the chance for COVID-19 to spread once introduced. The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into someone’s lungs. Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet). It is possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes; however, this is not the most likely way the virus spreads. COVID-19 may also be spread by people who are not showing symptoms. Learn more about how COVID-19 spreads. <SEP> Do people who are incarcerated (in prison, jail, or detention facilities) have a greater chance of getting COVID-19 than others? <EOS>

COVID-19 has abruptly pushed many people’s daily lives online, and you may be spending even more hours online than before. While online solutions provide huge opportunities for continuing your learning, socializing and playing, you should try to limit the amount of screen time that is not related to your studies or physical activity. This is because you need to be physically active to keep healthy and a positive attitude. In addition, some people are sensitive to flickering lights and may get headaches, nausea, and dizziness, and even seizures if they spend too much time in front of a screen. Therefore it is important to replace some of the recreational screen time with non-screen activities, like listening to music, reading, playing board games, and physical activity, like  going for a walk or jog. Excessive gaming can lead to “gaming disorder” that leads to reduced sleep or day-night reversal, loss of appetite, aggression, headaches, and attention problems. If you experience these symptoms, seek help from your parents or a trusted adult. <SEP> In the lockdown, I am spending much more time online playing games, socialising and studying. Should I be worried about this? <EOS>
Frequently and thoroughly wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.
Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash, or use your inner elbow or sleeve.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
Stay home and self-isolate if you’re sick, and keep your children home if they are sick.
To protect others, wear a cloth face covering when outside your home and yard.
Aim to keep 6 feet of distance between yourself and non-household members.
Limit social interactions. The smallest group in the largest space poses the least risk. <SEP> What can I do to protect myself/my family from getting COVID-19? <EOS>
If you test positive for COVID-19, a New Jersey contact tracer will reach out to you with life-saving information about how best to protect yourself and your loved ones.
COVID-19 is mainly spread from person to person, so contact tracers will ask about where you have been and the people you spent time with recently. With your help, those people will be told they may have been exposed to COVID-19. We will NEVER share your name or personal information.
You will also likely be instructed to self-quarantine, staying home to avoid spreading the disease. Your family members will stay with you. However, there are things you can do to help ensure your family isn't infected and contact tracers can provide more information about how to do that.
Contact tracers will also connect you to medical care and any help you or your family may need during this difficult time. There are many programs in place to help you and your family including medical treatment, unemployment insurance, child care resources, and food assistance. Learn more below.
Can my employer fire me if I was told to quarantine and am not able to go to work?
No. Your employer cannot fire you if you need to quarantine. Your job is protected.
The State of New Jersey passed legislation prohibiting an employer – during this public health crisis – from terminating or refusing to reinstate an employee who has, or is likely to have, an infectious disease which requires the employee to miss time at work.
An employee who requests or takes time off from work, based on the recommendation of a public health professional, may not be terminated or refused reinstatement if the employee is likely to infect others in the workplace. Medical professionals will not be making many of these recommendations.
You can report a possible violation of this law through the New Jersey Department of Labor's Division of Wage and Hour Compliance in English or Spanish.
Can I get treatment if I don't have health insurance?
Free COVID-19 testing and treatment is available at Community Health Centers, also known as Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) to all people whether you have health insurance or not and regardless of your immigration status.
Find a FQHC near you with this search tool, through 211 online, or by directly calling 2-1-1 (support is available in English and Spanish).
If you do not have health insurance or lose coverage, you may be eligible for free or low-cost coverage (www.njfamilycare.org) through NJ FamilyCare, New Jersey's publicly funded health insurance program. NJ Family Care includes CHIP, Medicaid and Medicaid expansion populations and covers doctor visits, prescriptions, vision, dental care, mental health and substance use services and even hospitalization.
Visit GetCoveredNJ (www.getcovered.nj.gov) to see if you qualify or go directly to www.healthcare.gov to enroll in coverage.
Can I use sick leave to quarantine?
New Jersey has some of the most comprehensive Earned Sick Leave, Temporary Disability and Family Leave Insurance laws in the country, which cover all employees -- full-time, part-time, temporary and seasonal.
In addition, a new federal law passed in response to the coronavirus emergency requires private employers with fewer than 500 employees and most public employers to provide emergency paid sick leave and emergency childcare FMLA leave.
Visit nj.gov/labor to learn more about the many state and federal laws or benefit programs that could help you.
NOTE: If you take family leave, when you return to work, you are generally entitled to return to the same position you held before leave. Your employer may not retaliate against you because you took or attempted to take leave under the NJFLA. To find out more or to file a complaint, go to NJCivilRights.gov or call 973-648-2700.
Can I get unemployment if I need to quarantine?
In addition to New Jersey's unemployment, temporary disability, and family leave benefits, there are several programs available to help you.
Under new federal legislation, the CARES Act, New Jersey's unemployment system can help those who are not typically eligible, including:

Independent contractors, the self-employed, "gig" workers, and those looking for part-time work, are eligible (known as "Pandemic Unemployment Assistance")
Those who, under normal circumstances, don't have enough work history or who have exhausted regular Unemployment benefits, are eligible (known as "Pandemic Unemployment Assistance")

In addition, under the CARES ACT, New Jersey's unemployment system can provide more benefits including:

An additional $600 per week, on top of regular and Pandemic Unemployment Assistance benefits through July 25. (known as "Pandemic Unemployment Compensation"). These payments will be issued separately from regular unemployment benefits.
An additional 13 weeks of benefits (known as "Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation")

In total, eligible claimants can now receive up to 59 weeks of unemployment benefits. New Jersey is providing 20 weeks of extended unemployment to New Jersey workers who have exhausted their state and federal jobless benefits. The state extension kicks in after claimants exhaust 26 weeks of state unemployment plus 13 weeks of federal Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation.
To apply, visit myunemployment.nj.gov.
NOTE: Applicants will be assessed first for traditional unemployment insurance benefits. If traditional unemployment benefits are not applicable to that worker, the application may be denied first and then assessed by NJ Department of Labor for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance benefits.
For more information, the Department of Labor has created a Frequently Asked Questions During the Coronavirus Emergency for NJ Workers resource guide.
What if I can't safely quarantine at home?
When a contact tracer calls, they will discuss any needs you may have, inquire about your living situation, and connect you with additional support if you require help. The State is securing beds at hotels, field medical stations, and other locations for individuals who cannot safely quarantine at home.
What if I need help getting food and other essentials during quarantine?
Many pharmacies and grocery stores offer delivery. Please use these services to the extent possible. A friend or relative may also be able to bring you the supplies you need.
Local food banks may also be able to deliver to your home. Contact a food bank in your area and let them know about your situation. To find a local food bank, refer to this directory.
Seniors unable to prepare their meals and have no family member, friend, neighbor or caregiver to help may be eligible for home-delivered meals. Contact your local Area Agencies on Aging for assistance.
In addition, the New Jersey Division of Disability Services provides meals for individuals with permanent disabilities under the age of 60 living alone without support and who have an increased level of risk for serious or life-threatening complications if exposed to COVID-19.
To see if you are eligible or to apply, please call 211.
Beginning May 27, New Jerseyans enrolled in the state's Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) will be able to use their benefits to order groceries online through Amazon and on May 28, through participating Walmarts, ShopRites, and The Fresh Grocers. Recipients can register their EBT card with Amazon at Amazon.com/SNAP. Visit here to learn about Walmart's SNAP online program. Any Walmart, ShopRite or The Fresh Grocer that currently provides online shopping will also accept online ordering with SNAP benefits.
Those in need of food, cash, or other assistance, can learn about what programs are available and how to apply at New Jersey's official COVID-19 website in English and Spanish.
If you are still experiencing difficulties, please call 211, where assistance is free and available in several languages. <SEP> What happens if I test positive?

If the test is performed at DCLS: DCLS performs same day testing for all samples received by noon each day. Positive results are faxed to all non-hospital submitters within 24 hours of test completion and a hard copy is mailed within 2 business days.  Positive and negative results are faxed to hospitals within 24 hours of test completion and a hard copy is mailed within 2 business days. A preliminary report of COVID-19 PCR testing may be sent if additional testing is pending.
If the test is performed by commercial, private, or hospital laboratories: Please contact your laboratory for specific information on turnaround time, as this may vary. Authorized assays for viral testing include those that detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid or antigen. Viral (nucleic acid or antigen) tests check samples from the respiratory system (such as nasal swabs) and determine whether an infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is present. Viral tests are recommended to diagnose acute infection. Some tests are point-of-care tests, meaning results may be available at the testing site in less than an hour. Other tests must be sent to a laboratory to analyze, a process that may take 1-2 days once received by the lab. Testing the same individual more than once in a 24-hour period is not recommended. <SEP> What is the expected turnaround time for reporting of COVID-19 test results? <EOS>
Restaurants and retail food establishments are regulated at the state and local level. State, local, and tribal regulators use the Food Code published by the FDA to develop or update their own food safety rules. Again, there is no current evidence to support the transmission of COVID-19 associated with food or food packaging.
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their mouth, nose, or possibly eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. The coronavirus is mostly spread from one person to another through respiratory droplets. However, it’s always critical to follow the 4 key steps of food safety—clean, separate, cook, and chill—to prevent foodborne illness.
As an extra precaution to help avoid the transmission of COVID-19 through surface contact, we recommend frequent washing and sanitizing of all food contact surfaces and utensils. Food-service workers also must practice frequent hand washing and glove changes before and after preparing food. Include frequent cleaning and sanitizing of counters and condiment containers. Consumers should wash their hands after using serving utensils.
In communities with sustained transmission of COVID-19, state and local health authorities have implemented social-distancing measures which discourage or prohibit dining in congregate settings. We also recommend discontinuing self-service buffets and salad bars until these measures are lifted.
Unlike foodborne gastrointestinal (GI) viruses like norovirus and hepatitis A that often make people ill through contaminated food, SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, is a virus that causes respiratory illness. Foodborne exposure to this virus is not known to be a route of transmission. <SEP> How do I handle self-service food buffets such as salad bars in a retail setting related to COVID-19?

People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease spreads primarily from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth, which are expelled when a person with COVID-19 coughs, sneezes, or speaks. These droplets are relatively heavy, do not travel far and quickly sink to the ground. People can catch COVID-19 if they breathe in these droplets from a person infected with the virus.  This is why it is important to stay at least 1 meter) away from others. These droplets can land on objects and surfaces around the person such as tables, doorknobs and handrails.  People can become infected by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.  This is why it is important to wash your hands regularly with soap and water or clean with alcohol-based hand rub. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways that COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings. <SEP> How does COVID-19 spread? <EOS>

It is wrong for anyone to do this. And it is not your fault in any way. If you are staying in the same house as the person and/or are dependent on him (it will usually be a man), that may make some of the things that you could do difficult, especially during stay-at-home restrictions due to COVID-19. Here are some things that you can consider doing to improve your safety while in the house. You could tell him politely but firmly that you do not want him to touch you and ask him to please stop.You could inform your parents or other caregivers or trusted adult in the house about what is happening.You could inform a trusted adult outside your home such as a neighbour or a teacher or family friend or relative. If you have access to a phone, you could call or text for help and support. This includes calling hotlines/helplines for children and women who are in need of help or feeling distressed or subjected to abuse, or calling a child protection service in your area. Be careful not to leave your phone calls or text messages where anyone else could access them.  If you need to leave the house immediately because he is hurting or harming you, think of discretely (without him overhearing) pre-arranging with a neighbour or trusted relative or family friend to help you leave the house and stay with them until it is safe for you to return home. If you have been sexually abused or raped and need urgent medical help or care, go as soon as possible to the nearest hospital or clinic to ask for medical care.    Read more:  https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/331699/WHO-SRH-20.04-eng.pdf <SEP> I don’t like the way someone touches me at home and we are both at home all the time because of the pandemic.

Yes.  According to the State’s Stay Home Q&A page, “The State
    Public Health Officer does not
    consider in-car activities to be gatherings, if participants stay in their cars and otherwise remain apart from
    individuals who are not part of their households.”  As long as everyone occupying the same vehicle is from the

Coronavirus can spread when people breathe, talk, cough, or sneeze. When someone
               wears a mask, it keeps the virus from reaching other people. This is true even for
               people who feel fine and have no symptoms because they can still be infected and not
               know it.
Wearing a mask also can stop the virus from reaching you. If everyone wears a mask
               when they're out in public, fewer people will get sick. And because children under
               2 years old can't wear masks, they're protected from infection when people around
               them do. <SEP> Why Should People Wear Masks? <EOS>
 As stated in Section IV.D of the FDA's Policy for Coronavirus Disease-2019 Tests, while laboratories are encouraged to submit EUA requests for serology tests, the FDA does not intend to object to the development and use of serology tests to identify antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 by laboratories that are certified under CLIA to perform high-complexity testing, where the test has been validated, notification is provided to the FDA, and certain information (as described below) is included in the test reports.
As stated in Section IV.D of the FDA's Policy for Coronavirus Disease-2019 Tests, the FDA does not intend to object to a commercial manufacturer's development and distribution of serology tests to identify antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 for a reasonable period of time, where the test has been validated and while the manufacturer is preparing its EUA request, where the manufacturer gives notification to the FDA and certain information (as described below) is included in the instructions for use. As noted in the guidance, the FDA believes that 10 business days is a reasonable period of time to prepare an EUA submission for such tests.
For serology tests offered prior to an EUA for commercial manufacturers, or prior to or without an EUA for laboratories, under the policies in Section IV.D of the FDA's Policy for Coronavirus Disease-2019 Tests, information that helps users and patients understand the test results, such as the following, should be included in the test reports and/or the instructions for use:
This test has not been reviewed by the FDA.
Negative results do not preclude acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. If acute infection is suspected, direct testing for SARS-CoV-2 is necessary.
Results from antibody testing should not be used to diagnose or exclude acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Positive results may be due to past or present infection with non-SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus strains, such as coronavirus HKU1, NL63, OC43, or 229E.
Unless and until an EUA is issued that authorizes additional testing environments for a specific test, under CLIA, use of that test is limited to laboratories certified to perform high complexity testing, and at the point-of-care when covered by the laboratory's CLIA certificate for high-complexity testing.
This policy does not apply to at-home testing, including at-home specimen collection. <SEP>  I am developing a SARS-CoV-2 antibody test and want to pursue an EUA.

Even if you are undocumented, you can take sick leave and still get paid  so long as you meet other eligibility requirements. The NYC Department of  Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) created a fact sheet providing an  overview of different types of paid leaves relating to COVID-19 available under  City, state, and federal laws and eligibility for each. Visit the DCWP website to download it in your preferred language. 
If you work in NYC  for more than 80 hours a year, you can earn up to 40 hours of safe and sick  leave each year to use for yourself or to help anyone you consider family under  NYC's Paid Safe and Sick Leave Law. You have these rights no matter what your  immigration status is. Visit the New York City  Department of Consumer and Worker Protection's Worker Rights webpage to find out more.
You may also be  eligible for emergency paid sick leave for COVID-19 under New York State's law  no matter what your immigration status is. Some employers in New York State are  now required to provide at least five days of job protected, paid sick leave to  employees who need to take leave because they or their minor dependent child  are under a mandatory or precautionary order of quarantine or isolation  due to COVID-19. Find out more by visiting the New York State Department of  Labor's New Paid Leave for COVID-19 webpage or call the state's  COVID-19 hotline at 888-364-3065. The City has issued Frequently Asked Questions about obtaining an order  of quarantine.  
Under the federal law, some employers are required to provide all  employees with two weeks of paid sick time for  specified reasons related to COVID-19. For the qualifying employers, employees who have worked for at least 30  days are eligible for up to an additional 10 weeks of paid family  leave to care for a child under certain circumstances related to COVID-19. Undocumented  immigrant employees may also qualify. For more information, visit the U.S.  Department of Labor website.
If you believe an  employer is violating City labor laws, call 311 and say "Paid Safe and  Sick Leave" or visit the Department  of Consumer and Worker Protection website for more information on  how to file a complaint. For New York State labor law complaints, visit NYS  Department of Labor website. For federal labor law complaints, visit  the U.S.  Department of Labor website. <SEP> I am undocumented.

Even if you have been designated as a critical infrastructure worker, you cannot be compelled to work if you have tested positive for COVID-19 and have been instructed by your medical care provider or public health authority to quarantine. During the quarantine period an employer should not require an employee to work outside of the employee’s home or work against physician’s orders. <SEP> Can I be fired for refusing to come to work if I've tested positive for COVID-19? <EOS>
Yes. It is recommended that all persons, with a few exceptions, wear cloth face coverings in public.1 The primary purpose of cloth face coverings is to limit transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from infected persons who may be infectious but do not have clinical symptoms of illness or may have early or mild symptoms that they do not recognize. Cloth face coverings may provide reassurance to others in public settings and be a reminder of the need to maintain social distancing. However, cloth face coverings are not personal protective equipment (PPE) and should not be used instead of a respirator or a facemask to protect a healthcare worker.
[1] Cloth face coverings should not be placed on young children under age 2, anyone who has trouble breathing, or anyone who is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance. <SEP> If an infected person has clinically recovered, should the person continue to wear a cloth face covering in public? <EOS>

Gyms and fitness centers may reopen outdoor spaces so long as they follow required social distancing and other safety protocols detailed in sections 7,8, and 10 beginning on page 13 of Executive Order No. 157 and summarized below.
Licensed health clubs, including gyms and fitness centers, must keep their indoor spaces closed to the public; however, they are permitted to offer individualized indoor instruction by appointment only to individuals and their families, caretakers, or romantic partners.
If multiple instructions are taking place at the same time in the same facility, they must take place in separate rooms or be separated by a floor-to-ceiling barrier that complies with all fire code requirements if they take place in the same room.
Beginning September 1, gyms may reopen indoor spaces so long as they follow the required safety policies detailed in Executive Order No. 181 and the Department of Health's guidance for health clubs/gyms/fitness centers.
What To Expect in Outdoor Spaces of Gyms
The following summarizes some of the protocols contained in Executive Order No. 157. However, this summary is not a replacement for fully complying with the terms of Executive Order No. 157 and businesses should read the full guidance carefully to ensure full compliance.
Gyms and fitness centers must institute the following policies:

Limit total capacity of any outdoor area to a number that ensures that all individuals can remain six feet apart
Require workers and customers to wear cloth face coverings while indoors and in outdoor areas when social distancing is difficult to maintain, except where doing so would inhibit that individual's health
If a customer refuses to wear a cloth face covering for non-medical reasons, then the business must decline the individual entry into the indoor premises
Limit occupancy in restrooms that remain open to avoid over-crowding and maintain social distancing through signage and, where practicable, the utilization of attendants to monitor capacity
Require frequent sanitization of high-touch areas
Limit the use of equipment rented or otherwise to one person at a time, excluding immediate family members, caretakers, household members, or romantic partners, and sanitize such equipment before and after use
Require reservations, cancellations and prepayments be made via electronic or telephone reservation systems to limit physical interactions

What to Expect in Indoor Spaces of Gyms
The following summarizes some of the protocols contained in Executive Order No. 181 and the Department of Health's guidance for health clubs/gyms/fitness centers. However, this summary is not a replacement for fully complying with the terms of Executive Order No. 181 and the Department of Health's guidance for health clubs/gyms/fitness centers, and businesses should read the full guidance carefully to ensure full compliance.
Gyms and fitness centers must institute the following policies:

Limit occupancy of any indoor premises to 25 percent of the stated maximum capacity, if applicable, at one time, excluding staff.
In addition to capacity restrictions, indoor group activities (e.g., classes) can occur but must limit to no more 1 individual per 200 square feet of accessible space or less, AND all individuals must be able to maintain a minimum of 6 feet of distance from other individuals during the entire class.
Conduct a temperature screening and questionnaire of staff and clients upon entrance to the facility.
If individuals attending outdoor classes enter the center premises, whether to use a restroom or otherwise, they must be included in the capacity limit indicated above.
Require workers and customers to wear cloth face coverings while in the indoor portion of the premises, except where doing so would inhibit that individual's health or where the individual is under two years of age.
If a customer refuses to wear a cloth face covering for non-medical reasons and if such covering cannot be provided to the individual by the business at the point of entry, then the business must decline the individual entry into the indoor premises.
One-on-one personal training can occur assuming 6 feet of distance can be maintained for the majority of the training session.
Individual or pair activities which do not involve contact (e.g., racket ball, handball) can also occur.
Keep doors and windows open where possible and utilize fans to improve ventilation.
Inspect and evaluate the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) unit to ensure that the system is operating within its design specifications
Limit locker room use to hand washing and restroom use
In gyms with pools, limit shower use to individually partitioned showers or communal showers with installed barriers/partitions; in other gyms, showers are not permitted
Shared saunas and steam rooms are not permitted.

Guidance For Employees
Gyms and fitness centers must implement safety policies for employees that include, but are not limited to:

Require employees with symptoms of COVID-19 be sent home
Require all employees to wear face coverings while indoors, except where doing so would inhibit the individual's health
Require workers to wear gloves when in contact with customers or goods
Provide all employees with face coverings and gloves free of charge
Provide employees break time for repeated handwashing throughout the workday
Provide sanitization materials, such as hand sanitizer and sanitizing wipes to staff

Samples for COVID-19 tests may be collected through a long swab that is inserted into the nose and sometimes down to the throat, or from a saliva sample.The saliva test is easier to perform — spitting into a cup versus submitting to a swab — and more comfortable. Because a person can independently spit into a cup, the saliva test does not require interaction with a healthcare worker. This cuts down on the need for masks, gowns, gloves, and other protective equipment, which has been in short supply.Either saliva or swab samples may be used for PCR tests, which detect genetic material from the coronavirus. Swab samples can also be used for antigen tests, which detect specific proteins on the surface of the coronavirus. <SEP> What are the differences between the nasal swab and saliva tests for COVID-19? <EOS>
Before touching your mask or face covering, clean your hands with soap and water
               or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
Pick up the mask by the strings or ear loops, if it has them. If you have a cloth
               face covering that does not have strings or ear loops, try to pick it up in an area
               that will not touch your face.
Adjust the strings, ear loops, or cloth face covering so it fits snugly against
               your face. There should be no gaps on the side of your face.

The virus that causes COVID-19 has not been detected in treated drinking water. Water treatment plants use filters and disinfectants to remove or kill germs, like the virus that causes COVID-19. The Environmental Protection Agency regulates water treatment plants to ensure that treated water is safe to drink.
Currently, there is no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 can be spread to people by drinking treated water. COVID-19 is spread mainly through close contact from person-to-person. You can continue to use and drink water from your tap as usual. <SEP> Can the virus that causes COVID-19 spread through treated drinking water? <EOS>
A great resource on contact tracing is this new report from Johns Hopkins and the Association of State and Territorial Health Officers.
Multiple technology platforms are emerging, but technology should be seen as an enabler of a smart, well-explained, coordinated, contact tracing strategy – not as a solution unto itself. Moreover, an effective public health response requires people to be able to explain quarantine and link people to resources that make quarantine possible. Scaling up human resources will be necessary. The report cited above has a section on technology as a force multiplier for contact tracing, as well as cautions about appropriate safeguards. (Dr. Josh Sharfstein, 4/11/20) <SEP> What are the best ways to do contact tracing? Is there an app or tech platform that can do this more effectively? <EOS>
Issue shelter-in-place orders before you obviously need them. Think about the problem you’re going to have in two weeks, because the virus always has a two-week silent head start. Prepare people for the possibility of increased restrictions now. Do not issue a draconian order without foreshadowing and explaining it, because people won’t believe it’s necessary or legitimate. Build its legitimacy before you have to issue it. (Dutch Leonard, 3/19/20) <SEP> How should we think about shelter-in-place orders? Should we issue them now? <EOS>
It's best to prepare before someone in your house gets sick. Here are some ways
               to stock up at home and be ready:

Food and water. Choose food that doesn't need to be in the refrigerator
               and can stay good on the shelf for a long time. Buy canned foods and juices, rice,
               dried beans, granola bars, peanut butter, and dry cereal. Get baby foods, if needed.
               If you have pets, stock up on what they need.
Foods your family likes when sick. These might include things
               like soup, crackers, and fluids to stay hydrated.
Household supplies. Don't forget toilet paper, paper towels,
               shampoo, toothpaste, and dish soap.
Medicines. Make sure prescriptions are filled and on hand. Get
               over-the-counter (nonprescription) fever reducers. Your doctor can advise you on how
               to use them.
A thermometer.
               Depending on your child's age, you might need a digital thermometer, temporal artery
               thermometer, or electronic ear (tympanic) thermometer.
Cleaning supplies. If someone is sick, regularly wipe down things
               that get touched a lot (like doorknobs, cellphones, and handles).
Plenty of hand soap. Using soap and water to wash
               hands when staying home is best. You can use hand sanitizer if soap and water
               aren't available. Safely store hand sanitizer and cleaning products out of reach of
               the kids.
Masks or face coverings. Masks
               are important for going out. But they can also help stop the spread of COVID-19 at
               home. Indoors, anyone who is sick should wear a mask when around others to prevent
               spreading the virus.Kids older than 2 years should wear a mask or cloth
               face covering when in public. Help your kids get
               used to masks. You can make
               them together. Practice wearing them so kids feel more comfortable when they wear
               them or see loved ones wearing them. Children under 2 years old and people
               who have trouble breathing should not wear a mask.

The object is to slow the movement of virus laden droplets in your breath. Therefore, some filter is better than no filter at all. Many types of materials can be used. Look for tightly woven materials with the smallest gaps between threads for the best filtration. Some people have used filters used for liquids (such as coffee filters) or for air cleaners (such as sections of vacuum cleaner bags or air conditioner filters).

CDC is not aware of any scientific reports of the virus that causes COVID-19 spreading to people through the water in pools, including saltwater pools. Plus, proper operation of public pools (such as at an apartment complex or owned by a community) and disinfection of the water (with chlorine or bromine) should inactivate the virus. Saltwater pools are chlorinated pools.
In traditional pools, chlorine products (such as granules or liquid bleach) are added to the water to disinfect it. In saltwater pools, table salt (made up of sodium and chloride) is added to the water, and an electrical current is then run through the water with dissolved salt. This creates the same disinfecting form of chlorine that is created when chlorine products are added to the water in traditional pools. <SEP> Can the virus that causes COVID-19 spread to people through the water in saltwater pools? <EOS>
Presymptomatic describes the 1-3 day period of time where infected individuals have the virus without showing any symptoms, but are still able to transmit it to other people.

Administrators should always reinforce healthy practices among their staff and students, as well as prepare for a potential case of COVID-19, regardless of the current level of community transmission.
As you create and update your preparedness plans, work with your local health officials to determine the most appropriate plan and actions for your school or program. Together, you will need to consider your local community situation—whether you have local transmission in your community, and if so, the level of transmission (none/minimal, minimal to moderate, substantial).
CDC has created overall guidance, as well as guidance tailored for transmission level in your area to help child care programs, schools, and their partners understand how to help prevent COVID-19 and react quickly when a case is identified.  The guidance includes information about the following:

How to prepare if you have no community spread of COVID-19.
How to prepare if you have minimal to moderate community spread in your community.
How to prepare if you have substantial community spread in your community.
What to do if a person with COVID-19 has entered your school.

In some cases the inventory of certain foods at your grocery store might be temporarily low before stores can restock. Based on our ongoing communication with industry, we understand this is largely an issue of unprecedented demand from the retail sector – not a lack of capacity to produce, process and deliver.
Food production and manufacturing are widely dispersed throughout the United States, however; there is a significant shift in where consumers are buying food, because of the pandemic. While food use in large-scale establishments, such as hotels, restaurants, sports arenas/stadiums and universities suddenly declined, the demand for food at grocery stores increased.

Keep in mind that "coronavirus" is actually a broad term that describes a whole family of viruses, many of which cause the common cold. The current global outbreak is caused by a specific "novel" coronavirus that causes the disease COVID-19.  
The vast majority of coronavirus diagnoses will be the equivalent of being told that you have a common cold or flu, so a positive coronavirus test result is not a cause for alarm. This can be very confusing, so please talk to your doctor or care team if you see this word used.

COVID-19 can lead to dehydration, pneumonia, lung inflammation, and septic shock, and about 20 percent of people with COVID-19 require hospitalization. The pressure on the healthcare system is expected to come from people needing treatment, such as intravenous hydration and ventilation.
Early reports from China estimated that about 6 percent of patients needed ventilator support. But only about 25 percent of those who died had been placed on ventilators, suggesting that supply was limiting. Italian physicians recently reported that 10 percent of COVID-19 patients require mechanical ventilation, and Italy may have less than a quarter of the ventilator machines it needs.
US hospitals are taking steps like canceling elective surgeries to free up ventilators that would otherwise be used on sedated patients having procedures like hip replacements, and preparing to move ventilators to hot spots of infection within multi-hospital systems. They are also planning to bring some older models back into use, and the Strategic National Stockpile has 13,000 ventilators that can be deployed as need arises. However, depending on how bad the coronavirus pandemic gets in the US, individual cities could potentially be thousands of ventilators short as patients flood hospitals.

In the past, closing schools does appear to have helped to control the spread of viruses like influenza. This is because children tend to be very susceptible to common human respiratory viruses. They shed, or pass on, viruses at higher levels and for longer than adults, which makes them more likely to transmit the disease and typically have poorer hygiene habits than adults.
Thus, many schools within the United States and abroad have closed in response to COVID-19. But, it's important to note that school closures are not guaranteed to reduce transmission. Timing of the closure is very important. Closures early in the epidemic are more likely to be effective, and they may be ineffective if children just gather in other locations.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a series of guidelines for schools to prepare for the coronavirus. This includes making cleaning supplies readily available, encouraging students and staff to stay home if sick, planning for digital or distance learning, and considering school closures if necessary.

You do not need to stock up, there will still be supplies in the grocery stores. However, it would be a good idea to have plans in case you need to self-isolate and cannot get out. Talk to family, neighbors and friends about helping you to get groceries delivered if you have to get groceries delivered. In turn, offer to help them out if they need it when they are self isolating. Stores will also deliver through online ordering. If you do want to stock up on budget items, stick to canned food and dried foods you can afford and know you'll eat over the coming weeks. Don't buy anything you wouldn't normally get and try to get foods on sale. <SEP> What if I can't afford to stock up on 2-4 weeks of groceries? <EOS>
Caring for the mental health of elders in assisted living or nursing facilities, who are cut off from in-person visits from family as well as interaction with their peers, is an important part of responding to this crisis.
The city of Barcelona offers seniors an application called VinclesBCN to simplify communication by text messaging, photographs, or video for elderly smartphone and tablet users. It allows them to set up a personal network of family and friends as well as a group network of fellow seniors who live nearby or share common interests. It also helps connect them to local online activities.
The app now features a health channel, managed by medical professionals, to provide information on COVID-19 and answer users’ questions via text or voice message. (Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, 4/29/20) <SEP> How can we help seniors isolated by social distancing feel socially connected? <EOS>
 Yes, you can offer your COVID-19 test for at-home self-collection if at-home self-collection is specifically authorized under the EUA for the test.  In addition COVID-19 tests for at-home self-collection may be used as part of an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved study.
The FDA is supportive of at-home self-collection and has authorized several COVID-19 tests for home collection of specimens to be sent to a laboratory for processing and test reporting. These authorizations are specific to the home collection kit and test pairs identified in those EUAs. All tests that have received an EUA, including any authorizations for home collection of a specimen, can be found on our Emergency Use Authorizations page. If you are developing a home specimen collection kit or are interested in adding home collection to your authorized assay, we recommend using the Home Specimen Collection Molecular Diagnostic Template to help facilitate the preparation, submission, and authorization of an EUA. We encourage you to reach out to us at CDRH-EUA-Templates@fda.hhs.gov if you wish to discuss an alternate approach.
As noted in the Policy for Coronavirus Disease-2019 Tests, the policies outlined do not apply to at-home testing, which includes self-collection of a specimen at home, with or without the use of telemedicine, that is then sent to a clinical laboratory.
Home collection raises several issues of importance, including whether the lay user can safely and properly collect the specimen, whether the components of the specimen transport media are safe for use in the home environment (since some may be toxic), proper shipment, and adequate stability of the specimen given the time lapse between collection and testing and the potential impact of shipping conditions (such as, if the specimen sits in a hot truck).
A healthcare provider watching the collection by way of telemedicine may address the issue of proper specimen collection (if the self-collection method does not raise safety concerns) but it does not address the other issues, and specimen stability and shipping conditions are still of concern.
To address the concerns regarding specimen stability and shipping conditions for foam or polyester nasal swabs shipped dry (in an empty tube) or in saline (0.9%), FDA has reviewed analytical validation data from a swab stability study conducted by Quantigen Biosciences, with support from The Gates Foundation and UnitedHealth Group, that can be used, in conjunction with other data from the sponsor, to support sample stability of foam or polyester nasal swabs shipped dry (in an empty tube) or in saline (0.9%) for testing with authorized SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostic assays. Quantigen Biosciences has granted a right of reference to any sponsor wishing to pursue an EUA to leverage their COVID-19 swab stability data as part of that sponsor's EUA request. This data addresses specimen stability and shipping questions but may not address usability questions. At this time, FDA would need to review clinical data supporting dry swab transport (swabs transported in a tube with no media) to better understand its impact on test validity.
Distributors of home collection systems should contact the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) within the Department of Transportation (DOT) to confirm their packaging and shipping instructions will ensure users are in compliance with the hazardous materials regulations for shipping medical material. PHMSA can be contacted at HMInfo@dot.gov.
COVID-19 tests for self-collection of a specimen at home are not eligible to be added to the umbrella EUA for molecular-based laboratory developed tests (LDTs) or the umbrella EUA for SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests. Instead, FDA would authorize individual EUAs for such tests when the criteria for authorization are met and would include any necessary conditions of authorization to address different risks presented by specimen collection at home versus collection in a health care setting. <SEP>  Can I offer my test for self-collection of a specimen at home and shipping to a laboratory for testing?

Pregnant healthcare personnel (HCP) should follow risk assessment and infection control guidelines for HCP exposed to patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Adherence to recommended infection prevention and control practices is an important part of protecting all HCP in healthcare settings. Information on COVID-19 in pregnancy is very limited; facilities may want to consider limiting exposure of pregnant HCP to patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, especially during higher risk procedures (e.g., aerosol-generating procedures) if feasible based on staffing availability.

Prospectively collecting serial respiratory samples and attempting to isolate live virus in tissue culture from multiple persons testing positive by RT-PCR following illness recovery is needed. If repeated attempts to recover replication-competent virus in culture from such serial samples are unsuccessful, that data would be sufficient evidence that infectious virus is absent. Then we would be sure that persons continuing to test positive do not pose an infectious risk to others. <SEP> What further evidence is needed to be reassured that persistent or recurrent shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA after recovery does not represent the presence of infectious virus? <EOS>
